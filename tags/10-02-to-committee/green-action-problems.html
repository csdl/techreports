<TITLE>Problems with green action lists</TITLE>

<BODY>
One popular mode of interaction for encouraging environmentally responsible actions are lists of ``green'' actions. These action lists can be used both to provide an assessment of how green a person is, and to provide suggestions for ways to reduce environmental impact. For assessment, users indicate which actions they have taken (including how many times they have performed some periodic actions) and those actions are converted into some sort of visible assessment. StepGreen (ref) uses action lists to estimate quantitative savings of both money and carbon, while iamgreen (ref) counts actions and displays them as leaves on a tree. In both systems, the entire list of actions is an implicit list of suggestions for users wishing to reduce their impact. Green action lists are also widely used in books and the press as examples of how to reduce environmental impact, such as ``50 Simple Things You Can Do To Save The Earth'' \cite{Earthworks-50-simple-things}.

Unfortunately, green action lists have some severe limitations. Because they describe a variety of complex actions, it would be difficult to automatically sense when users had undertaken an action. In fact none of the systems reviewed provide any automated means for data acquisition, probably for this reason. Manual data entry, especially for periodic actions (how many times have you turned off the lights after leaving a room for 10 minutes since Sunday?) will be spotty at best, since they rely on users' memory of minutiae. Faced with a list of actions to update daily or weekly, most users will choose not to participate.

<p>

There are also fundamental limitations on what green action lists can infer. Since they only capture information about a specific set of green actions, they can only provide estimates of \emph{savings}, rather than an overall carbon footprint. Thus a user that takes a trans-Pacific flight round trip and then recycles aluminum when they get home will see that they saved $x$ pounds of \COtwo, when in fact the air travel has obliterated the recycling savings by multiple orders of magnitude.

When used as suggestions for improvement, green action lists also face problems. Usually the actions are presented as a unstructured list, leaving users to read through them all to see which ones are relevant and/or feasible. If the system designer wants to provide a quantitative assessment of the impact of an action, the actions have to be generated by someone with the time and inclination to investigate the impact. Often this will mean that the system designers themselves have to generate the actions, which will likely lead to the list of actions changing infrequently (such as with StepGreen). If the list of actions is ``crowdsourced'' directly from users, then it will be difficult to provide any quantitative assessment of the result of the action. Getting the actions from users also will require a means to weed out inappropriate or duplicate suggestions, though there are techniques for doing so such as voting, moderation, etc. Green action lists would be much more helpful to users if the system suggesting actively made use of the information available when providing suggestions. For example, if the user has already indicated that they do not own a car, suggesting that they roll down their car windows instead of using the air conditioner is not helpful. Instead, the system should provide pointers to mass transit and carpooling options.

While green action lists have the advantage of being easy to implement and intuitive for users, on the whole they do not appear to be a good way for long term assessment of users' environmental impact. A solution to the problems of green action assessment would be to acquire data using automated sensors (as discussed in \autoref{}). While the set of actions that could be detected with a small number of sensors would be greatly reduced, it is expected that the sensors could focus on the largest contributors to environmental impact. Once assessment is being done using sensor data, some of the problems of using green action lists to suggest improvements described earlier disappear. User-sourced suggestions become more viable, since their impact can be detected via sensor data.
