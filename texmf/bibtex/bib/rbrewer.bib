	Abstract = {SocialSense is a system designed to provide additional social information about nearby people. SocialSense detects Bluetooth devices and uses them to infer the presence of particular people, pulling their profiles and status from online social networking sites. SocialSense differs from 
existing mobile social awareness systems by integrating live feeds from multiple sources. Information is shown to the user via a head-mounted display, and the user controls the system using buttons mounted on a ring input device or ``Magic Ring''. The aim is a system that can be used unobtrusively, allowing users to go about face-to-face interactions in a normal manner.
