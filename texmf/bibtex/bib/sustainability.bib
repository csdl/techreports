@article{Schultz2007SocialNorms,
	Abstract = {Despite a long tradition of effectiveness in laboratory tests, normative messages have had mixed success in changing behavior in field contexts, with some studies showing boomerang effects. To test a theoretical account of this inconsistency, we conducted a field experiment in which normative messages were used to promote household energy conservation. As predicted, a descriptive normative message detailing average neighborhood usage produced either desirable energy savings or the undesirable boomerang effect, depending on whether households were already consuming at a low or high rate. Also as predicted, adding an injunctive message (conveying social approval or disapproval) eliminated the boomerang effect. The results offer an explanation for the mixed success of persuasive appeals based on social norms and suggest how such appeals should be properly crafted. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
	Annote = {Social norms spur action, have started to be used in a variety of campaigns to change behavior like alcohol use.

Rationale for social norms marketing: people overestimate prevalence of bad behaviors, compare their behavior to perceptions of their peers' norms.

Social norms marketing tries to tell people that the bad behavior is less common than believed. Perception of prevalence called ``descriptive norm''.

@article{Bamsey2008FMARS,
	Abstract = {A categorized water usage study was undertaken at the Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station on Devon Island, Nunavut in the High Canadian Arctic. This study was conducted as part of a long duration four-month Mars mission simulation during the summer of 2007. The study determined that the crew of seven averaged 82.07 L/day over the expedition (standard deviation 22.58 L/day). The study also incorporated a Mars Time Study phase which determined that an average of 12.12 L/sol of water was required for each crewmember. Drinking, food preparation, hand/face, oral, dish wash, clothes wash, shower, shaving, cleaning, engineering, science, plant growth and medical water were each individually monitored throughout the detailed study phases. It was determined that implementing the monitoring program itself resulted in an approximate water savings of 1.5 L/day per crewmember. The seven person crew averaged 202 distinct water draws a day (standard deviation 34) with high water use periods focusing around meal times. No statistically significant correlation was established between total water use and EVA or exercise duration. Study results suggest that current crew water utilization estimates for long duration planetary surface stays are more than two times greater than that required.},

\item 4 month mission
\item Tracked all water usage in station using meters
\item During some periods, water usage categorized by manual recording
\item ``Results above also demonstrate that crewmembers used approximately 1.5 L/day less during the detailed study phases than in the non-detailed periods (when categorized water information was not being collected).''
\item Water use was 10\% less during study periods, even though there was no real-time feedback (other than the posted logs themselves)

	Annote = {* mass media advertising campaigns can create awareness, but bad for behavior change
* four steps: identifying barriers and benefits, develop strategy using behavior changing tools, piloting the strategy, evaluating the strategy
* Each form of behavior has its own barriers and benefits
  - Three steps: read up, focus groups/observation, random sample survey
* Seven steps for survey: write survey objective statement, list themes/topics, write survey, pilot with 10-15 people, select the sample, conduct the survey, analyze the data
  - Survey tips: no open-ended questions, limit # of different scales, use 6-7 point scales, is this a question that can be asked as written?, will this question mean the same thing to everyone?, question everyone can and will answer?
* Tools for behavior change
  - public commitments (even small ones) can lead people to follow through with behavior. Group commitments are good too.
  - prompts
  - norms
  - communications
  - incentives

\item Created concepts for different types of displays, showed to households surveyed
\item Decided to try cuckoo clock for displaying carbon emissions (Kuckuck is cuckoo in German)
\item Monitored power and water temperature in one home using custom sensors and Smart-It particles
\item Lots of problems with sensor install detailed in another paper
\item Discussed printout of weeks of data with home occupants, they noticed washing machine was biggest electricity consumer
\item Occupants provided with real time zoomable graph of usage
\item Now exploring less literal interfaces like cuckoo clock
\item Will ambient displays provide larger or more lasting behavior changes?
\item Do people need more information than ambient displays can provide

The massive use of petroleum-based fuels for transportation release vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere--25% of the total worldwide. Options for reducing these emissions include improving vehicle technology, reducing vehicle size, developing different fuels, and changing the way vehicles are used.},

\item CHI has a lot of offer attempts to mitigate climate change
\item what do we mean when researchers say they want to encourage people to be more environmentally responsible?
\item qualitative study of individuals who are making significant effort to be green
\item Trying to inform future designs by documenting existing green practices and beliefs
\item Environmentally inspired people have diverse affiliations, activism isn't always central
\item 35 homes participated, with 56 people
\item recruited through ``contacts in green movements, contacts made at green home tours, and advertising in community email lists.''
\item Participants mostly are bright green environmentalists, believe that technology can help sustainability, rather than all tech should be abandoned
\item participants motivations: ``counterculture bio-centric activism; American frontier self-reliance and rugged independence; and trend-focused utopian optimism.''
\item First group focused on stewardship of the earth
\item Second group into frugality and DIY, patriotism from getting off foreign oil
\item Third group into trend-setting, eco-chic
\item Mentions cleaning refrigerator coils, but apparently that is not helpful (according to another source)
\item Eco home like living on a ship, being in tune with nature
\item Participants reflective of their choices, trying to improve their process through playful analysis
\item Participants into assessing performance of homes, so they can tune them
\item After living in a house for 1.5 years, interest in data collection had gone down, routines had been internalized
\item ``Even for these attentive, active and knowledgeable homeowners, problems with the home (such as a poor insulation seal or an inefficiency in the configuration of the water heating system) were often difficult to detect or diagnose.''
\item Living green a continuous process
\item Participants try improving one area at a time, then move on to next area
\item Participants had an idea of where they were on the path, and what steps lay ahead
\item Many participants wanted to lead by example and inspire others, like driving a hybrid car
\item Individualism, participants didn't feel supported by institutions
\item Implications for design: personal choices
\item depth-based learning, instead of advice systems with list of easy actions, focus in depth on the user's primary motivations
\item mentoring with mentors matched with mentees on the same path but at an earlier stage
\item Allow users to express their identity and their green activities to others via social networks
\item modest mental puzzles that help users explore the outcomes of different actions might be better than just telling people
\item Participants made green living a core part of their lifestyle, but most people aren't willing to do that
\item Need to improve infrastructure as well as individual choices
\item Suggestions on how to create systemic changes
\item digital democracy: how to make views to legislators clear, and show commitment beyond forwarding an email
\item Citizen science, gathering and sharing data

\item Case study of providing instant energy usage information in two homes
\item Studies suggest 10--15% reduction in energy usage from real-time feedback
\item List of energy feedback devices:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Cent a Meter (Island Power and Cenergies)
	\item EMS-2020 (USCL)
	\item EUM-2000 (Energy Monitoring Technologies)
	\item Greenwire Energy Monitor (Greenwire)

	\item The Energy Detective, TED (Energy, Inc.)
	\item Wattson \url{http://www.DIYkyoto.com}
	\end{itemize}
\item Whirlpool corporation built an energy monitor system that monitored load from 14 different circuits in the home
\item lack of research on effect of feedback on time-of-day demand
\item Plug loads can consist of many types of devices, so it is hard for consumers to tell where to put power strips
\item Zero Energy Homes (ZEH) use PV to try to equal the total electrical usage of the home. Feedback systems can motivate occupants to reduce usage to match PV generation
\item Installed The Energy Viewer from Upland Technologies in one author's house
\item Energy Viewer hardwired to breaker box = harder to install
\item Accuracy of 5 watts, doesn't correct for power factor (additional inaccuracy)
\item Data stored in flash memory
\item Can output to Windows computer via serial line
\item The Energy Detective (TED) installed in second author's home
\item Sending unit in breaker panel, receiver plugs into any outlet (data sent over power line)
\item Computes true power every second with resolution of 10 watts, corrects for power factor
\item sends data via power line for display installation anywhere in the house
\item Data from the two meters was accurate enough for feedback for all but the smallest loads
\item Both users found they could track down all but the smallest loads by watching the difference in instantaneous values on the meters. One found a potters wheel left running on the porch for months
\item They describe a protocol for disaggregating electricity usage sing circuit breakers and feedback device
\item Single plug meters can be useful for tracking small loads like cell phone chargers, but cannot track hardwired loads the way a whole-home meter can

\item Having offsets is nothing new, like the selling of indulgences in the Middle Ages by the Catholic church
\item To have real offsets, you need carbon measurement, accounting, and verification
\item Carbon calculators rarely account for upstream emissions
\item Carbon neutral has many different definitions, often used for PR purposes by companies that sell offsets
\item Authors define carbon neutral as ``cancelling out the harm done to the earth's atmosphere by one type of greenhouse gas-generating human activity''
\item Ways to cancel out harm: take \COtwo out of atmosphere by planting/saving trees, electrical generation from non-carbon sources, improve efficiency of electrical usage, processing waste or recycling in way that prevents \COtwo emissions
\item Offsets can be done using Kyoto-compliant carbon trading, or voluntary project-based transactions
\item Calculators have different inputs, so are not directly comparable, which leads to confusion
\item Nice table of carbon calculators, types of inputs, and outputs given a standard input dataset
\item footprints varied between sites, and even for sites that were close, the prices to offset were very different
\item authors suggest transparency of how much of offset money goes to projects
\item if everyone along a supply chain accounts for indirect emissions, then there will be double-counting
\item Carbon Footprint Ltd's offsets go to TIST to plant trees in Kenya
\item TIST unable to get certified from CDM, so can't trade carbon credits on market
\item Tracing BP's carbon offset program leads to Targetneutral, which subcontracts the work to Myclimate, which does CDM work in India, but hard to find concrete documentation
\item Money from carbon offsets bought by consumers might not be used in actual renewable energy plants, it might be used in planning or getting local support.
\item DESI power project started CDM process in 2003, requesting ability to generate offset certificates in 2007
\item Close to 50\% of CDM projects checked were ``not additional to the baseline'', meaning they would have happened anyway
\item Suggests carbon calculators be standardized
\item suggests that offset buyers look at the projects supported, and only buy if they would have supported those projects anyway, regardless of carbon benefits

	Abstract = {What role can social networking Websites play in supporting large-scale group action and change? We are proposing to explore their use in supporting individual reduction in personal energy consumption. In this we summarize some existing uses of social networking on the Web and propose an approach that integrates feedback about ecological footprint data into existing social networking sites and Internet portal sites. Integrating such feedback into popular, commonly used sites allows frequent feedback about performance, while enabling the exploration motivational schemes that leverage group membership. We propose to compare different motivational schemes in three ways: reduction in C02 emission; lifestyle changes; and ongoing use by users who join the site (retention)},
	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item Half of an American's consumption is under their control
\item People don't connect their activities with CO2 emissions
\item Hypothesis: ``virtual social networks membership can be used to motivate personal change, by enhancing actionable suggestions presented to consumers frequently in an integrated fashion.''
\item Piggyback on popular existing social networks and portal sites to give frequent feedback
\item social networking sites frequently used by higher-income households, which also have higher energy consumption
\item If displaying carbon footprint in profile is perceived as negative, then adoption will be limited
\item environmental groups have a presence on social networking sites, but only for information dissemination
\item some environmental sites have added social networking features, but since their audience is people who are probably already reducing consumption, impact is limited
\item Social movement theory suggested as useful for understanding societal-scale changes
\item Propose creating an information display of carbon footprint that can be embedded in MySpace or Google custom homepage
\item Will also show suggestions for reducing footprint and solicit new tips that can be voted on
\item Differences in values correlate with intent, but differences in actual reduction correlate with sociodemographics
\item Different ways to present suggested actions: generic, personalized, values-oriented
\item Use JavaScript to embed interactive suggestion voting into social networks like MySpace
\item Primary focus on self-reporting, but will also allow sensor integration
\item RB using sensor data from all aspects of a user's carbon output, PET could provide highly targeted suggestions: if you fly a lot it could provide suggestions in that area, etc.
\item Supports groups (social network, physical proximity) for comparison
\item Planning first deployment at small college campus
\item Individual goals: users get suggestions on how to reduce footprint, self-report what actions they take, and system updates their footprint and dollars saved
\item Users can set goals, both for themselves, within a group, and between groups
\item Competition for leader board. Try to reduce fake reporting by making actions verifiable. Recruitment is one major action (though doesn't that encourage spamming acquaintances?
\item Planning 4 month study comparing the various techniques (footprint display, individual goals, group goals, competition)
\item Also planning larger scale open deployment, to be promoted via MySpace and Yahoo 360

\item Feedback can increase conservation, but doesn't challenge cultural norms
\item Ethnographic study of 10 households participating in a smart metering trial
\item EcoMeter plugs into any outlet and displays electricity, water, and greenhouse gas emissions in real time
\item Author wants to use feedback to change societal norms for comfort and cleanliness
\item Weekly bathing was recently the norm, now daily
\item Participants did not understand connection between consumption data and their practices
\item Some tasks considered non-negotiable due to societal norms
\item Participants increase conservation by changing technology (CFLs) or minor changes like ``taking shorter showers, doing full loads of laundry''
\item People act the way they do (for cleanliness and comfort) because ``they believe society expects them to'' and because many companies and organizations have a vested interest in keeping it that way
\item Just providing information is not enough, because individuals are constrained by infrastructures and social norms
\item increase social interaction regarding the feedback system by making placement more prominent
\item encourage discussion with household visitors, since people try to conform to expectations of peers
\item Benchmarking against neighbors suggested as way to change norms, but that leads to problems when you are doing better than the benchmark
\item RB changing societal norms seems like one of the hardest possible means for reducing consumption. It also feeds into many of the negative stereotypes of environmentalism: stinky people living in dark, cold homes

It attempts to provide a source of motivations, reduce the corrosive sense of helplessness, and generatesolutions to environmental problems that do not undermine the quality of life of the people who are affected. The altruism-centered approach currently popular in the academic literature, by contrast, is seen as contributing to helplessness and focusing on sacrifice rather than quality-of-life-enhancing solutions. An alternative, the Reasonable Person Model, offers an evolutionary/cognitive/motivational approach to understanding human nature.},

	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item GPS data is currently used in raw form, or with manual annotations
\item Determine transportation mode used from GPS data
\item Users are unlikely to manually tag their GPS tracks with transportation mode because there is no benefit to them, and it can be hard to remember what modes were used
\item Raw velocity isn't enough for mode inference since traffic and weather can impact that
\item Project GeoLife is designed for sharing GPS logs and media created throughout the day
\item GeoLife allows both spatial and temporal searches of GPS tracks
\item Inference can be done offline with uploaded GPS data, or live on mobile devices
\item Tagging GPS tracks on a map with the transportation mode can be helpful in selecting a route between two points
\item GPS track is a set of latitude, longitude, and time tuples
\item Track can be divided into trips if time between two points exceeds a threshold
\item Change points are where transportation mode changes, and segments are a consecutive set of points with the same transportation mode
\item Processing of GPS log: divide into trips, divide trips into segments based on change points, extract features from segments, feed features into inference model, post process transportation inferences
\item There is also a separate path from the features that runs them through a Conditional Random Field as an alternate method of inferring transportation mode
\item Post processing takes inferences with low probability and includes probabilities of changes between transportation modes (Car ->Walk vs Car->Bike)
\item In CRF, the inference for each segment depends on the observation of previous and following segment
\item Change point detection flows from two observations: when changing mode, velocity must be near zero at some point, and walking is usually the separator between modes
\item Segmenting into walk segments and non-walk segments allows the determination of change points
\item Filter walk points from non-walk points based on velocity and acceleration thresholds
\item If length of segment between consecutive points is smaller than a threshold, merge into previous segment
\item If rapid transitions occur between walk and non-walk, then assume the points are non-walk with traffic (or the like) since nobody switches modes multiple times in a short distance
\item Features used: length, mean velocity, expectation of velocity, covariance of velocity, top 3 velocities, and top 3 accelerations
\item GPS data collected from 45 users over 6 months
\item Decision tree provided the best inferences of mode
\item CRF turns out to be not appropriate for this task, since most trips consist of only one or a few segments

	Abstract = {Activity sensing in the home has a variety of important applications, including healthcare, entertainment, home automation, energy monitoring and post-occupancy research studies. Many existing systems for detecting occupant activity require large numbers of sensors, invasive vision systems, or extensive installation procedures. We present an approach that uses a single plug-in sensor to detect a variety of electrical events throughout the home. This sensor detects the electrical noise on residential power lines created by the abrupt switching of electrical devices and the noise created by certain devices while in operation. We use machine learning techniques to recognize electrically noisy events such as turning on or off a particular light switch, a television set, or an electric stove. We tested our system in one home for several weeks and in five homes for one week each to evaluate the system performance over time and in different types of houses. Results indicate that we can learn and classify various electrical events with accuracies ranging from 85-90%. },

	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item The term carbon footprint is being used extensively, but there is no standard, rigorous definition
\item Should carbon footprint include carbon-based gasses like methane, non-carbon gasses that have potent greenhouse gas effects? What about CO$_2$ emissions that don't come from fossil fuels, like soil emissions?
\item Should footprint include just direct emissions, or also upstream emssions? If including upstream, how to set the boundries?
\item What units to use for measurement? Pressure? Area?
\item If using a comprehensive accounting, have to worry about counting emissions more than once
\item Proposed definition: ``The carbon footprint is a measure of the exclusive total amount of carbon dioxide emissions that is directly and indirectly caused by an activity or is accumulated over the life stages of a product.''
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Only include CO$_2$ since that's what we have data on
	\item Defined in mass units, as conversion to area requires more assumptions
	\end{itemize}
\item Can approach calculation either bottom up (Process Analysis) or top down (Environmental Input-Output analysis)
\item Process analysis is used for calculating impact of a product from creation to destruction
\item PA handles mostly first-order emissions, and some second order impacts
\item Defining boundaries is critical for PA
\item PA has problems scaling up to households, industries, or governments
\item EIO works at the economic sector level, including all economic activities and environmental data, using the ``whole economic system as boundary''
\item EIO is not good for micro systems like an individual product, but requires fewer resources once set up
\item Recommended solution is a hybrid, using PA for low-level portions, and rely on EIO for indirect effects.

	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item ``occupant activities and choices control up to 50 percent of residential energy use''
\item Three factors for conservation: knowledge, motivation, and control
\item Dorm residents have no incentive to reduce energy consumption [true for campus buildings too]
\item Households that are environmentally concerned and haven't engaged in conservation practices are most likely to lower consumption with feedback
\item Dorm residents get no consumption feedback, not even a bill
\item Hypothesis: providing feedback will motivate resource consumption in dorms
\item Good socio-technical feedback system lets users teach themselves how to conserve
\item Use web pages to communicate feedback to students, since they have computers and Internet in their rooms
\item What resolution (spatial and temporal) should the feedback have? Utility bills are probably not a good model, real time is better
\item Three resolutions tested: weekly for whole dorm, real-time for whole dorm, and real-time by floor
\item Interventions: web-based feedback, posted educational materials, competition between dorms for biggest resource reduction
\item Dorms could see each other's consumption during competition
\item Energy for heating not accounted for: would need additional meters, and students don't have control over thermostat anyway
\item However air handlers were included in the electricity, which could vary based on temperature. Controlled for by tracking temp at nearby airport
\item Outdoor lighting conditions could also affect lighting usage, lighting was monitored by a weather station on campus
\item Had to develop their own metering infrastructure because nothing appropriate was available
\item Metering granularity set to 20s for the two real-time dorms
\item Web display was in kW with dynamic values from last 20s, and time series of day or week. Also provided cumulative conservation and resulting reduction in pollution
\item Two week dorm energy competition
\item Deliberately left students to their own devices on how to conserve
\item 2 real time dorms have 3 floors: total dorm energy and usage for 2 of 3 floors (last floor as control)
\item Water usage ran into lots of problems
\item 16 dorms completed weekly feedback for electricity
\item Contest prize for dorms with lowest electricity and water usage got an ice cream party
\item Baseline period was 3 weeks before contest, contest ran only 2 weeks, plus 2 week post-competition period
\item High-resolution dorms had kiosk in lobby showing web interface
\item Web interface tracked IP addresses, which could be mapped to dorm and even floor of dorm
\item Four types of assessment: change in usage from baseline, changes of high res dorms compared to low res dorms, usage of web interface, survey of dorm residents
\item Dorms compared by percentage reduction to account for different constructions
\item Outside light and temp only changed slightly between baseline and competition periods, but changed a lot during post-competition period
\item 32\% electricity reduction over all dorms, best dorm reduced by 56\%
\item The 2 high res dorms had the most reduction
\item Per-floor metering display did not seem to make a difference for conservation
\item Equipment cost for 2 high res dorms was \$10K
\item Estimate payback for installing high res metering in all dorms in 2 years for 20\% reduction, and 8 years for 5\% reduction
\item Overhead from high res metering equipment was 600W, or 0.3\% of electricity reduction during competition
\item Based on web interface usage, 46\% of residents looked at the site
\item Web interface was still viewed in post-competition period (29\% as much interest as during competition)
\item 23\% of students in dorms filled out online survey
\item Popular strategies for conserving electricity: turning off bathroom lights, turning off dorm room lights, using natural lighting, turning off computer monitors
\item Some strategies were sustainable (like turning off lights and computers) but others (like unplugging vending machines) were not
\item 35\% of comments said they were already employing some of the strategies before the competition
\item 55\% said they would look at real time data on a website even without a competition
\item Students held planning sessions to figure out how to conserve, and discussed by email
\item Only 10\% attended ice cream party, so perhaps incentive was not important
\item If competition between floors, maybe per floor feedback would be helpful
\item During post-competition period, electricity usage went down (but got warmer and brighter so cannot tell precise cause)

\item Education about global warming is not enough to affect behavioral change
\item EcoIsland attempts to ``motivate behaviour changes that reduce CO2 
emissions''
\item EcoIsland is a backgound game-like activity, with a centrally installed display in the home
\item Each family member has an avatar on the island
\item Family sets target CO2 level, emissions are tracked by sensors and self-reporting.
\item If emissions exceed target level, water level on island rises, eventually ending game
\item Participants have a list on their mobile phone with suggested actions to reduce emissions, and can self-report using the phone
\item Participants can see other islands and trade carbon credits using a virtual currency (repeating allowance provided to users)
\item Currency can also be used to buy decorations, so those with low emissions can decorate their island, but those with high emissions have to spend money on buying carbon credits
\item RB but if target emissions is set by family, can't you do well by setting your target artificially high? Looks like view of other islands shows target for that island, so that's one way to discourage setting bar too low.
\item Goal is to provide metaphor as feedback loop, increasing ecological awareness
\item based on theories of \emph{social facilitation} and \emph{conforming behavior}
\item Since game is played by family unit, ``participants can also agree to assign tasks to certain members.''
\item Current system doesn't have sensors, display uses Flash
\item pilot study with 20 people in 6 families
\item first week instrumented air conditioners with energy meter for baseline usage
\item second week EcoIsland installed with 1 family member using system
\item survey conducted, 17 of 20 participants said ``they were more conscious of environmental issues after the experiment than before.''
\item However users were motivated by game issues (save sinking island, buy items) rather than saving environment (RB but isn't that the point?)
\item few participants used carbon trading system as targets were easy enough to hit without trading
\item air conditioning usage showed no correlation with game, but short study in winter (!!) may have affected that.
\item Participants noted that manual reporting contributed to motivation, so replacing with sensors could reduce motivation

\item Without dynamic information about electricity consumption, hard to figure out how to reduce usage
\item It would be very useful to have usage data from every device connected to power
\item Current tools (Kill-A-Watt, Watts Up Pro) are not feasible since they are not designed for deployment throughout a location
\item Created a system for monitoring multiple plugged-in devices wirelessly
\item Sensor sits between device and output, transmits power usage data to base station using ZigBee
\item Technical details on the prototype can be found at \url{http://www.jeffreyleblanc.org/powermonitoring/}
\item Fundamental question of any conservation system is does the benefit outweigh the cost
\item Costs include electricity usage, plus the construction of the sensor itself
\item User has to decide which devices to monitor, and what goals they are trying to achieve
\item May make sense to monitor devices as groups, such as computer, monitor, and printer
\item Appropriate visualizations may be different for a single user or for multiple users (like members of a household or business)

@article{Hanley2008Do-increases-in,
	Abstract = {Governments world-wide increasingly see energy efficiency as an important aspect of sustainability. However, there is a debate in the literature as to whether the impact of improved energy efficiency on reducing energy use might be partially, or more than wholly, offset through ``rebound'' and ``backfire'' effects. This paper clarifies the theoretical conditions under which such effects would occur and explores their likely significance using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Scottish economy. We find that for Scotland a general improvement in energy efficiency in the production sectors of the economy initially produces rebound effects that eventually grow into backfire. Energy use ultimately increases in response to an efficiency gain and the ratio of GDP to CO2 emissions falls. The economic factors underpinning rebound effects are straightforward: energy efficiency improvements result in an effective cut in energy prices, which produces output, substitution, competitiveness and income effects that stimulate energy demands. However, the presence of strong rebound or even backfire does not mean that efficiency-enhancing policies are irrelevant: rather it suggests that such policies operating alone are insufficient to generate environmental improvements. The implication is that a co-ordinated portfolio of energy policies is required.},
	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item Examining the rebound and backfire effects: energy conservation on the macro level is offset partly or wholly by increased energy usage
\item Increased energy efficiency leads to effectively to a lower price for the same amount of work accomplished
\item rebound is the percentage of gains from energy efficiency lost due to increased energy demand
\item backfire is when rebound is > 100\%
\item If energy demand is relatively price-elastic, then backfire occurs
\item direct rebound effect: impact on activity that is being made more efficient
\item indirect rebound effect: other system-wide impacts resulting from efficiency
\item hard to measure rebound effect empirically, especially indirect effects
\item Created a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of Scotland
\item Complicated discussion of model details
\item Need to use caution when looking at relative sustainability measures, since improved efficiency could increase ratio of GDP to energy or carbon, but if GDP grows then absolute energy and carbon emitted increases.
\item Non-renewable energy generation is more energy intensive than renewable energy generation, so efficiency actually decreases the percentage of energy from renewable sources
\item Under their model, almost all scenarios end up eventually in backfire (ack!)
\item Higher taxes on energy use or a carbon tax could help prevent backfire
\item Energy efficiency can allow carbon taxing without impacting economic activity

@article{Herring:2007eu,
	Abstract = { Does technological innovation to improve the efficiency of energy-using products and systems lead to lower energy consumption and hence reduced environmental impacts? The answer given by economists since the mid-19th century is [`]no'. This is because there are direct [`]rebound' or [`]take-back' effects caused by energy efficiency improvements that lower the implicit price of energy, often leading to greater consumption. Also there are secondary or indirect effects of reducing energy costs through efficiency in that consumers may buy more products and/or choose, larger, more powerful, more feature laden models. Thus just promoting technical innovation to increase energy efficiency is unlikely to lead to reduced energy consumption and emissions. Other policies such as taxation or regulation are required. As well as setting the theoretical arguments concerning innovation and energy efficiency the paper outlines results from an empirical research project, [`]People-centred eco-design', which seeks to identify the key influencing factors on consumer adoption and effective use of energy efficient products and systems. In particular it aims to identify how consumers may avoid (or mitigate) rebound effects and how manufacturers, service providers and government might design and promote such products to achieve their optimal environmental benefits.},

@article{Young:2000fv,
	Abstract = {This article contends that while striving to promote environmentally responsible behavior, we have focused attention too narrowly on just two classes of motives. There is a need to expand the range of motives available to practitioners and to provide a framework within which motives can be evaluated for both their immediate and long-term effectiveness. The article then examines a strategy for promoting environmentally responsible behavior that has significant potential. This strategy is based on a particular form of motivation called intrinsic satisfaction. Nine studies are reviewed that have outlined the structure of intrinsic satisfaction. A key theme discussed is the human inclination for competence. This fundamental human concern is shown to have both a general form and a resource-specific version.},
	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item Motives pursued for environmentally responsible behavior (ERB) constrained to material incentives/disincentives and altruistic reasons
\item ``incentives needed constant reintroduction to remain effective and they proved to be less reliable than we had hoped''
\item Altruism as motive suffers from lack of guidelines for actual use
\item ERB is a result of multiple motives, not just one
\item Two types of evaluation criteria: outcome-based (technique in isolation), and context-based (effect of other factors on technique)
\item Cone and Hayes 1980: ``(a) whether a technique can be reliably implemented by a variety of individuals and (b)its ability to promote durable behavior change''
\item incentives can start ERB, but behavior changes back when incentives end, and even continuing incentives can have low reliability
\item ``psychological reactance, where the recipient does the opposite of what is demanded''. In some circumstances, people do the opposite of the ERB you are asking them to undertake
\item big behavior changes can change the initiators of the change: ``contempt for those 
people he is influencing and self-contempt''
\item The other criterion is the generalizability of a motivational approach to ``other environmental problems, settings, and contexts''
\item Evidence that recycling in the home is predictive of recycling in the office
\item conceptual familiarity might be enough, not just direct experiences
\item Motivators can be more universal (money) or less universal (personal attention)
\item (RB unsurprisingly) ``Motives will be more effective in those instances in which the 
behavior the motive seeks to promote goes to the core of a person's needs or concerns.'' 
\item self-interest generally considered cause of environmental problems: ``focusing 
solely on short-term individual or familial gain to the exclusion of long-term societal or environmental benefits''
\item thesis: self-interest can be a solution to environmental problems
\item self-interest is different from selfishness, self-interest meaning each individual is responsible for getting their own needs met
\item ``although happiness is experienced personally, it is derived from attaining an outcome, any outcome, we care about.'' So improving an ecosystem can make us happy
\item intrinsic satisfaction: ``certain patterns of behavior are worth engaging in because of the personal, internal contentment that engaging in these behaviors provides.''
\item Based on 9 different studies of ERB, author finds 3 intrinsic satisfactions:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item 1. satisfaction derived from striving for behavioral competence
	\item 2. frugal, thoughtful consumption
	\item 3. participation in maintaining a community
	\end{itemize}
\item Competence, enjoyment in completing tasks and solving problems
\item Frugality, enjoyment from ``careful stewardship of finite resources''
\item Participation, enjoyment from participating in community activities. ``eagerness to share news, finding pleasure from working with others toward a common goal''
\item Tested luxury, since that is generally considered the opposite of conservation. Found that participants ``did not view satisfaction derived from luxury as the antithesis of satisfaction gained from the other behavioral patterns''
\item While attitudes and norms can cause behavior change, you also need skills and experience with the change
\item ``Without considering these variables, we make the error of assuming that once people know what they should do and why they should do it, they will automatically know how to proceed.''
\item When using competence as a motivator, need to pay attention to context. People don't like it when they ``cannot advance or utilize their competence''
\item Way to use competence: ``providing a context in which procedural information is readily available and behavior can tentatively be tried in a supportive environment''

	Abstract = {Most householders have only a vague idea of how much energy they are using for different purposes, hence the importance of making energy flows more visible and controllable. There is a lot of interest in the potential for better feedback using improved ('smart') metering, more informative billing and direct display panels. This review considers what is known about the effectiveness of different types of feedback, with a focus on how people change their behaviour.},
	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item Most people don't know how much energy they use, and thus how they could reduce energy usage
\item Feedback allows the user to learn through experimentation
\item Feedback combined with frequent billing is even better
\item Direct feedback usually leads to energy savings of 5-15%
\item ``high energy users may respond more than low users to direct feedback.''
\item Indirect feedback (billing) is better for assessing impacts in efficiency measures, can save 0-10%
\item ``Historic feedback appears to be more effective than comparative or normative''
\item Feedback down to the appliance level is difficult to supply, but users can figure it out from instantaneous feedback
\item Pay-as-you-go electricity can lead to 10-20% savings
\item Online billing is not a substitute for direct display
\item Persistence of savings happens when feedback has led to new habits or undertaking efficiency measures
\item Incentives to save energy lead to savings that disappear when incentives are removed
\item Behavior formed over a 3 month period is more likely to persist than shorter periods
\item ``Energy supply and consumption are sociotechnical in nature: technology and behaviour interact and co-evolve with each other over time.''
\item ``Consumption in identical homes, even those designed to be low-energy dwellings, can easily differ by a factor of two or more depending on the behaviour of the inhabitants''
\item Traditional billing sucks for decision making
\item feedback types: direct (displays, ambient devices), indirect (bills), inadvertent feedback due to microgeneration, utility-controlled feedback (smart meters), energy audits
\item feedback helps build tacit knowledge about supply and use of energy
\item savings from feedback varies depending on technology, context, etc
\item just looking at a standard meter occasionally can help, but not as much as instant feedback
\item Direct feedback on displays leads to savings on the order of 10%
\item Users found pie charts of typical breakdowns of home energy use helpful, even though they were averages as opposed to being drawn from the user's data
\item Simple ambient display (flashing light when temperature outside is below 68 to inform users to turn off air conditioner) provided savings of 16\%
\item Apparently in the UK your meter might only be read once every 2 years, with the bills being an estimate of usage. Yikes!
\item Users might like to see comparative information, but it doesn't necessarily lead to savings. Also, the problem of showing that you are saving more than your comparable group could lead to increased consumption
\item Internal motivation is most important for maintaining savings
\item For people doing microgeneration (like PV) display of energy in and energy out can lead to reduction in electricity consumption by 20\%
\item ``synergies between different types of feedback and between feedback and other types of information.''
\item During CA energy crisis, LBNL made a website that showed current electricity load, capacity, and forecasts for usage. Anecdotal evidence that people changed their usage based on the graphs

@article{Skip-Laitner:2000yg,
	Abstract = { Recent controversy suggests that energy efficiency policies used to reduce carbon emissions might actually increase overall energy consumption. The result would be an unintended increase in carbon emissions. This paper examines the underlying issues of this so-called ``rebound effect'' from both a historical perspective and through the results of a recent macroeconomic analysis completed for the United States. Depending on the assumptions of income and price elasticities, as well as the supply/demand interactions within a macroeconomic model, the rebound effect might reduce overall savings by about 2-3% compared to a pure engineering analysis. In other words, an economy-wide, cost-effective engineering savings of 30% might turn out to be only a 29% savings from a macroeconomic perspective. Despite the impact of a rebound effect, the net result of energy efficiency policies can be a highly positive one.},
	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item Question: does energy efficiency save energy at the macro level, or does it encourage greater use?
\item If true, then energy companies should lobby heavily for efficiency measures
\item Khazzoom introduced rebound effect: because efficiency reduces cost of energy, which offsets some of the savings
\item Brookes suggested ``if reductions in energy use per unit of output are cost-effective, then such reductions would lead to increases rather than decreases in energy use within the larger economy.''
\item US energy intensity decreased since 1973 (energy per dollar GDP)
\item reduction due to energy efficiencies and structural changes in economy (more service-based than manufacturing)
\item However overall consumption is rising (78.4 exajoules in 1973 and 100 exajoules in 1998)
\item ``there is the very real possibility that energy efficiency investments will improve overall national income and reduce energy prices.''
\item ``That greater level of income, coupled with possibly lower energy prices, may cause overall energy use to rebound at a faster clip than the rate of efficiency improvements.''
\item Presents an equation that relates future carbon emissions to current carbon emissions, increases in GDP and energy costs, and elasticities of income and energy prices
\item based on the simple model, rebound effect from improved efficiency might increase emissions only 2.4\%
\item RB energy prices have increase dramatically since this paper was written, so more evidence that rebound effect is minor
\item Many people believe that reducing GHG emissions and increasing GDP are contradictory
\item However EPA/LBNL analysis shows that there substantial improvements in the economy's carbon efficiency can be made, reducing emissions while increasing GDP
\item EPA/LBNL analysis using National Energy Modeling System
showed that an ``energy-efficient/low-carbon technology path'' would suffer from a rebound effect of only 2.2\%
\item Reductions in energy usage due to efficiency could be undone if energy users use the reduction usage to increase consumption

@article{Greening2000Energy-efficiency,
	Abstract = { Technology policies are one of the options available for the reduction of carbon emissions and the usage of energy. However, gains in the efficiency of energy consumption will result in an effective reduction in the per unit price of energy services. As a result, consumption of energy services should increase (i.e., ``rebound'' or ``take-back''), partially offsetting the impact of the efficiency gain in fuel use. Definitions of the ``rebound'' effect vary in the literature and among researchers. Depending on the boundaries used for the effect, the size or magnitude of this behavioral response may vary. This review of some of the relevant literature from the US offers definitions and identifies sources including direct, secondary, and economy-wide sources. We then offer a summary of the available empirical evidence for the effect for various sources. For the energy end uses for which studies are available, we conclude that the range of estimates for the size of the rebound effect is very low to moderate.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the debate in the UK and the USA on some economists' claims that improving energy efficiency will lead to a greater energy consumption (than would have otherwise occurred), a concept termed the Khazzoom-Brookes postulate. It analyses the criticisms of this claim and of the responses, particularly of the concept of [`]dematerialization'. The paper attempts to tackle the paucity of empirical evidence in the UK by looking at long-term trends in efficiency and use with respect to UK public lighting. Finally, it focuses on the views of two economists, namely Len Brookes and William Rees, who both accept the postulate but have differing views and policies on measures to reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Brookes believes in free-market solutions, whereas Rees puts forward a vision of a sustainable future based on ecological tax-reform and reafforestation.},

	Address = {New York, NY, USA},
	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item Human activity sensing done two ways: fine-grained wearable sensors, or coarse-grained location sensors
\item Want to be able to detect transportation mode from GPS data
\item People are sharing GPS tracks online, being able to label with transportation mode would be useful
\item Simple classification techniques don't work because people switch modes of transportation during a trip, and velocity alone isn't good enough
\item Aiming to infer modes: driving, walking, taking a bus, and riding a bicycle
\item Parkka et al use multiple sensors to detect different types of activity, but multi-sensor is hard to adopt
\item Current work differs from previous GPS transportation recognition by not using map data and allowing individuals data to improve models both for the user and all users
\item GPS position and time data is used to create trajectories, divide into trips based on time gaps, and then find change points where mode of transport changed
\item segmentation is done by realizing that people stop to change transportation modes, and walking is generally the transition between modes
\item segmentation is discussed in more detail in paper from WWW conference
\item WWW paper showed Decision Tree as best inference model
\item Using three features for learning:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Heading Change Rate: cars must drive on the road, walkers or bikers change their heading more frequently
	\item Stop Rate: busses and walkers stop more than cars, so count number of stops per unit of distance
	\item Velocity Change Rate: change in velocity between two GPS points, as humans speed up and slow down more than cars
	\end{itemize}
\item Take GPS logs labeled with ground truth and cluster them into nodes where people frequently start/stop trips or change transport modes. Use density-based clustering algorithm.
\item Create graph from clustered nodes, and use ground truth to produce probabilities for the transportation mode for each edge, and the probabilities of mode transitions at nodes
\item If users mostly take the bus between two nodes, then the nodes are likely bus stops
\item use the graph for post processing, to lock in inferences with high probability and weed out false predictions
\item experiments done to test new features extracted from GPS data, and graph-based post-processing
\item evaluation based on percentage of segments correctly inferred, and also a distance-based measure (since errors on short segments are less important than errors on long segments)
\item GPS data from 65 users over 10 months
\item Subjects shown their data on a map daily to allow them to manually label the trajectories for ground truth
\item experimentally determined what thresholds to use for the 3 new features
\item Accuracy with enhanced feature set is only 0.728 based on the distance of segments. That's not very high, 1 in 4 segments misclassified.
\item The fancy graph-based post processing only improves accuracy to 0.762
\item This state-of-the-art accuracy seems only useable if you are having users check the results on a map on a frequent basis. Personal commute patterns could also be helpful when analyzing on the personal level.

	Abstract = {This paper explores the use of location-awareness to dynamically optimise the energy consumption of an office. It makes use of high-accuracy location data collected over 60 days randomly selected from a year in a commercial environment to evaluate the potential for energy savings and to motivate techniques that might be used.

The results suggest that the energy expended on lighting and fast-response systems could have been cut by 50%; that 75.8% of the average user's working day was spent in their office; and that around 140Wh per PC per day could have been saved, compared to a policy that had machines on for the entirety of the working day. We also find inconsistent office usage that would make optimising slow response systems much harder.},

	Abstract = {Rising global energy demands, increasing costs and limited natural resources mean that householders are more conscious about managing their domestic resource consumption. Yet, the question of what tools Ubicomp researchers can create for residential resource management remains open. To begin to address this omission, we present a qualitative study of 15 households and their current management practices around the water, electricity and natural gas systems in the home. We find that in-the-moment resource consumption is mostly invisible to householders and that they desire more real-time information to help them save money, keep their homes comfortable and be environmentally friendly. Designing for domestic sustainability therefore turns on improving the visibility of resource production and consumption costs as well as supporting both individuals and collectives in behavior change. Domestic sustainability also highlights the caveat of potentially creating a green divide by making resource management available only to those who can afford the technologies to support being green. Finally, we suggest that the Ubicomp community can contribute to the domestic and broader sustainability agenda by incorporating green values in designs and highlight the challenge of collecting data on being green.},
	Address = {New York, NY, USA},
	Annote = {\begin{itemize}
\item Found users unaware of in the moment resource consumption both for individual appliances and total home usage.
\item Prior research shows that ``households can have up to 10\% energy savings with small changes in behavior.''
\item ``Yet, in a study designed to elicit information on what people value in their homes, energy saving was found to be
the value least related to technology''.
\item Qualitative study of how people manage energy usage in the home
\item Goal is to ``help Ubicomp researchers create residential resource consumption management systems.''
\item examined natural gas, electricity, and water usage
\item People argue over thermostat settings within the home
\item Half of homes with programmable thermostats hadn't programmed them
\item ``providing a history or projected resource consumption for a housing unit would help householders' better set expectations of resource usage in a new setting.''
\item Flat-rate utility situations lead to lack of motivation for conservation
\item [RB] landlords have little incentive to pursue resource efficiency because tenants often pay the utility bill(s)
\item Utility bills problematic because ``often the units of measurement were not easily correlated with consumption habits or were not easily quantifiable.''
\item Participants wanted real time information on usage, on utility pricing (if there is peak load pricing), and also alerts if there is anomalous usage (like a broken toilet using lots of water)
\item Participants want more game-like competition, both per person and across people. Like Prius display.
\item Privacy issues: inferring habits from resource usage, feeling shame if one is wasteful
\item Modern infrastructure is invisible: you don't have to know how much energy an appliance uses when you plug it in
\item Authors suggest visualizations ``that equate our resource usage with units of production, for example, buckets of water, bags of coal, stacks of wood, as well as a monetary amount.''
\item Good point about households being made up of multiple people with different levels of interest in being green and different responsibilities (some may not have to pay the bills!)
\item Green divide: need to make sure devices to support resource conservation are affordable to all
\item Non-liberals may not be comfortable discussing resource usage (being green is related to moral attitudes), or have active opposition to conservation due to liberal associations

	Abstract = {The Personal Environmental Tracker (PET) is a proposed system for helping people to track their impact on the environment, and to make changes to reduce that impact, creating a personal feedback loop. PET consists of sensors that collect data such as home electricity or gasoline usage and send it to a database for analysis and presentation to the user. By collecting data from diverse sources, PET can help users decide what aspect of their lives they should make changes in first to maximize their reduction in environmental impact. PET's open architecture will allow other ubiquitous sustainability researchers to leverage the infrastructure for research in sensors, data analysis, or presentation of data.},
