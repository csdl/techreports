      <h1>Round 2 Project Plan</h1>

<h2>Goals</h2>
The goals of Round 2 are to:
<ol>
<li> Make improvements in our software development capabilities by
improvements to and greater adherence to the CSDL/Baseline process.

<li> Create a functioning version of the TRL Active Entry window.

<li> Support revision of the TRL GUI over time. 

<li> Support initial evaluation of our approach to automated tool
support for the PSP.
</ol>


<h2>Interface</h2>

Recall that the current vision of the TRL interface looks as follows:
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr><th colspan=14>TRL Active Entry
<tr><td>12/03/96
    <td>Pali/1
    <td>Reqs
    <th>Start<td>01:14
    <th>Stop<td> 01:52
    <th>Int<td>0:03
    <th>Elapsed<td>0:35
    <th>Add
    <th>Log
    <th>Quit
</table>
</center>
<p>


<h2>Project Summary</h2>

All GUI objects have effectively two interfaces: a "programmatic" interface
which enables other system components to manipulate the appearance and
behavior of the GUI, and a "user" interface that allows a human to interact
with the system. A single human interaction must often "signal" multiple
events, and one of our design challenges is to solve and standardize the 
mechanisms (events, callbacks, explicit method invocations) used to do
this signalling. 


<dl>
<p><dt> 1. TimeLog
   <dd> The TimeLog class provides an interface for File I/O of .trl files and
        in-memory storage of .trl data. 
        For file input, it uses the PSPFile class to get valid .trl files. 
        For file output, it writes a file in TRL-compliant format.
        It also provides an interface to .trl entries for TRLActiveEntryGUI.

<p><dt> 2. ProjectLog
   <dd> The ProjectLog class provides an interface for read-only access to .prj files and
        in-memory storage of .prj data. 
        It uses the PSPFile class to get valid .prj files. 
        It also provides an interface to .prj entries for the PhaseGUI and ProjectGUI
        classes.

<p><dt> 3. DateGUI
   <dd> The DateGUI class provides a GUI encapsulation of the PSPDate class.
        Users can pass a PSPDate instance to a DateGUI constructor, or 
        obtain the current state of a DateGUI instance as a PSPDate object.
        <p>
        Note that the DateGUI class must provide (at least) two
        GUI representations: one that provides MM/DD/YY, and one that
        provides HH/MM/SS.
        <p>
        It must also implement some means for the user to change the
        current value. 

<p><dt> 4. DurationGUI
   <dd> The DurationGUI class provides a GUI encapsulation of the Duration class.
        User manipulation of the value must also be supported.

<p><dt> 5. PhaseGUI
   <dd> The PhaseGUI class implements a button that when pressed, pops up a
   menu of the currently defined phases. It uses the ProjectLog class to
   obtain the current phases.


<p><dt> 6. ProjectGUI
   <dd> The ProjectGUI class implements a button that when pressed, pops up a
   menu of the currently defined projects. It uses the ProjectLog class to
   obtain the current projects.
   
<p><dt> 7. TRLActiveEntryGUI
   <dd> Provides the GUI "manager" that displays and maintains consistency
   between the various date, project, phase, and duration data. 

<p><dt> 8. StringUtils
   <dd> Jennifer has identified a need to provide a simple (static) package
   of string utilities to perform common string conversion operations
   simply. For example:
<p>
   <tt>csdl.java.util.StrUtil.strToInt("123")</tt>  returns the int 123
   

</ol>
