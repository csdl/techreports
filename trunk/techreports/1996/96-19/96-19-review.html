      <h1>PSP/Baseline SRS Review Summary</h1>

<h2>Critical Defects/Changes</h2>

This section summarizes the most important changes to be made to the 
SRS.

<p><hr>
<h3>(1) .prj file syntax</h3>

The contents of the .prj file is not specified precisely:

<blockquote>
Each .prj file contains project information.  The file is a
mixture of comment lines and project information lines. Each 
project information line has the following format:
<pre>
&ltproject&gt {&ltproject_info_file&gt}*
</pre>
where
<ul>
<li> any field may be empty
<li> each field is separated by a tab.
<li> &ltproject&gt is a description.
<li> there are zero or more occurrences of &ltproject_info_file&gt 
<li> &ltproject_info_file&gt is a description.
<li> <b> each &ltproject_info_file&gt is either a .phase file or a .doctype
file</b>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><hr>
<h3>(2) Newline representation</h3>

The following functional requirement will be added:

<blockquote>

<h3>Both PC and Unix EOL representations are supported.</h3>

<dl>
<dt> Description
<dd> Both the Unix newline character (carriage return) and the PC newline
character combination (carriage return/line feed) must be supported.
<dt> Technical issues
<dd> This affects file processing. Files should be read in either format.
They should be written in the format they were read in with.  New files
should be written in the format appropriate to the platform they were
created on. 
<dt> Risks
<dd> Lowered usability.
<dt> Dependencies
<dd> Affects all file I/O. Also, we need to record the newline state when
reading a file in. 
</dl>
</blockquote>



<p><hr>
<h3>(3) Command line processing via .config files</h3>

The following functional requirement will be added:

<blockquote>

<h3>.config files can be used instead of command line arguments.</h3>

<dl>
<dt> Description
<dd> PCs typically run applications via "double clicking", obtaining their 
command line arguments from a .config file.  Applications should be able
to be invoked with no arguments and read their arguments from an
appropriate .config file. For example, the TRL tool when invoked
with no arguments will look for the ./trl.config file, 
the DRL tool will look for the ./drl.config file, and so forth.
<dt> Technical issues
<dd> This should  allow indirection. In other words, a .config file
should be able to contain another .config file as one of its entries.
<dt> Risks
<dd> Few. 
<dt> Dependencies
<dd> Affects all file I/O. 
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p><hr>
<h3>(4) Help</h3>

The following functional requirement will be added:

<blockquote>
<h3>On-line help information should be provided.</h3>

<dl>
<dt> Description
<dd> The "status" line for the various tools should also be available for 
providing help information. For example, whenever the mouse passes over a
button, a descriptive message indicating the function of the button should
be displayed in part of the status line. (The status line could be broken
into regions, such that the "Ready" message could be displayed along with
help information.)
<dt> Technical issues
<dd> Unclear as to how efficiently livetable/Java will implement this.
<dt> Risks
<dd> Few. 
<dt> Dependencies
<dd> 
</dl>
</blockquote>

<p><hr>
<h3>(5) Whitespace rather than Tab as the field delimiter.</h3>

Anne has bitter experience using tab as a delimiter. Some editors
silently replace tabs with spaces, others insert tabs, etc. She 
believes (and I agree) that manual editing of tab-infested files
will prove to be a head-ache.
<p>
An alternative is to use any whitespace as the field delimiter. 
This has the following implications for the four primitive persistant "data
types" in PSP/Baseline (dates, durations, descriptions, and numbers).
<ul>
<p><li> Dates.  Their format must be changed to eliminate whitespace from:
<pre>
YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS
</pre>
to something like:
<pre>
YYYY/MM/DD-HH:MM:SS
</pre>
<p><li> Durations.  Unchanged.
<p><li> Descriptions. Descriptions must have their own delimiter, such as a
quotation mark.  (This means that internal quotation marks must themselves
be escaped, such as by double quotation marks or `\"'.) 
</ul>
      <p>
<p>
<b>Problems</b>
<p>
Delimiting descriptions creates some new ugliness: file names, phase names,
document type names, and so forth will all require delimiters under this
scheme. 
<p>
Using arbitrary whitespace as a delimiter also complicates the representation of a 
"missing" field. We may need to define "null" dates, durations,
descriptions, and numbers. 

<p><hr>
<h3>(6) "Command Post" project</h3>

A new project should be defined whose goal is to provide a single 
point of entry to the entire PSP/Baseline system. In Star Trek 
terms, we need a "bridge". 

<p><hr>
<h3>(7) Default process data files.</h3>

If the TRL (or DRL or PCL) tool is invoked without a .trl (.drl/.pcl) file
argument, then it should look for/create a file called default.trl
(.drl/.pcl) in the current directory.  The goal here is to simplify 
initial setup of the system.  If process data files can be defaulted,
then a set of "standard" .config files can be created with the process
elements that can be used by novices to run the system without 
complicated setup.


<p><hr>
<h3>(8) Command line processor project.</h3>

The following project will be added:

<blockquote>
<h3>2.5 FileArgs/1 Project</h3>

Requirements: 
<ul>
<li> Build a FileArgs.java class that is responsible for
parsing the command line args or the (possibly embedded) .config
files and returning a FileArgs object that contains a vector
of each file type.

<li> FileArgs should do some initial error processing. For example,
it could call FileCheck to make sure the file exists and is of the
appropriate syntactic structure. 

<li> If process data files are not supplied, FileArgs is responsible
for determining this and looking for the appropriate default.* file. 

</ul>
<p>
Project dependencies: None.
