CSCW architectures provide a great variety of sophisticated representations
for the <EM>products</EM> of collaboration. For example, GroupKit represents a
graphical image constructed by a group as the sequence of Tcl commands used
to construct it. (When a new user joins a group in-progress, the system
``replays'' the commands used to construct the artifact for the new user,
synchronizing them with the group.) The WWW architecture supports an
extensible set of representations for artifacts, including HTML,
postscript, audio, and so forth. Lotus Notes also supports many different
representations for the products of collaboration.
<P>
However, CSCW architectures provide much less variety in representations
for the <EM>state</EM> of collaboration.  The WWW architecture, for example,
defines no representations for state.  Most http servers do support log
files, which provide a kind of ad-hoc state representation, but the
provision and use of this state information falls well outside the province
of the Web's architecture.
<P>
Similarly, Lotus Notes does not provide explicit mechanisms or support for
state representation independent from artifact data.  State information
is represented and manipulated exactly like artifact information: as a Lotus
Note or Note field.  Further, a Lotus Note is a restricted kind of data structure
implementing a kind of ``form''.  The Notes architecture does not provide
explicit support for common data abstractions (such as lists, sets, trees,
graphs, etc.)  useful for state representation and manipulation.  While
Notes developers demonstrate great ingenuity in simulating
higher-level data abstractions using interconnected collections of Notes,
they succeed in spite of the architecture, not because of it.
<P>
GroupKit provides a single, yet sophisticated mechanism to represent state,
called an environment. Environments are table-based data structures that
allow users to associate keys with values (which in turn may be another
environment object).  Furthermore, functions can be attached to the add,
change, and delete operations on an environment. These functions can be
used to implement shared environments which maintain common values across
all clients, or support other forms of coordination.  Environments provide
better support for arbitrary state data structure definition than that
provided in Notes, although certain data structures require some twisting
to fit within the table representation.
<P>
The Egret architecture implements state storage and retrieval mechanisms
that provide explicit and high-level support for common patterns across our
various application development efforts. For example, the gtable class
implements a shared, persistent global table which is locally
replicated. Gtables are similar to GroupKit's environments, except that
gtables are persistent across sessions while environments are not.  Gtables
provide high-level support for situations in which each client needs fast
access to state data (thus the local replication), some of which may be
produced or used by other clients as well (thus the shared structure), and
which must persist across sessions.
<P>
However, gtables are not always the right answer. In other situations,
clients require fast access to state data that they themselves generate
(perhaps from previous sessions), but which other clients need rarely or
never.  In this case, gtables are inappropriate: each client will suffer
the overhead of real-time maintenance of (potentially large amounts) of
useless state information concerning other clients. For this situation,
Egret provides the ptable class, which implements a separate table for each
client that is locally cached and persistent across sessions.  In addition
to gtables and ptables, Egret provides other state storage facilities,
including server nodes, system nodes, personal nodes, and system tables.
Yet others result from the combination of these primitive building blocks.
<P>
Finally, in addition to the above mechanisms, Egret supports any data
structure that can be easily passed to a Lisp reader.  Thus, linked lists,
sets, trees, and so forth are simple to construct and manipulate in Egret.
