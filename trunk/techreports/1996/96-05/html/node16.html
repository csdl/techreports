<P>
One lesson from our experiences with CSCW application development is that
it is possible to collect a lot of <EM>potentially</EM> useful state information
about the artifacts, individuals, processes, and the external environment
surrounding collaboration. Whether this state information is <EM>actually</EM>
useful depends upon whether it is located at the right place at the right
time.  The right place, for some users at some points in time, may be the
server, while the right place for other users at other times may be the
client.  Different CSCW architectures make different choices about where
state information is maintained, and whether or not the decision can be
changed dynamically as circumstances require.
<P>
An example from our development experiences may make these issues more
clear. The AEN collaborative hypertext authoring application supports a
dynamically generated table of contents that represents a linear traversal of
the accessible portions of a document's sectional structure.
(The sectional, or logical structure of the document is not usually
isomorphic to the document's hypertext storage structure.)  The TOC is
context-sensitive to both the state of the artifact and the state of the
user.  First, only those sections for which the user has read access are
displayed in the TOC. Second, the sections which are newly created or which
have been modified since the last time this user retrieved them are
represented in bold font.  This sensitivity to the state of the artifact
and the state of the user means that the TOC can potentially change each
time any node is written by any user or an access control value is changed.
Figure <A HREF="node16.html#figtoc">2</A> illustrates one such table of contents.

<STRONG>Figure 2:</STRONG> The ``TOC'' mechanism in AEN displaying the hierarchical section-based
structure 
of a sample document. Each hypertext node can contain an arbitrary number
of sections, which could be actual text or links to other nodes. 
Each user sees only those sections for which they have read access, and 
sections which have changed since this user last read them are bold faced.<BR>
<P>
<P>
A responsive TOC mechanism requires a CSCW architecture to provide flexible
support for location of state information.  For example, if state
information is located only on the server side, then each time a node is
written by one user, all other users must retrieve the node from the
server, parse it to determine the logical structure, and finally rebuild
their TOC.  (Due to embedded links, the logical structure of an AEN
document can change almost arbitrarily when a hypertext node is written.)
The overhead of these three activities on clients is unacceptable during
active collaboration.
<P>
AEN solves this using Egret facilities that allow portions of the document
structure state to be replicated at the clients.  When an AEN client writes
out a document node, it also parses the document to determine if any
structural changes have occurred since it was last written.  If changes
occurred, it ``piggy-backs'' information onto the write event broadcast to
all clients that adds information specifying exactly what structural
changes occurred in this node.  This approach reduces the overhead of table of contents
maintenance for non-authoring clients to only the third activity:
rebuilding the table.  Furthermore, rebuilding occurs only when the
TOC has actually changed. There is a minor amount of new overhead on
the authoring client to parse the node for structural changes, but this
activity can be done quite efficiently because the node is already local to
the client.  Were the parsing overhead substantial, it could be off-loaded
to an agent quite easily.
<P>
The TOC facility demonstrates a situation in which the
availability of a context-sensitive, time-dependent service depends upon
whether or not the architecture can support locating ``just the right
amount'' of state information at each client, keeping the rest on the
server. We hypothesize that neither the WWW, nor GroupKit, nor Lotus Notes
architectures can support this mechanism responsively.  The WWW cannot
because it does not support local state replication. GroupKit cannot
because it does not support persistent state across sessions.  Lotus Notes
cannot because it lacks the state data abstraction mechanisms required to
collect, process and represent this information efficiently.
