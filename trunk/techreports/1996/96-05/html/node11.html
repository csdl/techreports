<P>
The dimensions of state identified above are not a checklist, such that the
more facilities for state representation and manipulation an architecture
supports, the better and more generic it is.  In fact, we have found the
opposite: the inclusion of certain state mechanisms appears to make an
architecture more specialized and less generic. Further, the ultimate
utility and value of a system depends upon much more than its state
representation mechanisms.  A CSCW architecture may consciously and
correctly sacrifice certain state facilities to increase its overall
utility, as we shall see below.
<P>
The benefit of using state as an organizing principle for CSCW
architectures is that it helps illuminate the tradeoffs between
expressiveness, responsiveness, scalability, and usability that must be
made.  It also provides insight into opportunities for improvement, by
illuminating mechanisms in one architecture that may prove valuable to
another. Finally, it tends to shed light onto the underlying, often
implicit assumptions about the types of applications, process, or users
that guided the designers of the architecture.
<P>
This section revisits the dimensions of state, this time using them as a
mechanism for focused inquiry into the nature of several CSCW
architectures: WWW, GroupKit, Lotus Notes, and Egret.  These architectures
were chosen because they form an interesting cross-section of design
choices; analysis of the state properties of other CSCW architectures, such
as Hyper-G [<A HREF="node24.html#Andrews95">1</A>], would also be interesting and useful.
<P>
The WWW needs no introduction for the CSCW community, of course.  In this
discussion, however, the architectural model of WWW is viewed in a somewhat
narrow fashion.  For example, although many agents (a.k.a. ``spiders'') run
over the WWW, we do not view this architecture as agent-based. The WWW is
unlike Egret, for example, which requires autonomous agents as part of its
core implementation.  Agents in WWW are incidental, not essential to its
architecture. Most interestingly, the http protocol underlying the WWW is
defined as ``stateless'' [<A HREF="node24.html#BernersLee94">2</A>].  This design decision
provides superb scalability, but greatly constrains the possibilities for
state collection and manipulation.
<P>
GroupKit is ``a groupware toolkit that lets developers build applications
for synchronous and distributed computer-based conferencing''
[<A HREF="node24.html#Roseman95">9</A>]. This CSCW architecture includes a run-time infrastructure
for process management, groupware programming abstractions, user
interface widgets, and session management mechanisms.
<P>
Lotus Notes is a toolkit for building distributed, primarily
asynchronous conferences [<A HREF="node24.html#LotusNotes">3</A>].  In this architecture,
developers build structured forms (or ``notes'') which members of the
collaborating group create, view, and modify.  The database of notes can be fully
replicated to remote sites, or accessed via a centralized server in a
client-server architecture. Version 4.0 of Lotus Notes is expected to
support agents for both servers and clients.
<P>
Egret is a ``multi-client, multi-server, multi-agent'' architecture for
building collaborative systems. The Egret architecture
includes six major subsystems, including: a server subsystem for
inter-process communication and low-level storage; a type subsystem for
building domain-specific typed hypertext nodes and links; a generic
interface subsystem implementing facilities for manipulating ETML (the
Egret analogue to HTML); an applets subsystem providing small, reusable,
Egret devices; and a metrics subsystem providing instrumentation facilities.
<P>
The following sections take a closer look at these systems, using 
state as an organizing principle.
