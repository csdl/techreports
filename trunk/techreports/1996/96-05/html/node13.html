<P>
Analyzing architectural support for the trigger dimension in a
CSCW architecture tends to illuminate its support for autonomous
software agents.  If an architecture provides any support for state
production at all, then it supports at least triggering based upon 
user action. More advanced forms of triggering require agents.
<P>
Within architectures supporting user action triggers, there is wide
variation in the spectrum of user actions that trigger state collection.
For example, the cgi script mechanism in WWW allows essentially arbitrary
actions to be carried out based upon the contents of a web form.  This
allows a single, simple user action trigger--pressing the infamous
``submit'' button--that supports the collection of any state information
present on the form.
<P>
Lotus Notes provides more support for user action triggers than the WWW.
In Notes (when using the centralized server mechanism), virtually any
change to the database can trigger an event, which can communicate
information back to that client or any other connected client. However, the
architecture of Lotus Notes does not provide explicit support for user
action triggers that do not modify the database.  For example, one client
cannot be notified in real-time whenever another client pulls down a 
specific menu, since this user action does not affect the database in 
any fashion.
<P>
GroupKit and Egret provide more comprehensive support for user action
triggers. Both GroupKit and Egret can attach state collection functions to
most user gestures, such as key presses, menu pulls, mouse clicks, and so
forth, regardless of whether the gesture modifies the central server
process. In both GroupKit and Egret, user action triggers are limited to
those user gestures occurring while the system is the active process.
<P>
There is more to architectural support for fine-grained user action
triggers (such as menu pulls or mouse drags) than simply allowing
invocation of an application-specific function when these events occur.  As
we learned with Egret, fine-grained user action triggers can produce a
great deal of state information quite quickly, with a potential for
substantially negative impact upon the system's responsiveness.
<P>
For example, in an application built using the original design of Egret, we
associated various attributes, such as the user's name and a time-stamp,
with several fine-grained user actions.  Each time we used it, the
application's performance and responsiveness would degrade terribly after
only a few days.  The problem was that the stored state information would
quickly overwhelm the actual artifact information in the database.
This situation eventually led us to a complete redesign of Egret in which
many forms of high volume, fine-grained state information could be
collected with minimal impact upon the responsiveness of the
application. (As a humorous aside, while evaluating that early application,
we discovered that over 70% of the database was occupied by time-stamps
alone! This occurred because we represented time using the Emacs <TT>
current-time-string</TT> function, which produced very space-inefficient
time-stamps such as ``Wed Mar 13 08:18:50 1996''. We solved this particular
problem with a custom date package that reduced time-stamps to a fraction
of their former size.)
<P>
To support triggers based upon anything other than user action, agents
are necessary.  For example, the Egret application AEN has an agent that
composes and delivers a ``daily newspaper'' by e-mail to the group members
each morning summarizing the changes to the document since the day
before. The e-mail also contains a customized to-do list for each member
containing, for example, which parts of the artifact were changed by some
other group member since the last time the recipient looked at them.  This
state manipulation is triggered by several factors: the time of day (an
external trigger) begins the process, and the outcome is influenced by the
structure of the artifact as well as the state information associated with
each component.
