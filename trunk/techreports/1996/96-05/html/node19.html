A discussion of the collection, representation, storage, modification, and
distribution of state information in CSCW architectures may be useful from
a purely intellectual standpoint for some, but others may desire some more
practical outcome.  Even though Egret ``scores high'' with respect to state
manipulation, one would certainly not conclude that it is the ``best'' CSCW
architecture.  Conversely, the WWW architecture exhibits extremely poor
facilities for state management, yet this architecture has produced global
changes in who uses computers and the way in which they are used.  
Other CSCW architectures have produced little more than a ripple compared
to the collaborative tidal wave of the Web.
<P>
While state does not serve to differentiate the utility of CSCW
architectures, it still has great value as a means to illuminate certain
fundamental issues and trade-offs made by any design.  We conclude by
offering two conjectures to the CSCW community for reflection and debate.
First, that ``collaboration-in-the-small'' requires fundamentally different
support at the architectural level from ``collaboration-in-the-large''.
Second, that collaborative architectures should be designed with the view
that the interface and processing requirements of autonomous software
agents are just as important than those of human users. Both of these
conjectures arise directly from consideration of state as an organizing
principle.
