<P>
The producer dimension focuses on what classes of objects in the
collaborative system have state information collected about them.
<P>
One producer of state information is the artifacts, or work
products of the collaborative system. For example, state information can
be represented about the structure of artifacts or their relationship to
each other, or the manner in which the artifact evolved to its current
state.
<P>
The individuals engaging in collaboration also produce state information,
which can model each individual's capabilities, their prior involvement in
the collaboration, or their future commitments.
<P>
The collaborative process itself can also produce state information.  For
example, some systems represent a plan for collaboration, and collect
state information concerning where in the plan the collaboration has
reached, any exceptions or problems with the plan, and so forth.
<P>
Finally, the context surrounding the use of the system can produce state
information. For example, some systems collect data on the organizational
environment in which the group works that affects the productivity and
quality of collaboration. Others collect network
statistics on message transmission latency and its effects on
collaboration.
