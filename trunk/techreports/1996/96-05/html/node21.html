<P>
A second outcome from our reflections upon the role of state is that
architectures must be designed with as much concern for the needs of
autonomous agents as for the needs of human users.  This conjecture results
from our finding that state information tends to be very expensive to
collect, manage, and distribute, and placing this computational load on
either user-level clients or the server often degrades system
responsiveness to an acceptable level.  In addition, the storage allocated
for state information can far exceed that of the artifacts themselves.
<P>
It is not enough, in our experience, to simply enable basic autonomous
interaction, such as the ability of the WWW to support spiders.  While
the WWW architecture was not designed with the needs of its agents in mind,
the current architecture of Egret reflects evolution driven as much by the
needs of its agents as its users.
<P>
For example, URN, a collaborative news reader, was built using the second
major release of Egret. It utilized an agent that woke up each night to
``read'' news articles and prepare them for the users. Unfortunately, the
high-level Egret <EM>user</EM> interface used by the agent formatted each
article for human readability, even though the agent treated it as simple
ASCII text. The formatting, unfortunately, slowed the agent down by a
factor of 10 to 100, and placed an artificially low upper limit on the
number of articles that a single agent could process in a night.  This
architectural flaw forced the designer of the agent to choose between using
a low-level system interface and reprogramming a great deal of higher level
functionality, or using the high-level user interface and sacrificing time
to unnecessary processing. The flaw occurred because we had neglected to
take into account the differences between agents and users.
<P>
Eliciting requirements from software agents is a poorly understood area of
systems design.  We have, nevertheless, found the following heuristics to
be useful during application design. We invite the CSCW community to 
contribute additional insights into requirements for agent-based systems:
<P>
<UL><LI> <EM>Agents should be able to do virtually anything a user is
  expected to do.</EM>
<P>
  If the CSCW application is primarily textual, does it provide an
  interface to allow an agent to contribute new text?  If the application
  is primarily graphical, is an interface provided that allows an agent to
  draw?  In other words, a CSCW architecture should  make as few <EM>a
  priori</EM> assumptions as possible about which behaviors can only be
  provided by humans.  Agents can be surprisingly capable, if they are
  provided with an opportunity.<LI> <EM>The agent and user interfaces, if different, should be based
  upon a common, software/wetware-independent substrate.</EM>
<P>
  Although agents should be able to do anything users do, they might do
  it in a slightly different way. For example, most software agents
  cannot physically move a mouse, so an agent that contributes to a
  drawing must be provided with an interface that allows it to create
  graphical elements on the screen.  For basic software engineering reasons, 
  these interfaces should merge as quickly as possible in the architecture.<LI> <EM>Even though agents can mimic humans, don't disregard their
  special properties.</EM>
<P>
  As the example of agent-based processing in URN illustrates, the system
  may need to support behaviors from agents that might never be required
  for a system whose users are always humans. When designing interfaces and
  subsystems, after ensuring that they are both human and agent accessible,
  consider whether a supplemental interface designed purely around the 
  agent might not provide useful additional capabilities.
