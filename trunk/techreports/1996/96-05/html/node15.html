In this paper, a ``session'' is the contiguous period of time that
a user is ``connected'' to a system. A ``conference'' is the period of time
during which a group of interacting users are connected simultaneously.
Interestingly, CSCW architectures interpret sessions and conferences quite
differently, which affects their support for state persistence.
<P>
In the WWW architecture, a session is best viewed as a single http request,
which is typically less than a second long. (Server push/client pull
mechanisms enable much longer sessions, of course.) This interpretation of
a session as a single http request aligns well with the intent of the
designers of the WWW architecture, who state:
<P>
<EM>
[HTTP] is stateless... The stateless model is efficient when a link
from one object may lead equally well to an object stored on the same
server, or to another distant object.  [A URI] should always refer
to the ``same'' object. This also makes a stateless protocol appropriate,
as it returns results based on the URI that are irrelevant of any previous
operations performed by the client. [<A HREF="node24.html#BernersLee94">2</A>]
</EM>
<P>
More colloquially speaking, the WWW architecture has no explicit
representation of users who ``visit'' a single web site and ``surf''
through the artifacts provided by its server over the course of minutes or hours.
Similarly, the WWW architecture does not represent or support conferences.
Given the clear intents of the WWW designers with respect to state (and its
lack thereof), and the paucity of support for sessions and conferences,
there is obviously no support for persistent state across sessions or
conferences.
<P>
In the replicated database version of Lotus Notes, a session
logically consists of the period of contiguous time during which the user
is connected to the Notes database.  Any state changes stored in
this database will persist until the next session. However, the fact
that databases are locally replicated eliminates the possibility of 
conferences, and also means that state information collected on one 
database from one user is not available to another user until 
synchronization occurs.  The central server database version of Notes
does support sessions, conferences, and persistent state across 
sessions and conferences.
<P>
Computer-based conferencing is the raison d'&#234;tre of GroupKit, so the
architecture naturally includes well-defined and explicit representations
and support for both sessions and conferences.  However, users, artifacts,
sessions, and conferences are ephemeral in GroupKit: nothing persists
beyond or between conferences. ``The concept of users exists only within
the current real-time conference session.  No information is held about
past users in a conference, nor any notion of a long term community
[<A HREF="node24.html#Roseman95a">8</A>].''
<P>
The Egret architecture provides both representations and support for
sessions, and support (such as chat tools) but no explicit representations
for conferences of simultaneously connected, interacting users.  State
persists across sessions and conferences.
<P>
In our experience, support for state manipulation within and between
sessions and conferences involves the following four requirements:
<P>
<UL><LI> Users need to be aware of and react to the state of other users
  within a session and/or conference.<LI>  Users joining a conference need to get ``caught up'' to other
  users.  (In other words, the state of the conference needs to be shared
  and synchronized between all participating users.)<LI>  Users need to be able to ``pick up where they left off last time.''
  In other words, they need to be able to recover their final state from
  the last session or conference.<LI>  Users need to be aware of and react to the state changes of other
  users that occurred since their last session and/or conference.
<P>
</UL>
<P>
The WWW architecture supports none of these requirements; GroupKit supports
the first two; Lotus Notes and Egret support all four.  The last
requirement, informing users of what happened of interest while they were
absent, can be particularly problematic to support in an efficient and
responsive fashion.  In Egret, some of our architectural support for agents
came specifically from the fourth requirement, because it is much simpler to satisfy with
an agent that remains continuously connected and serves as a kind of
``virtual participant'' in all sessions and conferences. Figure
<A HREF="node15.html#figsnoopy">1</A> illustrates one agent-based mechanism in Egret that maintains
state information within and between sessions.
