<P>
Some very useful CSCW architectures provide little explicit support for
either production or consumption of explicit state information.  The WWW is
an excellent example.  At the architectural level, the WWW is
a mechanism allowing users to make documents that are globally
accessible via servers, and that may contain embedded links to other
documents. At this level, there is no explicit support for collection or
manipulation of state information.  The WWW architecture does not build in
mechanisms, for example, to represent which people are currently using a
document, which documents have been created by a particular user, why a
document is being manipulated by a user, and so forth.  The cgi script
mechanism does enable primitive support for state production and
consumption, since it creates a kind of ``trap door'' in the architecture
for incorporation of external storage, retrieval, and information 
processing mechanisms.
<P>
The paucity of WWW mechanisms for state production and consumption should
not be construed as a bug, but rather as a feature. By eliminating all
requirements for state representation and manipulation, explosive growth of
WWW servers, documents, and use can occur without a corresponding explosion
in state information processing.  The WWW represents a canonical form of
``collaboration-in-the-large'', and has enabled an unprecedented number of
people of divergent backgrounds and interests to collaborate 
together.
<P>
Lotus Notes and GroupKit both provide greater support for production and
consumption of state information.  The Lotus Notes architecture
provides a document repository that supports wide-area distribution in
the presence of potentially unreliable and/or intermittent network
connections.  It also provides mechanisms to collect basic forms of
state information about the artifacts under development, the people
involved in collaboration, and the process of collaboration itself.
Architecturally, however, Lotus Notes does not distinguish between state
information and the artifacts of collaboration.
<P>
In GroupKit, there is such a distinction: there is the shared artifact
under construction (such as an illustration in a shared white board) as well
as a separate, shared data structure called an ``environment'' that allows
an explicit and independent representation of state information.
<P>
Egret provides extensive architectural support for production and
consumption of state information concerning artifacts, individuals,
process, and the external environment.  Egret makes an architectural
distinction between the artifacts involved in collaboration and state
information by partitioning storage into separate areas. Some of these
areas for designed for ``user-level'' storage and manipulation of
artifacts, while other areas are designed for management of state
information.  Each of these latter areas differ along the dimensions of
representation, persistence, location, distribution, and time.
