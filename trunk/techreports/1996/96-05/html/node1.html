Over the past five years, the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory
at the University of Hawaii has designed, implemented, and evaluated a
variety of CSCW systems.  This work includes CLARE, a collaborative
learning environment [<A HREF="node24.html#csdl9321">10</A>]; CSRS, a collaborative software
review environment [<A HREF="node24.html#csdl9207">6</A>]; AEN, a collaborative hypertext
authoring environment [<A HREF="node24.html#csdl9420">5</A>], HI-TIME, a collaborative system
for telecommunications policy planning; Shemacs, a collaborative editor
[<A HREF="node24.html#csdl9516">7</A>]; and Flashmail, a collaborative messaging facility.  All
of these environments were built using Egret [<A HREF="node24.html#csdl9201">4</A>], an architecture
and development environment for CSCW applications.
<P>
As we built these systems, we accumulated general requirements for
collaboration from these various domains that we pushed downward into the
framework.  Egret's current design and implementation results from three
complete redesigns and over a hundred separate releases during its five
years of active development to date.  The current architecture of Egret
embodies much of what we find to be essential for computer-mediated
collaboration across our chosen application domains.
<P>
Although the specifics differ, we find that there are general classes of
questions that our collaborative applications must often answer.  For
example: Who are the other users?  What artifacts are involved in this
collaborative activity?  What has changed since yesterday?  What is
important for me to focus on right now?  Who should be informed about this
change?  Is the information in the system up to date?  Does user X know
about event Y yet? What is user Z doing right now?  We also find that the
usability of our applications often depends upon the efficiency with which
it answers one or more of these types of questions, although which types of
questions are time-critical and their specific form vary from application
to application.
<P>
In general, answering these questions requires an application to collect,
represent, store, modify, analyze, and distribute state information.  In
fact, Egret's development history can be profitably viewed as an
exploration of the architectural services required for a CSCW application
to manage state information appropriately.  In Egret, state is an
organizing principle.
<P>
This paper presents state as an organizing principle for CSCW
architectures, and illustrates this perspective using four exemplary
systems: the World Wide Web, GroupKit, Lotus Notes and Egret.  The next
section presents a framework to aid in understanding the role of state in
CSCW architectures.  Subsequent sections apply this framework to the chosen
architectures. The paper concludes with two conjectures supported
by this viewpoint.  First, that the requirements for architectures
supporting ``collaboration-in-the-small'', such as Egret, are fundamentally
different from those supporting ``collaboration-in-the-large'', such as
WWW. Thus, a single system can provide effective support for one but not
both of these extremes.  Second, that collaborative architectures must
support autonomous agents as ``first class'' users if both flexible and
efficient support for state management is desired.
