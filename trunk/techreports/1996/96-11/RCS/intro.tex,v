\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\subsection{Motivation}

\subsection{Theses}
\begin{enumerate}
\item {An appropriately designed computer-mediated formal technical review
    environment will be adopted in an industrial environment and will yield
    substantial improvements in measures of review efficiency and
    effectiveness without introducing metrics dysfunction.}

\item {The AFTR technology transfer method's instrumentation will provide valuable
    insights into the strengths and weaknesses of this technology transfer
    method.}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hypotheses}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[H1.1:]{There will be observable differences in review
effectiveness between the manual process and the automated process.}
\item[H1.2:]{There will be a observable difference in cost between
the manual FTR process and the automated FTR process.}
\item[H1.3:]{The organization will adopt AFTR as their FTR tool.}
\item[H1.4:]{The participants will prefer to use the automated FTR
process over the manual FTR process.}
\item[H2.1:]{Analysis of the process defects will lead to Process
Improvement Proposals (PIPs).}
\item[H2.2:]{Process Improvement Proposals (PIPs) from the method will
provide insight to improving the technology transfer method.}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item{How do we develop a system that measures FTR without introducing
dysfunction?}
\item{Does a system that measures FTR without introducing dysfunction,
provide management with the answers they want?}
\item{Will a FTR system without dysfunction be adopted?}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Definition of Improvement:}
\begin{itemize}
\item{less effort}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{overall time spent in TekInspect}
  \item{individuals spend less time doing AFTR than TekInspect}
  \item{less rework time per defect}
  \item{reduces scribe's work}
  \item{makes group meetings more effective}
  \end{itemize}
\item{more defects found}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{allows reviewers to focus on review not process}
  \item{more severe errors than minor}
  \item{defects per hour goes up}
  \end{itemize}
\item{participants like new automated system}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{participants feelings toward FTR improves}
  \item{participants want to have their work reviewed}
  \item{Esprit de corps}
  \item{team building}
  \end{itemize}
\item{more groups use FTR with AFTR than with out}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{number of groups using TekInspect vs AFTR}
  \item{more groups asking to use AFTR}
  \end{itemize}
\item{Management sees benefits of FTR from AFTR}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item{cost savings}
  \item{more predictability for reviews using AFTR}
  \item{reduced time for projects using AFTR}
  \item{Management want teams to use AFTR}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This proposal is organized as following: Section \ref{sec:related} relates
the current research to the broader context of existing work.  Section
\ref{sec:method} introduces our method for introducing automated FTR into
an organization.  Section \ref{sec:manual} describes the manual FTR method
being used.  Section \ref{sec:AFTR} depicts the main design features and
architecture of AFTR.  Section \ref{sec:experiment} outlines the
experimental case study I plan to conduct to evaluate AFTR.  Finally,
Section \ref{sec:plan} presents the current research plan.

The benefit of introducing a Formal Technical Review method to the software
engineering process is well documented.  However the benefits of automating
the Formal Technical Review method are not well understood.  The thesis of
this research is that AFTR will improve the effectiveness of Formal
Technical Review over the manual process.

I will measure effectiveness in several ways, number of defects found, time
spent conducting the review, feeling toward the process by the
participants, rework time, total review effort and individual review effort.
