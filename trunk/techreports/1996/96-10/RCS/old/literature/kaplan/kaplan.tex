Title: Secrets of Software Quality
Authors: Craig Kaplan, Ralph Clark, Victor Tang
BibCard reference: Kaplan95

Summary:

Discusses forty innovations put into use by a lab at IBM resulting in
fewer defects, lower service costs, increased customer satisfaction, and
increased productivity and revenue. 


Notes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Software quality improvement requires a long term commitment. (3) 
\item Case study from IBM showing cost of defect prevention via inspection
versus cost of no inspections might be useful (pg 4-5)
\item One dollar invested in quality improvement at the design or
requirements stage should yield 30 to 50 dollars in cost savings down the
road (reference to Weekley and Markus article in Software Engineering
Productivity Handbook)
\item Understanding the development process provides a basis for deciding
which tools should have maximum impact on quality. (6)
\item To get sustainable quality progress you must focus on three areas -
technology, process, and leadership. (6)
\end{enumerate}
