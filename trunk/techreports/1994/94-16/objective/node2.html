This research is concerned with how people collaboratively author and
learn.  More specifically, it is concerned with how to design and implement
a hypertext system to support collaborative authoring and learning. It will
provide information on the following questions:<OL><LI>What breakdowns occur in collaborative authoring and learning?
  <OL>  <LI>What types of breakdowns are due to moving collaboration on line?
  <LI>What types of breakdowns are due to our collaborative methods?
  </OL> 
<LI>How does hypertext support collaborative learning?
  <OL>  <LI>What kinds of hypertext structure are necessary for collaborative learning?
  <LI>What additional tools are needed for collaborative learning?
  </OL> 
<LI>How do authors create hypertext documents?
  <OL>  <LI>What kinds of hypertext structure are necessary for collaborative authoring?
  <LI>What additional tools are needed for collaborative authoring?
  </OL> 
<LI>What are the reading patterns of hypertext users?
<LI>What tools help the readers navigate in the hypertext document?
</OL>
<P>
We are investigating these issues through the design, implementation, and
evaluation of AEN <A NAME=tex2html1 HREF="footnode.html#28"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs//foot_motif.gif"></A>, a hypertext collaborative authoring and learning tool.
<P>
These issues are becoming more and more important each day.  The use of
hypertext as a structuring mechanism for richly interdependent information
is becoming more widespread, and finds applicability in many areas of
software engineering and other fields.
<P>
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.  Section
<A HREF="node3.html#seccollaborativel">2</A> introduces collaborative learning and authoring
in AEN. Section <A HREF="node17.html#secevaluation">3</A> is a discussion of how we are going to
answer the issues raised above.  Section <A HREF="node21.html#secrelatedwork">4</A> examines
other collaborative learning and authoring systems and how they compare to
AEN. Section <A HREF="node22.html#secfuture">5</A> discusses future directions for AEN.
