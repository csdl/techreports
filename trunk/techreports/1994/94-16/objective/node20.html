The data collected will consist of metrics data, user suggestions, bug
reports and user questionnaires.  Let's revisit the central questions of
this research objective, and discuss how this data can be used to assess
them.
<OL><LI><em>What breakdowns occur in collaborative authoring and learning?</em>
<P>
  By looking at the questionnaires we can see how the users
  feel about AEN as a collaborative learning and authoring tool.  The
  user's input will help us understand which tools provided by AEN were
  not well received.  The Bug reports and Suggestions will also tell us
  what problems the users had using AEN.  We can also look at
  their answers to the exercises.  As the experiment progresses we can
  gauge the knowledge learned by the users. We will can also look at their projects and judge how much they have
  learned.  By looking at the metrics we will see what
  patterns the users used and what patterns lead to difficulties.
<P>
  <OL>  <LI><em>What types of breakdowns are due to moving collaboration on
    line?</em>
<P>
  The comments raised in class will help us find out if face to face
  meetings are required for collaboration.  The questionnaire will also ask
  about how much time was spent in face to face meetings outside the
  context of the class.  By looking at the bug reports and the suggestions
  we can get an idea what the users liked and what the users did not like
  about AEN.  This should give us an idea of what problems the users had in
  collaborating on line.
<LI><em>What types of breakdowns are due to our collaborative methods?</em>
<P>
  The user questionnaires and suggestions made by the users will help us
  determine if our methods are correct for this group of students.  The
  suggestions will tell us what features the users want to have.  The
  questionnaires will tell us which features AEN had were not helpful or were
  misleading.
</OL> 
<LI><em>How does hypertext support collaborative learning?</em>
<P>
  The metrics will help us find out what types of nodes are used.  The
  metrics will also tell us how the users answered ``collaborative''
  assignments.  We can tell how a group answered the question.
  Some of the possible ways they could collaboratively solve problems
  are:<UL><LI>Alternatively Edit: They could create a solution and then take turns
  editing the solution.
<LI>Proof Read: They could create a solution and then proof read the
  solution
<LI>Discuss and Solve: They could create a discussion tree about the
  solution then create the solution based upon the discussion
<LI>Combination of the above methods
</UL>
<OL><LI><em>What kinds of hypertext structure are necessary for collaborative
  learning?</em>
<P>
  By looking at the metrics and the types of nodes created we can see how
  the users collaborated.  Did they create discussions through comments
  or did they create separate collaborative documents?
<P>
<LI><em>What additional tools are needed for collaborative learning?</em>
<P>
  The questionnaire and suggestions will give us an idea of how much the
  other tools like partyline and snoopy were used to aid collaboration.
  The user's suggestions will give us a good idea of what tools are missing
  or are not necessary in AEN.  The classifications of the suggestions
  should help us determine how good AEN's paradigm is.
</OL> 
<LI><em>How do authors create hypertext documents?</em>
<P>
  The metrics data will tells us how new nodes were created and when the
  access privileges were changed to allow the other users to read the
  nodes.  We should be able to determine general strategies for authoring
  hypertext document.  Some possible strategies are:<UL><LI>Build content then structure: The author creates the contents of the
  nodes in a single node then creates the separate nodes in the network and
  cuts and pastes the data into them.
<LI>Build structure then fill content: The author could ``outline'' the
  document by creating the structure of the nodes and then fill in their
  contents.
<LI>Iterative: The author could start filling the contents of a node
  then build another node when the contents dictate a new node and then
  start filling the contents of the new node.  This method repeats
  filling content until new structure is called for then continuing with
  content.</UL>  The user's suggestions will also give us insight
  into what tools they want to aid in the authoring process.
<P>
  <OL>  <LI><em>What kinds of hypertext structure are necessary for
    collaborative authoring?</em>  The metrics will tell us how authors
    collaboratively created a document.  Did they take turns editing the
    document or did they use the proof reading method?
<P>
  <LI><em>What additional tools are needed for collaborative
    authoring?</em>
<P>
    The metrics data will tell us which tools were used the most.  The
    user questionnaires will tell us which tools the author's liked the
    most.  The user's suggestions will show us what tools we forgot to
    include in AEN's design. The metrics and questionnaires should
    correlate well.  If they do then we can conclude that those tools
    are helpful in authoring a hypertext document.
<P>
  </OL> 
<LI><em>What are the reading patterns of hypertext users?</em>
<P>
  The metrics data will tell us exactly in what order the users read the
  individual nodes in the hypertext document.  We will be able to
  generate a ``map'' of activity for each user.  We should be able to
  determine general patterns for the users.  Some general patterns might
  be,
<P>
  <UL>  <LI>Linear: The user generally reads through the document once from
    one node to the next.
<P>
  <LI>Hunt and peck: The user jumps from one node to another that is
    not connected by a link.
<P>
  <LI>Combination: The user might hunt and peck until a particular area
    of the hypertext network is found then read linearly.
  </UL>
<P>
<LI><em>What tools help the readers navigate in the hypertext document?</em>
<P>
  The metrics data will tell us which tools were used the most.  The user
  questionnaires will tell us which tools the user's liked the most.  The
  user's suggestions will tell us what tools we forgot to include in
  AEN's design.  The metrics and questionnaire should correlate well.  If
  they do then we can conclude that those tools are helpful in navigating
  in a hypertext document.
