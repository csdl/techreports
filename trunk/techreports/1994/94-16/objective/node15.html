For collaborative learning, the hypertext document represents the textbook
for the class and the instructor's lectures. When students have questions
about the textbook or ``lectures'' they can ask their questions by
annotating the text.  The instructor or other students can answer
the questions by making annotations on the original question.  This way
``in-class discussions'' can take place about different topics.  By using the
access control mechanism students or instructors can decide who gets to
read the node and who can participate in the discussions.  This allows
groups to collaborate on a question or project easily.  When the group is
ready they can allow the rest of the class to view their answer or project.
To find out if anything has changed on their project the students can use
the node lists to see what nodes have changed.  This way they will waste
less of their time searching for new information.
<P>
The Snoopy and Partyline features expand AEN's textbook by providing
synchronous communications. Student can get together in AEN and discuss the
concepts presented in the text.  They can work together on solving the
quizzes or projects presented in AEN.  Snoopy and Partyline allow the
instructor could hold office hours by being ``present'' in AEN at given
times.  The students can ask the instructor questions and receive
answers immediately.  The instructor could have a group discussion with all
the students present in AEN. If anyone decides that they want to save the
discussion they can create a node in the hypertext document and paste the
conversation into it.  This way a permanent record of what was said can
be kept.
<P>
The combination of hypertext document and synchronous communications allows
the students to learn in many ways.  They can learn by exploring the text,
asking questions, answering questions raised by their fellow students,
building their own hypertext sections or by answering the exams or quizzes
added by the instructor.  As the students learn the hypertext document
will be evolving.  The instructor will change the text to answer the
questions raised by the students.  The students will be creating
sub-documents in the hypertext document to explore the subject.
