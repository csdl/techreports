\section{Transformation rules (smoothening, scales and shifts).} \label{scales_and_shifts}
As we seen, the Euclidean distance is efficient and easily computable but it doesn't capture similar time-series in the presence of noise, scales or shifts. Many research was done to overcome this issue. As mentioned before, in \cite{citeulike:3815880} authors introduced scale and the shift shape-persieving transformations which applied before measuring the similarity with Euclidean distance, their proposed definition of similar time-series based on the similarity transformation $T_{a,b}$ where $a$ is the scaling coefficient and $b$ is the shift coefficient. This ``similarity transformation $T_{a,b}$'' is a mapping of each of the $x_{i} \in X$ into $x_{i}\acute{} = a*x_{i}+b$ and if this transformation can be found for two time-series $X$ and $Y$ such that $X=T_{a,b}(Y)$ time-series $X$ and $Y$ are similar.

Agrawal et al. \cite{citeulike:3816327} proposed a similar method of aligning of time-series but allowing any arbitrary segment of the query time-series to be scaled and stretched by any suitable amount and adding the ability of deletion of any non-matching segment (this work in fact seems to be the one of the first proposing LCS application to time-series similarity, see \ref{lcs}). Also they introduced an $\epsilon$ envelope around the template sequence which aimed to deal with noise on the query time-series. The figure  \ref{fig:transform} shows principles of such a method walking from the raw time series through discussed transformations.

   \label{fig:transform}
\end{figure} 

Since the Euclidean distance is calculated only after transformations applied, it is unable to capture the cost and complexity of the transformations required and does not reflect the true similarity. If the different cost assigned to the each transformation performed \cite{citeulike:3731711}, than the integral of all effective costs will measure the true similarity between time-series.
