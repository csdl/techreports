\section{Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) } \label{lcs}
Another widely used metrics in the time-series similarity is the Longest Common Subsequence or LCS. LCS could be seen as the successor of the application of the Euclidean distance, DTW or scales and shifts \cite{citeulike:3816327} since it might be essentially based on any of these. 

The idea of LCS is explained in the classical Computer Science manuscript \cite{citeulike:180287} (CLR) for the string matches with use of the Dynamic Programming and have the complexity of $O(NM)$. Yazdani and Ozsoyoglu designed their algorithm by following the CLR with better complexity $O(N+M)$ specifically for image sequences \cite{citeulike:4367061}, but they essentially describing it as the algorithm of matching of real-valued sequences and specifically pointed application to time-series and decomposed time-series represented by the set of features like Fourier coefficients, etc. The Figure \ref{fig:lcs} taken from the article explains the approach taken: each of the images is approximated by the set of the specific to the domain real-values, and if $R$ and $S$ match than $FR$ and $FS$ match anlagously, if $FR$ and $FS$ are similar than $R$ and $S$ are similar.

Yazdani and Ozsoyoglu starting with two sequences $X$ and $Y$ with lengths $N$ and $M$ respectively and building the vector data structure $Cvect$ of the size of the shorter one such that $Cvect[i]$ is the index of the element in $Y$ which matches with $i$th element of $X$. By letting $C[i,j]$ to be the length of the longest common subsequence of $X_{i}$ and $Y_{i}$ they define it as 

\begin{equation}
 C[i,j] = 
 \begin{cases} 
  0 \; \text{if } i=0 \; \text{or} \; j=0 \\
  C[i-1,j-1]+1 \; \text{if } i,j>0 \; \text{and } x_{i} \; \text{matches } y_{i} \\
  \max{C[i,j-1], \;C[i-1,j]} \; \text{otherwise}
 \end{cases}
\label{eq:lcs}
\end{equation}

By modifying the range of matching in the definition \ref{eq:lcs} to the specific (relaxed) bounds they achieved a better performance being able to improve the sensitivity of the method. 

Agrawal et al. \cite{citeulike:3816327}, as mentioned before, introduced LCS-based concept of similarity with local scaling measuring the similarity based on the amount of non-overlapping time-ordered pairs of subsequences that are similar instead of individual points as displayed at the \ref{fig:agrawal_lcs};
