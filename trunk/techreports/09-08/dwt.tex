\section{Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)}
In \cite{citeulike:3734066} Popivanov and Miller discussing the time-series similarity search using wavelets-based dimensionality reduction. In this work they are exploring further away from previously used Haar wavelets \cite{citeulike:4384535} and showing that some of the wavelets outperform not only Haar wavelets but best-known non-wavelet approaches for the time-series similarity up to date.
