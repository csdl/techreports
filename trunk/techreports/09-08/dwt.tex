\section{Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) decomposition}
In \cite{citeulike:3734066} Popivanov and Miller discussing the time-series similarity search using wavelets-based dimensionality reduction. In this work they are exploring further away from previously used Haar wavelets \cite{citeulike:4384535} and showing that some of the wavelets outperform not only Haar wavelets but also the best-known non-wavelet approaches for the time-series similarity up to date (DFT, DCT, SVD etc.). Their approach for time series approximation benefits from such a wavelet-transform properties as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Compact support: there are flavors of the wavelet transform such that a basis function is non-zero only at the finite interval, which allows wavelet approximation to capture local time-series features as opposite to DFT based approach which is capturing only global features.}
	\item{Efficiency: while FFT complexity is $O(n \log{n}$, wavelet transform is linear to the sixa of the data and is real-to-real transform.}
	\item{Sensetivity: wavelet transform allows fine tuning of the approximation by selecting the different scales, corresponding to basis functions of different length where the DFT gives.}
\end{itemize}

The wavelet is a function, $\psi_{j,k}$ defined on $\mathbb{R}$ with shift $k$ and dyadic dilation (a product of power of $2$, referred as stretching). The set of functions defined as
\begin{equation}
\psi_{j,k} = 2^{j/2} \psi \left( 2^{j}t - k \right)  
\label{eq:wavelet}
\end{equation} 
for $j, k \in \mathbb{Z}$ form a complete orthonormal system over $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$ and can be used to define any signal $f \in L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$ uniquely by the following series: 
\begin{equation}
f = \sum_{j, k \in \mathbb{Z}} \left\langle f, \psi_{j,k} \right\rangle  \psi_{j,k}, \\
\text{where} \left\langle f,g \right\rangle = \int_{\mathbb{R}} f g \: dx \; \text{, the inner product}
\label{eq:wavelet_series}
\end{equation} 
The function $\psi_{j,k}$ is the ``basis function'' of the wavelet (mother wavelet function) and essentially wavelet can use an infinite family of basis functions as opposite to Fourier transform which uses only exponential function.

It has been proven \cite{citeulike:499150} that the energy of the wavelet features lies between two non-negative bounds:
\begin{equation}
A \left\| X \right\|^{2} \leq \left\| x \right\|^{2} \leq B \left\| X \right\|^{2}
\label{eq:dwt_bounds}
\end{equation}
where $A$ and $B$ are non-negative constants, $x$ is the signal and $X$ it's wavelet transform $X=T(x)$. 

For the $\epsilon$-radius range query and equation \ref{eq:dwt_bounds} we have the following inequality:
\begin{equation}
A \left\| X-Q \right\|^{2} \leq \left\| x-q \right\|^{2} < \epsilon^{2} 
\label{eq:}
\end{equation}
which provides us with the confidence of no false-dismissals (lower bounding property).

Popivanov \& Miller along with Chan \& Fu \cite{citeulike:4384535} proved the superiority of DWT over Fourier transform, SVD and PAA methods in both, the speed of index building and the precision of the range-query processing while using the same F-index and $R^{*}$-tree as in the previous time-series similarity work.
