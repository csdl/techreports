\section{Lower Bounding}
The time-series similarity matching problem was first examined by Agrawal et al \cite{citeulike:3973409} and while employing DFT and proposing F-index they were relying on the use of the Parseval's theorem which guaranteed that the distance between frequiencies in the time domaine is the same as in the frequency domain \ref{eq:dft_similarity}. By using only first $f$ coefficients of DFT they were introducing false hits into F-Index but ensured that there are no false-dismissals. Following work by Faloutsos et al \cite{citeulike:825581} introduced Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs) and generalized the F-index use for the subsequence matching. Both approaches in order to guarantee that there is no fals-dismissals for a transform $T$ the distance measure in the feature space must must satisfy a ``contractive property'' or lower-bounding condition:
\begin{equation}
D_{feature}(T(x),T(y)) \; \leq \; D(x,y) 
\label{eq:bounding}
\end{equation}
where $D$ is the distance and $x$ and $y$ are the time-series.
