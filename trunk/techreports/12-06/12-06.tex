% - below the list of authors follows a list of addresses

% - each address consists of the affiliation followed by the email addresses of the

\begin{abstract}
The accelerating world-wide growth in demand for energy has led to the conceptualization
of a ``smart grid'', where a variety of decentralized, intermittent, renewable energy
sources (for example, wind, solar, and wave) would provide most or all of the power
required by small-scale ``micro-grids'' servicing hundreds to thousands of consumers. Such
a smart grid will require consumers to transition from passive to active participation in
order to optimize the efficiency and effectiveness of the grid's electrical capabilities. 
This paper presents a software stack comprised of two open source software systems,
Makahiki and WattDepot, which together are designed to engage consumers in energy issues
through a combination of education, real-time feedback, incentives, and game mechanics. We
detail the novel features of Makahiki and WattDepot, along with our initial experiences using
them to implement an energy challenge called the Kukui Cup.
