and often following undocumented development process \cite{citeulike:10377366}, natural human 
activity cycles are often discarded and development and release cycles are significantly altered.
Thus, the only feasible way to discover an open-source software process is to analyze 
its artifacts trails such as SCM logs, bug and issue tracking systems and 
mailing lists archives. However, the complexity of this data and the precision 
of the process recall impose a great challenge for researchers.

Previously it was found that software development, as many other human activities,
could be successfully partitioned by the time of the day reflecting our lifestyle and habits
\cite{citeulike:10396459} \cite{citeulike:10392305}. However, external constraints, 
such as employment and management constraints \cite{citeulike:6095797} and
software release cycle \cite{citeulike:2739216},  have been found altering 
natural activity patterns significantly.
