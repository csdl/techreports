\begin{abstract}  % 150 words
A plan for an advanced dorm energy competition is described, with the goal of
investigating the relationship among energy literacy, sustained energy
conservation, and information technology support of behavior change. Two
generalized open source systems have been implemented: WattDepot and Makahiki.
WattDepot provides enterprise-level collection, storage, analysis, and
visualization of energy data. Makahiki is a framework of information technology
to support dorm energy competitions of varying degrees of complexity,
including a personalized homepage where participants can complete tasks
designed to increase energy literacy that can be verified by competition
administrators. The technology and approach will be evaluated in a dorm energy
competition to take place in the Fall of 2010, with hundreds of University
freshmen. The energy use of each pair of dormitory floors will be metered in
near-realtime, and the energy literacy of participants will be assessed before
and after the competition.
