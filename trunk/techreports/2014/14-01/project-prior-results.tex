\section{Results from prior NSF support}

P. Johnson, {\em Human centered information integration for the Smart Grid}, NSF Grant IIS-1017126, 8/15/10 to 7/31/14, \$413,467. The objective of this research is to design information technology and associated experimental methods to help understand what information, provided in what ways and at what times, enables consumers to make positive, sustained changes to their energy consumption behaviors. 

{\em Intellectual Merit:} The research provided novel insight into: the inadequacy of baseline data for energy competition research, the design of experimental studies for assessing energy behaviors, the design of energy competitions incorporating educational activities. 

{\em Broader Impacts:} The broader impacts of this research include: the creation and distribution of two open source systems, WattDepot and Makahiki, that can be used for collection and analysis of energy data and the design and implementation of sustainability games; the publication of data regarding the impact of energy
education and gamification techniques on energy literacy and behavior; the training of approximately 9 undergraduate students, 3 M.S. students, and 3 Ph.D. students in research techniques, sustainability concepts, and software design and development.

Selected publications include:
  \cite{csdl2-10-05,csdl2-10-07,csdl2-10-08,csdl2-11-02,csdl2-11-03,csdl2-12-06,csdl2-11-07, csdl2-12-12,csdl2-13-10,csdl2-13-05,csdl2-13-03}. Research products are available at the Kukui Cup site \cite{kukuicup}, the WattDepot site \cite{wattdepot}, and the Makahiki site \cite{makahiki}.

% \item A. Kuh, {\em Incremental and Distributed Learning in Nonstationary
%     Environments with Applications to Wind Forecasting}, NSF Grant ECCS-098344,
%   9/01/09 - 8/31/13, \$150,251.  The objective of this research is to
%   design novel nonlinear kernel online and distributed learning algorithms
%   for applications including wind forecasting.   Research was also conducted
%   to model the microgrid using a factor-graph framework. 
%   Selected publications for
%   this project include \cite{kuh-etal10,kowahl-kuh,hu-etal10,hu-kuh-yang-kavcic,hu-kuh-kavcic-nakafuji,ji-wei-kuh,uddin12,kuh-isess,carland,navid}.
