Power quality issues can be caused in a variety of situations. Voltage fluctuations, frequency fluctuations, and harmonics are all power quality issues which can be caused by weather, high penetration of renewables, man-made issues, or other natural phenomena. We designed a software framework which can aggregate crowdsourced distributed power quality measurements in order to study power quality issues over a dense geographic area.
