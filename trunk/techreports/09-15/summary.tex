\section*{Project Summary}
\renewcommand{\thepage} {A--\arabic{page}}

%% {\em The proposal must contain a summary of the proposed activity suitable for
%% publication, not more than one page in length. It should not be an abstract
%% of the proposal, but rather a self-contained description of the activity
%% that would result if the proposal were funded. The summary should be
%% written in the third person and include a statement of objectives and
%% methods to be employed. It must clearly address in separate statements
%% (within the one-page summary):

%% (1) the intellectual merit of the proposed activity; and

%% (2)the broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity. 

%% It should be informative to other persons working in the same or related
%% fields and, insofar as possible, understandable to a scientifically or
%% technically literate lay reader. Proposals that do not separately address
%% both merit review criteria within the one-page Project Summary will be
%% returned without review.

\noindent {\bf Overview.}  The vision of this proposal is to do something.

 The goal of this research is to do something else. 

The project will pursue this vision through a set of interdependent
objectives. 

\medskip

\noindent {\bf Intellectual Merit.}  There's a lot.

\medskip 

\noindent{\bf Broader Impacts.}  Don't get me started. 
First, this project will serve
underrepresented populations, as the University of Hawaii is an EPSCOR
state. Approximately 84\% of undergraduates at the University of Hawaii are
minorities, and the computer science students exemplify this diversity.
