This process was arduous and sometimes intimidating. I would like to thank the following people who have made this entire process a little easier.

Naturally, it starts with my advisor, Dr. Philip Johnson. A simple visit to pick up a quiz became months of development and meetings. His patience, guidance and input turned this hacker into a competent researcher. I also want to include the other members of the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory: Robert Brewer, Yongwen Xu, and Michelle Katchuck. We forged ahead in this exciting new field of serious games and sustainability together. I look forward to the amazing insights each of you will have as the research continues.

Thank you to the professors and faculty members of the Department of Information and Computer Sciences. Your guidance and faith in me have helped me become who I am today. I am also truly grateful for the friends I made along the way. Whether you were graduate students or undergraduates, we made our way through and managed to have a lot of fun.

Finally, this could not have been done without the support of my parents. This would be all but impossible to achieve without their continued love and support. I am truly blessed.
