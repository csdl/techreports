\chapter{Introduction}
Because of limited oil reserves, it has become increasingly important to educate people about their energy usage.  Many scientists believe that oil is a finite natural resource and that, at some point, our demand will exceed the supply\cite{peakoil}.  In order to ensure that current energy sources are still available for future generations, organizations from non-profits\cite{blueplanet} to utility providers\cite{heco} have advocated energy conservation.  Some organizations have targeted children in order to instill these habits early\cite{energyhog}.

One approach to educating the younger generation is to hold college dormitory energy competitions.  The goal of these competitions is to have the residents of the dorm reduce their energy usage.  Typically, the dorm that reduces their energy use the most at the end of the competition is declared the winner.  Other smaller prizes can be awarded for accomplishing certain goals, like reducing energy usage by 10 percent in a week.  The overall energy reduction is determined either by having someone read the meters or using ``smart meters" that are connected to the internet and can send out data.  Universities such as Duke (Eco-Olympics) and the University of Wisconsin (Energy Apocalypse) have run competitions relating to energy conservation and awareness. 

These competitions usually involve more than just reducing energy usage.  The competition organizers also include activities that relate to energy conservation and are geared toward improving energy literacy and awareness.  Examples of activities range from viewing documentaries relating to conservation to attending recycling drives.  Participation in these activities and encouraging others to do the same can also be recognized and rewarded in the context of these dorm energy competitions.

\section{The Problem}

To aid in running the competition, many of these universities used web sites to display the dormitory's current usage.  While it is easy to create a content management system to display mostly static data (i.e. one that is only updated when someone reads the meter), dormitory residents are more motivated by real-time feedback\cite{oberlin-feedback}.  However, the development of such a system can be a complicated and/or expensive process.  Providing real-time feedback not only requires special meters that can communicate with other devices, but also requires software that can process the data and display the relevant information to the user.  Because of this, many organizations have turned to companies like Lucid Design Group that can provide this software and hardware at a cost.  Peterson et al estimated that the cost for their experiment was about \textdollar5,000 for each of the two dorms, though they suggest a conservative estimate of \textdollar10,000 for each dorm.

However, Lucid Design Group's software only involves the visualization of energy data for the building or dorm as a whole.  Because of this, the software is unable to immediately provide user-related information.  For example, if a dorm resident wants to view their floor's energy usage, they must interact with the visualization to get the information that they need.  In the ideal case, the user would log in using their university credentials and then be able to immediately view their current standings.

As for energy activities, this type of information can be posted on a website.  However, organizers would also like to be able to track interest and participation in these activities so that users can be rewarded.  Users also could be more motivated to participate if they see others in their floor/dorm participating.  Adding in these functions go beyond what a standard content management system does.  Developing such a module for a competition would also take more time and/or resources.

In addition, many of the web sites for these dorm energy competitions have not kept up with the latest trends in technology.  Two trends in particular are social networks and mobile phone interfaces.  Social networks, like Facebook, are extremely popular especially among college students.  A few colleges/universities have energy competition pages or groups on Facebook.  These two things provide a place for students to discuss what is going on in the competition.  However, Facebook users also like to share what they are doing with their friends, which cannot be done with groups or pages alone.

The rise of mobile computing devices such as Android devices, iPhones, and iPod Touches have web developers designing interfaces for smaller screens.  While a normal website is viewable on an iPhone, users will have to zoom in to read sections of the site, which can be a little cumbersome.  Also, these devices may not support browser-based plugins like Adobe's Flash.  If the website only uses Flash for a few elements, then everything else will load except for those elements.  But, if the website uses Flash for their entire interface, the page may not load at all.

Thus, the current options for competition organizers are:

\begin{enumerate}
		\item Pay a company like Lucid Design Group to develop and host a custom solution.
		\item Implement a simpler and more basic solution.
		\item Develop the software in-house, which requires developers with some web development experience.
\end{enumerate}

While reviewing other dorm energy competitions, we found that few organizations went with 3.  The result is that organizers either pay for a well-designed site with real time data or create a basic, possibly hand-written, content management system where the energy data is manually retrieved and inputted into the system once a day or once a week.

\section{Makahiki}

The goal of Makahiki is to provide a complete software package for organizations that want to hold their own dorm energy competitions.  It will have the following features:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Near-real time energy data by integrating with WattDepot.
	\item Personalized user information.
	\item The ability to create and track participation in activities, commitments, and goals.
	\item Integration with social networks such as Facebook and Twitter for displaying progress and standings.
	\item A template system that allows developers the ability to create separate interfaces for mobile devices.
	\item A configurable system to meet organizer's needs.
	\item Free and open source project.
\end{enumerate}

WattDepot\cite{wattdepot} is an open source web service in development here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  Its purpose is to collect electricity data from sources and to store it.  By combining Makahiki with WattDepot, competition organizers have an automated way of tracking the energy usage for buildings.  While compatible meters still need to be purchased, the software comes at no additional cost.  WattDepot also provides data at near-real time intervals, meaning that dorm residents can immediately see the results of their actions.

While WattDepot is able to collect all of the electricity data, the data still needs to be processed and presented to users in a visually appealing way.  Through the use Google Visualizations, electricity data can be presented in a way that is easy to understand and dynamic.  Users will be able to see their past and current electricity usage and be able to compare it to other floors.  Competition standings and goal status can also be displayed to users.

While a competition is active, competition participants will want to see personalized information about how well their floor is doing in the dorm.  To accomplish this, Makahiki will have the ability to create user accounts for participants.  There, they can view personalized energy data as well as view and participate in activities, events, and/or commitments.  Users also have a public profile that they can customize, including the ability to upload a profile picture.

Because competitions involve more than just reducing energy usage, Makahiki will also have support for creating activities, commitments, and daily energy goals.  Activities can range from replacing light bulbs in a desk lamp to attending meetings by sustainability organizations.  Commitments are typically small ``pledges" that dorm residents can accept, like committing to turning off the lights in the lounge.  Goals are actions that entire dorm floors participate in.  Daily energy goals involve floor members voting on how much they plan on reducing their floor's energy and then attempting to accomplish the goal.  Competition participants can participate in these items in order to gain points.

Furthermore, Makahiki will be configurable depending on what features are needed for the competition.  For instance, some organizations may wish to enter energy data manually since they cannot afford to purchase WattDepot-compatible smart meters for each of their dorms.  Some organizations may wish to have a simple website for their competition without the added activities, commitments, and energy goals module.  These configurations are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Single page - A single page with news and charts.  The data for these charts can be either entered manually or retrieved from WattDepot.
	\item Tabbed interface - Includes sections for additional resources (i.e. links and videos) as well as energy data retrieved from WattDepot.
	\item Full Competition - Includes supplementary activities, commitments, and energy goals.  Also includes another tab for information about the competition.
\end{enumerate}

Finally, Makahiki will be open source.  This means that competition organizers can design the visual look of the application to fit their organization.  Also, advanced users can add or tweak modules in the application to fit their needs.  \autoref{feature-comparison} outlines our desired features and compares Makahiki with other dorm energy competition implementations

\section{Evaluating the Makahiki system}

The most basic step in evaluating the Makahiki system before it goes public is to conduct usability tests.  In February of 2011, we hope to have a feature-complete instance of Makahiki ready for the tests.  We will also be collecting live data from one of the dorms on campus in order to provide a more complete experience of the system.  By watching users as they navigate through the system, we hope to isolate potential usability issues ahead of an actual competition.

While usability tests can isolate potential issues for a single user, it is not as useful for determining how well the system engages the user.  We would like users to want to come back and use Makahiki and we would like them to talk to other users about it. To accomplish this, we need to get potential users to use the system together.  Thus, in addition to our usability test, we plan on evaluating the system using a focus group.  By getting potential participants to use an early version of the system, we hope to evaluate the design of the ``game'' itself.  This differs from a usability test because we want to look at the social interactions that come out of using the system.

We also want to provide an instance of Makahiki that looks similar to another dorm energy competition (for example, the Duke Eco-Olympics).  The purpose of this is to demonstrate the configuration options and how other universities can apply Makahiki to their own competition.

% The first step in evaluating the Makahiki system is to use it in our own dorm energy competition.  An initial version of Makahiki will be available for initial testing and review in the Summer of 2010.  Then, we will be holding a dorm energy competition here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in October 2010 using both Makahiki and WattDepot.  Through the use of surveys, interviews, and/or log analysis, we will gain insight into how users will use the various features of Makahiki.

\section{Thesis Research Questions}

As a result of the evaluation of Makahiki, we intend to provide insight into the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item How effective is the site in influencing the energy usage habits of users?
	\item What components of Makahiki can we improve?
	\item How well does Makahiki support the potential needs of other energy competitions?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Proposal Structure}

Chapter 2 will discuss related works, which includes other dorm energy competitions.  Chapter 3 will describe the components of the Makahiki.  Chapter 4 describes our proposed evaluation procedure.  Finally, Chapter 5 includes the conclusion and provides a timeline for the work that is to be done to complete this project.

\chapter{Related Work}
\label{relatedwork}

Ever since Harvard hosted the first Green Cup in 1990\cite{harvard-greencup}, universities all over the nation have started holding dorm energy competitions. \autoref{duke-ecoolympics} will look into Duke University's Eco-Olympics.  \autoref{oberlin-ecolympics} will look into Oberlin College's Ecolympics, which is one of the few competitions that use an interface developed by an outside company. Finally, \autoref{competition-evaluation} will do a brief comparison and evaluation of a few other dorm energy competitions and how they compare to each other.

\section{Duke University's Eco-Olympics}
\label{duke-ecoolympics}

Duke held their first Eco-Olympics\cite{duke-eco-olympics} in 2002.  The Eco-Olympics not only involves energy conservation, but water conservation and waste reduction as well.  However, energy reduction plays a significant part in the competition as it is one of the largest components of the Eco-Olympics in terms of possible points.  Each week, the organizers get meter readings from the dorms and compare the readings with the dorm's respective baseline reading in order to calculate a per-capita reading.  This baseline reading is obtained in September, so it reflects usage when students are living in the dorm.   The key thing to note is that dorms are not directly competing against each other, as dorms vary in size and have differing energy requirements.  Also, the weekly readings are to provide feedback on how residents of each dorm are doing.  Points are only awarded at the end of the competition and the dorm with the lowest per-capita reading receives the full amount of points.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/duke-ecolympics.eps}
	\caption{Duke Eco-Olympics}
\end{figure}

The other major component of the Eco-Olympics is participation in events.  Dorms are awarded points based on the percent of residents who attend each event.  The amount of points for each event may vary, but the total points is comparable to the possible number of points for energy conservation.  These events can also involve conservation-related games.  The individuals participating in these games can also win prizes, providing additional incentive for dorm residents to participate.

The web page for the Duke Eco-Olympics is very basic.  The interface is similar to most content management systems in that there is a row of tabs at the top and the content listed below.  However, there is no place for user generated content, very little energy conservation related content, and, outside of a Google calendar, very little ``Web 2.0'' design to it.  The lack of these three things give users little reason to visit the page other than to see the weekly current standings and upcoming events.

\section{Oberlin College's Ecolympics}
\label{oberlin-ecolympics}

Oberlin College in Ohio also runs dorm energy competitions.  Instead of going with manual meter readings, Oberlin has partnered with Lucid Design Group to create their Campus Resource Monitoring System\cite{oberlin-comp}.  The Campus Resource Monitoring System is active year-round and retrieves real time electricity and water usage from 26 buildings\cite{lucid-oberlin} on campus.  The system provides graphs and statistics and are presented to users in a clean and interactive way.

The first competition that used the Campus Resource Monitoring System proved to be a success.  A study conducted during the 2005 dorm energy competition found that dorms with real time feedback reduced their energy consumption by 55 percent while dorms with ``medium resolution" feedback only reduced their energy usage by 32 percent\cite{oberlin-goals}.  In total, the competition saved 68,000 kW which translated to a savings of \textdollar5,100.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{images/oberlin-crms.eps}
	\caption{Oberlin College Campus Resource Monitoring System}
\end{figure}

While Oberlin held yearly dorm energy competitions for some time, they had their first sustainability competition, called the Ecolympics, in March of 2008\cite{oberlin-history}.  The Ecolympics at Oberlin are run at about the same time as the dorm energy competition, but the two competitions are separate.  Dorms earn points for participation in events like attending environmentally themed lectures and film screenings\cite{oberlin-news}.  Depending on the event, participants can also win individual prizes.  However, participation in these events are tracked separately from the campus resource monitoring system.

\section{Competition Evaluation}
\label{competition-evaluation}

Duke University and Oberlin College both hold dorm energy competitions, but the way these two colleges implemented the competition are very different.  While Lucid Design Group's building dashboard is very clean and interactive, most universities use a similar approach to Duke.  This is understandable, since using hardware and software provided by Lucid Design Group is quite expensive.  Thus, most organizers are relegated to manually reading the meter and updating the standings and web site accordingly.  The web interface of these competitions is fairly sparse, with a simple, static layout of tabs and content.

Also, the goal of most university sustainability organizations is to improve energy awareness.  To accomplish this, many organizations have competitions where dorms earn points by participating in energy awareness events.  Usually, these competitions are held as another component of an overall competition. In Harvard's Green Cup\cite{harvard-greencup}, energy reduction is a mere 10 percent of the overall competition. The other 90 percent includes recycling and waste reduction, participation in the Harvard Sustainability Pledge, and developing ecological projects.

However, the implementations of these dorm energy competitions have not kept up with the advances of technology and the web.  First, none of the dorm energy competitions surveyed seem to have a mobile device (iPhone, iPad, Android) interface.  Simple energy competition websites like Duke's, Stanford's, and Yale's load the full version of their web site on the iPhone.  Because mobile devices have small screens, this means that a user would have to zoom in to read the content and click on links.  Furthermore, because the iPhone and iPad do not support Adobe Flash at this time, competition websites that use Flash may not load.  In a few pages, like Indiana University's Energy Challenge, most of the page still loads.  However, pages that use Flash extensively do not load on these devices at all.  \autoref{iphone-comparison} shows screen shots of Oberlin College's Campus Resource Monitoring System, Indiana University's Energy Challenge,  and Duke's Eco-Olympics as seen on an iPhone.

	\caption{Dorm energy web sites as they appear on an iPhone.}
	\label{iphone-comparison}
\end{figure}

Also, few dorm energy competitions take advantage of social networks like Facebook.  Since most college students already have an account on one or many social networks, having a presence there provides opportunities for them to share their activities.  To spread the word of their dorm energy competition, Virginia Tech has a page on Facebook for their 2010 Eco Olympics\cite{vt-facebook}.  Duke University also has yearly Facebook group pages for their Eco-Olympics\cite{duke-facebook}.  However, Facebook users like to share what they are doing and what they find interesting, and this cannot be accomplished with pages and groups alone.  Software developers have been using a framework called Facebook Connect, which is used to enable a user to post activity on a web site to Facebook.  Using this framework, users can spread their activities from the dorm energy web site to their social network of friends.  This can only expand our audience and get more people involved in energy awareness and literacy.

\autoref{feature-matrix} outlines a few dorm energy competitions and the features they have.

\chapter{Makahiki}
\label{makahiki}

\autoref{implementation} describes the implementation of the web application and its use of free and open-source tools.  \autoref{wattdepot} goes into Makahiki's integration with WattDepot to provide real-time data.  \autoref{user} talks about what happens after a user logs in and the use of personalized information.  \autoref{activity} describes the activity framework and using it as a component of the dorm energy competition.  \autoref{mobile} describes how users with mobile devices such as Android phones or iPhones can interact with Makahiki. Finally, \autoref{socialint} describes Makahiki's integration with the Facebook social network.

\section{Implementation}
\label{implementation}

The current implementation of Makahiki is built using Django and Pinax.  Django\cite{django} is an open source web development framework implemented in Python.  Websites that use Django include the Washington Post and Mahalo.com\cite{djangosites-mahalo}.  Pinax\cite{pinax} is an open source platform built on Django that provides a set of reusable modules.

There are a few reasons why we chose Django and Pinax to implement Makahiki.  First, both are free and open-source projects.  More importantly though, Django and Pinax provided us a lot of flexibility.  While we could have gone with a more popular content management system, these larger systems may not be flexible enough to support all of our needs.  Also, the process of extending such a large codebase would take additional time.  By going with Django, a general framework for creating web applications, we have the flexibility we desire.  And for the most part, we do not need to extend Django.  Instead, we just use the tools it provides to create the necessary modules for Makahiki.  Finally, Pinax provides starter implementations for different types of web applications.  For Makahiki, we started with a content management system project and gradually added some of the features in the social project.

\section{WattDepot Integration}
\label{wattdepot}

WattDepot is an open source web service that collects and stores energy usage data from meters.  The system is currently under development in the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  While instances of the service are hosted in the laboratory, organizations can choose to host their own instances.

There are several reasons why we want to support integration with WattDepot.  First, the data in WattDepot is accessible via a REST API\cite{wattdepot-rest}, meaning that external services can easily request and retrieve data from the system.  Also, WattDepot supports near-real time (sub-minute) update intervals, which is one of the reasons why competitions that use Lucid Design Group's Building Dashboard are so successful.  With these updates, we can immediately present users with their current energy usage.  Users can then run ``experiments", like seeing what happens when someone turns off their lights.  Other freely available solutions like Google PowerMeter\cite{google-powermeter} do not have this level of feedback.

Because WattDepot stores all of this data, Makahiki can retrieve current and historical data in order to provide visualizations.  Thus, competition participants can see how their usage has changed over time.  Administrators can also use this data to see if residents are completing energy reduction goals like reducing a floor's usage by 10 percent over a week.

\section{User Features}
\label{user}

Using Django's authentication framework, we also provide the ability for competition administrators and participants to log in to the website.  Instead of storing account information within Django, we chose to use a Django CAS plugin\cite{django-cas}.  With this plugin, users will be able to log in with the account provided to them by their organization (assuming that the organization hosts their own Central Authentication Service).  After users log in for the first time, they will also have the option to connect their account with Facebook using Facebook Connect.  Users will then be able to use their Facebook login to login to Makahiki.  Thus, Makahiki does not have to store any user passwords.

Once a user logs in, they will be taken to their profile.  Users will be able to add their own picture, insert their actual name, and some additional information about themselves.  Here, the user will also be able to view the latest activity for their floor.  A box that shows the user's current floor energy consumption will also be displayed as well as their current standings relative to other floors and/or dorms.

\section{Activity Framework}
\label{activity}

In addition to the energy conservation competition, we developed a framework for a separate competition based on points.  This competition requires users to participate in predefined tasks in order to earn points for their dorms and the dorm with the highest score wins.  This competition will typically be run at the same time as the dorm energy competition, as these tasks can provide competition participants with tips on how to reduce their energy usage.  The activity framework is split into two types of tasks: activities, commitments, and daily energy goals.

\subsection{Activities}

Activities are tasks that require a competition participant to perform a specific action in order to earn points.  Examples of activities include attending presentations, watching energy conservation related videos, or joining campus sustainability groups.  These activities are designed to make participants more knowledgeable and get them involved with the sustainability community.

Users who participate in activities usually require administrator approval before they can earn the points in the activity.  Administrators can either approve or reject these requests for points.  Makahiki supports three different confirmation types: question and answer, confirmation code, and image upload.

In the question and answer, the activity creator needs to come up with at least one question to ask participants.  The admin also specifies an answer to each question, which is merely used to help other administrators validate answers to questions.  When a participant requests to receive points for a question and answer activity, a random question is picked from the list of questions for that activity.  Once a participant submits their answer, it is then available for admins to review.  Activities that require participants to watch a video might require them to answer a question.  Questions can be as simple as ``What is the unit of measurement for household energy?''

A confirmation code is typically used for activities that require attendance of an event.  The admin needs to specify the number of confirmation codes to generate.  Once the admin creates the activity, they can view the list of codes generated for this activity in a printable format.  When the event occurs, competition organizers can then hand out the confirmation codes to attendees of the event who are also participating in the competition.  When a participant requests points for this activity, they are required to enter a confirmation code.  If the code is valid, it is immediately approved.  Codes cannot be used more than once.  An example where a confirmation code might be used would be ``Attend a free movie presentation of Planet Earth''.

The image upload confirmation type requires participants to upload a picture in order to verify that they have performed the activity.  When the admin creates the activity, they also specify what the content of the image should be.  After the participant performs the activity, they are asked to upload the image.  Admins can then review the image.  An activity that might require an image upload would be ``Replace an incandescent bulb with a CFL''.  The participant could then be required to take a picture of themselves holding both the CFL and the incandescent bulb.

\subsection{Commitments}

Unlike activities, where a task is completed for points, commitments are more of a ``pledge'' to perform a task over a longer period of time.  Examples of commitments include ``Turn off the lights in the bathroom when no one is using it'' or ``Make sure the lounge television is off when no one is there''.  Commitments provide an incentive for users to change their energy usage habits.

Also, unlike activities, commitments do not require administrator approval.  Because of this, there are additional constraints on commitments.  First, commitments are typically worth fewer points than activities.  Second, a user can only participate in up to five commitments, which prevents users from committing to every possible commitment.  Third, users who participate in commitments are public and displayed to fellow dorm floor residents, competition billboards, and on the web site.  Finally, participation in a commitment lasts for a week.  After this point, users can either participate in the same commitments or change to different commitments.

\subsection{Daily Energy Goals}

Competition administrators can create daily energy goals that take place over the course of the competition.  There are two phases of a daily energy goal.  First, the residents of the dorm need to vote on a percentage they wish to reduce their energy use by.  The higher the percentage, the more points they can potentially earn.  Then, once the voting is done, a goal for each floor is selected and the goal period starts.  During this goal period, the members of each floor will have to try and reduce their energy use by the goal percentage.  For each day during the goal period that the floor is successful, each member of the floor will receive points.

At this moment, most of the energy data is handled outside of Makahiki.  Thus, it is very difficult to provide automatic validation of daily energy goals at this time.  In the meantime, these goals will need to be validated using the energy information from WattDepot.  Future revisions may include tighter integration with WattDepot along with the ability to automatically validate daily energy goals.

\section{Mobile Device Support}
\label{mobile}

Portable internet-connected devices like iPhones, iPod Touches, and Android phones are extremely popular nowadays.  Makahiki has support for custom view templates, including templates for mobile devices.  A default mobile template will provide competition participants with the ability to log in and view energy data.  Users will also be able to manage their participation in activities, commitments, and goals.

There are a few reason why we chose to go with a mobile formatted web site instead of a mobile application.  First, the support of multiple devices means that we need to develop multiple versions of the application.  A mobile application for the Android needs to be ported over to the iPhone. Second, mobile applications for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches need to be approved by Apple in order to be available for users.  An application can take a while to approve and even then we may need to resubmit the application multiple times.  Finally, a Makahiki application is just a way for a user to log in and see what is going on.  It does not require special device features such as GPS.

\section{Social Network Integration}
\label{socialint}

During our investigation of other dorm energy competitions, few organizations took advantage of popular social networks such as Facebook.  By integrating with Facebook, we allow users to share their activity within Makahiki with their friends.  As a result, Makahiki's potential influence expands from the dorm into each user's social graph.  For example, a user's Facebook friends may be encouraged to follow energy conservation tips that are posted by the user.  Also, students at other universities may be interested in hosting dorm energy competitions of their own based on the comments and activity of a current participant.

\chapter {Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}

Before we run a full competition using the Makahiki framework, we would like to have a few test users evaluate the system in order to find potential issues.  One way to accomplish this is to hold a few usability tests once the system is mostly complete. \autoref{usability} will detail our usability test procedure.

\section{Usability Testing}
\label{usability}

In February of 2011, we plan on conducting usability tests with students at UH.  The site will be set up for the 2011 Kukui Cup with live energy data from at least one of the dorms.  The usability tests will isolate issues an individual user may encounter while navigating Makahiki.  We plan on having at least two ``rounds'' of usability tests so that we can implement the feedback from the first test and see how users respond to those fixes.

Each round of usability tests will involve no more than 5 potential users.  This is because we are likely to see the same behavior from multiple users, so it is not useful to involve more than 5 users at a time\cite{usability-users}.  We do plan on video taping each user as they navigate the site.  Also, we also need their UH username so that they can log in to the system.  Because of these two things, we will have consent forms on hand to inform the user about what we plan on doing with the data.

Each user will be asked to perform a set of tasks.  The very first task will be to log in and complete the initial login wizard, which guides the user through our terms and conditions as well as setting up their profile.  After this is done, the user will need to complete tasks corresponding to the various components of the system.  The tasks are designed to be things that we would expect a user to do after they log in to the system.  The tasks are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item View the rules of the competition.
  \item View their floor's energy use and their standings in the energy competition.
  \item Participate in a commitment.
  \item Participate in an event (they will be given a confirmation code).
  \item Watch a video and answer a question.
  \item Edit their user profile.
\end{enumerate}

We will also ask the user to answer a few questions before, during, and after they complete the tasks.  Before they start to use the system, we will ask them about their level of familiarity with other social websites like Facebook and Twitter.  We will also ask them if they play games, whether they are console games (Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Wii), handheld games (Nintendo DS, PSP, iPhone), or if they play games on Facebook (if they have used Facebook before).  This is mainly to gauge their level of expertise, which we will consider when reviewing the test.

After the user completes the first task (initial login), we will ask them a few questions about the home page.  First, we will ask the user to give us their initial impressions of the interface.  After that, we will ask the user to describe the things they can do from that interface.  Because we want our interface to be clean and intuitive, it is important to get their initial feedback before they start working on the tasks.

After the user completes all of the tasks, we will ask the user about their experience using the application.  The questions we would ask include:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What did you like about the website?
  \item What areas could be improved?
  \item What difficulties (if any) did you have while using the website?
  \item Any other suggestions?
\end{enumerate}

This feedback can also be matched with what we recorded on the video in order to find additional issues.  We can also ask the user if about specific issues as they navigated the website.

% \section{Customization Evaluation}
% \label{customization}
% 
% To evaluate the customizability of Makahiki, we plan on using Makahiki to implement another university's past competition.  Note that many dorm energy competitions go with a simpler, more cost-effective solution for their dorm energy competition.  While the Kukui Cup is a full-featured dorm energy competition, we need to show that Makahiki can support the needs of universities that do not wish to spend a lot of money on hardware.  Thus, we plan on using Makahiki to implement a simpler dorm energy competition like Duke's Eco-Olympics and do a side by side comparison.  As a result, we aim to show that Makahiki can be tailored to the needs of other competitions.

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

\autoref{contributions} outlines our expected contributions for this project.  \autoref{timeline} provides a timeline for implementing Makahiki and analyzing the data.

\section{Anticipated Contributions}
\label{contributions}

We aim to provide a free, configurable, and modern framework that can be implemented by any organization that wishes to have an energy competition.  In addition to a basic content management system, Makahiki provides integration with WattDepot for providing near-real time energy updates.  It will also support point sub-competitions where users can participate in activities, commitments, and/or goals to earn points for their floor.  Makahiki will also have modern features such as views for mobile devices and integration with Facebook.

By holding our own dorm energy competition here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, we hope to evaluate how the different components of Makahiki are used and how they can be improved.  We also hope to demonstrate how configurable Makahiki is by creating a dorm energy competition web site that mirrors one of the many dorm energy competitions around the nation.
