Techreport 92-08 was done on a macintosh in latex.
The postscript version is available, as well as a
binhexed and stuffit'd version of the original macintosh
folder containing the latex source and pictures.
The references directory contains a file used solely
to generate the .bbl file, since Bibtex was not available
on the Mac when I was creating this paper.
