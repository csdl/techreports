will benefit from an application and those who must do
additional work to support it.  2) A factor contributing to
the decision-making failure that leads to ill-fated
development efforts is the unique lack of management
intuition for CSCW applications.  3) A factor contributing
to the failure to learn from experience is the extreme
difficulty of evaluating these applications.  These three
problem areas escape adequate notice due to two natural

multi-user application programs and multi-user computer

the way we think about cooperative work applications and

This paper describes an application specific hypertext system

It implements a specific method, called Issue
Based Information Systems (IBIS), which has been developed
for use on large, complex design problems.  The hypertext
system described here, gIBIS (for graphical IBIS),
makes use of color and a high speed relational database
server to facilitate building and browsing typed IBIS networks.
Further, gIBIS is designed to support the collaborative
construction of these networks by any number of
cooperating team members spread across a local area network.
Early experiments suggest that the IBIS method is
still incomplete, but there is a good match between the
tool and method even in this experimental version.} )

weak groups for use in design and

The human resources of such groups are
often (potentially) strong, but restrained by
the organization of work and society; and
although the tools are cheap the activities are
demanding in terms of human resources.
This kind of work should be seen as a
supplement to participation in design
processes controlled by others.  When end
users participate in projects set up by
management, these "lay" designers often
lack familiarity with the tools and
techniques, they lack the power and
resources to influence the choice of
questions to be considered, and they are not
the ones deciding how to utilize the results
of a design project when actually changing
the workplace.
   To give the context of the work on
which the paper is based, I first describe the
Scandinavian tradition of trade union based
end user participation in systems
development.  Then I discuss some of the
issues involved in improving the conditions
for independent end user design activities.  I
go on by presenting a set of "cheap tools"
and techniques, including the use of mock-up's.
This set covers the issues of
establishing the possibility of alternatives, of
creating visions of new and different uses of
technology, and of designing computer
support.  A central question in relation to the
tools and techniques, is their accessibility to
end users, and I discuss this based on the
notions of family resemblance and "hands-on"
experience.} )

Small group design sessions were empirically studied to understand

workspace activity may be characterized as concerned only with storing
information and conveying ideas through text and graphics.  Empirical
evidence shows that this view is deficient in not accounting for how the
workspace is used: a) in a group setting, rather than by an individual,
and b) as part of a process of constructing artifacts, rather than just a
medium for the resulting artifacts themselves.  An understanding of
workspace activity needs to include the role of gestural activity, and the
use of the workspace to develop ideas and mediate interaction.  A
framework that helps illustrate an expanded view of workspace activity
is proposed and supported with empirical data.} )

the ways that professional office workers use electronic
mail to manage their daily work.  A number of
implications for the design of flexible mail systems are
discussed.
   Two principal claims are made.  First, electronic mail is
more than just a communication system.  In addition to
supporting information management, it provides a
mechanism for supporting a variety of time management
and task management activities.  Some people are
prioritizers, concentrating on the problem of managing
incoming messages.  Others are archivers, concentrating
on how to archive information for subsequent use.
Similarly, some people use mail to delegate tasks, while
others perform tasks delegated to them by others
electronically.
   The second claim is that use of electronic mail is
strikingly diverse, although not infinitely so.  Individuals
vary in their preferences, both in their general willingness
to manage their work electronically and in their specific
preferences along the dimensions described above.  This
diversity implies that one's own experiences with
electronic mail are unlikely to provide sufficient
understanding of other's uses of mail.  Mail designers
should thus seek flexible primitives that capture the
important dimensions and provide flexibility for a wide
range of users.} )
