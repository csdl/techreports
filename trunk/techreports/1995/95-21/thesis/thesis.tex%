\begin{abstract}
  This research analyzes a new computer-mediated communication tool
  called Flashmail.  I investigated how people use Flashmail and Flashmail's
  relationship to conventional electronic mail.  Participants in the experiment 
  loaded extensions for both systems.  These extensions enabled the system to gather
  data regarding the characteristics of the messages being sent.  This data 
  was then used to analyze the conditions under which one system was used 
  instead of the other.  It was found that Flashmail seems to be used whenever 
  the message is short, needs to be communicated in a short period of time, and 
  when both the recipient and the sender are logged into the system and active at 
  the time of sending.  In contrast, 
  E-mail was the communication mode choice for messages that were large (over 400 
  characters) and non-urgent, or when the receiver was either not logged into Flashmail 
  or had been idle for longer than 7 minutes.  These results indicate that flashmail
  is generally used as a rapid messaging method and works as a complimentary system 
  for the areas in which E-mail is not sufficient.

\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Computer-mediated communication}
Computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems use computers to structure,
store, and process communications. CMC is the use of computers to
facilitate human-human interaction.  This paper evaluates a new CMC
system called Flashmail.

Computer-mediated communication changes the way we interact with each
other.  The following quote by Robert Sproull draws a parallel between CMC
and a non-computer-mediated communication tool, the telephone.

\begin{quote}
  The telephone had extensive and unanticipated effects in part because it
  routinely extended attention, social contacts, and interdependencies
  beyond patterns determined by physical proximity. Reducing the
  constraints of physical proximity increased people's choice of
  interactions, whether with family members who had migrated from the farm
  to the city, or distant employees, or the boss. Amplification occurred
  because communication networks have a mutually causal, spiraling
  relationship with information networks, close relationships, conformity,
  and cultural change.... Our research demonstrates that, as the telephone
  did, new computer-based communication technology in some organizations is
  changing attention, social contact patterns, and interdependencies.
  \cite{Sproull93}
\end{quote}

Similar to the telephone, CMC allows people to communicate more information
in a shorter amount of time, regardless of physical settings.  For example,
suppose a student wishes to ask a question in regards to an assignment.  If
the student cannot locate the professor, the student can send the question
to the professor through electronic mail (E-mail).  The professor can then
respond to the question through the same medium.

With the use of a computer and a modem an individual can conduct many
activities without leaving their home.  Although the common use of CMC is
to further communication attempts within a business setting, many more
possibilities are becoming available.  Currently, people conduct bank
transactions, do research, read journals and articles, reserve books at the
library, get the daily news, look at movie listings, and even order pizza
using CMC.

In this thesis, I focus on two CMC tools: Electronic mail and Flashmail.

\section{Electronic mail}
Electronic mail is ``the electronic, one-directional transfer of
information in the form of a message, via an intermediate
(tele-)communication system, from an identified sending party to one or
more identified receiving parties.''  \cite{Vervest85}

E-mail allows an individual to send an electronic message to one or more
receivers.  The recipients of the message have the options of replying to
the message, deleting it, saving it, forwarding it, or simply doing nothing
with it and leaving it in their mailbox.

Some characteristics of E-mail are:
\begin{itemize}
\item E-mail messages do not interrupt the receiver. E-mail stores
  the messages for the recipient to read at their leisure.

\item Email allows the receiver to control when they read their mail.  E-mail messages
  collect in what is called an ``inbox'' and remain there until the
  recipient chooses to open the box and read their mail. 

\item There is no way for the sender to control the immediacy of response to an
  E-mail message.
  Since the recipient reads their E-mail at their leisure, the sender has
  to wait until the receiver opens their mailbox, reads the message and
  decides to respond to it. 

\item E-mail allows saving and categorizing of messages. This is useful for
  messages which need to be saved for future reference. 
  
\item E-mail allows attachments of other files to a message. This feature allows an individual
  to send several files at once easily.  

\item An E-mail messages can be addressed to multiple receivers. The ability to send the same
  message to several receivers at once saves a sender the hassle of having
  to re-address and send out the same message several times. 

\item E-mail is a synchronous messaging system. E-mail is asynchronous, meaning messages 
  that are sent
  are not received and viewed in the same time frame.  The time lapsed
  between when a message is sent and when it is read can vary from minutes
  to days. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Flashmail: an alternative to E-mail}
One problem with E-mail is the lack of a tool which facilitates
time-dependent messages.  Time-dependent messages are those whose
usefulness expires after a short period of time if they are not read.  For
example, say that you want to hold a meeting with colleagues in an hour's
time.  You can send them an E-mail, but if a recipient does not read their
mail before the meeting time, the message is useless to them.

Flashmail fills this gap.  Flashmail is a CMC tool which transfers
time-dependent messages in a manner which greatly increases their
effectiveness.  Flashmail can almost guarantee that the message will be
seen.  The sender can rest assured that once sent, the message will be the
first thing the recipient sees when they next look at their computer
screen.

Flashmail is a useful computer-mediated communication tool as it is a
mechanism to facilitate the transfers of time-dependent messages.  I
believe that people will use flashmail for all communications of this type.

One other feature of Flashmail is that it displays the idle time associated
with every user, as well as the machine they are working on.  The is an
important feature in that it enables everyone to know who is logged in,
where they are, and whether or not they are in front of their terminal.
For instance, if the idle time associated with an individual is ``0
seconds,'' you can be reasonably sure that if you send them a Flashmail
message, they will see it immediately.  However, if the displayed idle time
reads ``1 hour 20 seconds,'' they are probably nowhere near their machine.

3.) control over immediacy of response

5.) attachment of other files
6.) multiple receivers
7.) asynchronous/synchronous

Below are the characterstics of Email that I mentioned earlier and their 
comparisons to Flashmail.
\begin{itemize}
\item E-mail messages do not interrupt the receiver. This is a significant
  difference between E-mail and Flashmail.  Flashmail is deliberately
  intrusive and interrupts whatever the recipient is doing.  E-mail stores
  the messages for the recipient to read at their leisure.

\item The receiver controls when they read their mail. In E-mail, messages
  collect in what is called an ``inbox'' and remain there until the
  recipient chooses to open the box and read their mail.  When a Flashmail
  message is sent, a screen pops up on the receivers terminal containing
  the message, so the recipient is forced to view the message immediately.

\item There is no way for the sender to control the immediacy of response:
  Since the recipient reads their E-mail at their leisure, the sender has
  to wait until the receiver opens their mailbox, reads the message and
  decides to respond to it.  Since a Flashmail message is viewed within
  seconds of being sent, if a response is warranted, it is usually issued
  immediately.

\item Allows saving and categorizing of messages: This is useful for
  messages which need to be saved for future reference.  Flashmail has the
  ability to save messages, but it is not as convenient as saving E-mail
  messages. In fact, by default the messages are deleted.
  
\item Allows attachments of other files: This feature allows an individual
  to send several files at once easily.  Flashmail does not have this
  mechanism.  To send files using Flashmail, one would have to cut and
  paste the file contents into the Flashmail message buffer.

\item Can be addressed to multiple receivers: The ability to send the same
  message to several receivers at once saves a sender the hassle of having
  to re-address and send out the same message several times.  Flashmail
  also has this ability.

\item Asynchronous: E-mail is asynchronous meaning messages that are sent
  are not received and viewed in the same time frame.  The time lapsed
  between when a message is sent and when it is read can vary from minutes
  to days.  Flashmail is a synchronous messaging system in that the time
  between when a message is sent and when it is read is a matter of
  seconds.

\end{itemize}


\section{Experiment}
The purpose of this research was to test my hypothesis that people will use
Flashmail over Email primarily for time-dependent messages

\subsection{Duration}
The time period of the experiment was from March 11 through April 15.

\subsection{Method}
The participants in this experiment will be the members of the
Collaborative Software Development Laboratory (CSDL).

All data was collected through the Flashmail and VM systems automatically.
For VM, the data collected consisted of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Date and time at which a message was sent.
\item Whether or not the message sent was in reply to a previous message.
\item If message was a reply, the date and time the original message was
  sent.
\item Who the sender and recipients were.
\item Whether or not the sender was logged into Flashmail.
\item Whether or not the recipient was logged into Flashmail, and their
  Flashmail idle time when appropriate.
\item The size of the message sent.
\item Time lapsed between the sending of a message and its' reply.
\end{enumerate}

The Flashmail data involves:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Date and time at which a message was sent
\item Whether or not the message sent was in reply to a previous message.
\item If message was a reply, date and time the original message was sent.
\item Who the sender and recipients were.
\item Recipient(s) Flashmail idle time(s).
\item The size of the message sent.
\item Time lapsed between the sending of a message and its' reply.
\item Number of people logged into Flashmail at any given time.
\item Dates and times at which the Flashmail menu is being pulled down.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Design}
Flashmail is a system designed to be complimentary to E-mail and was
implemented in 1995 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa by Professor
Philip Johnson.  Flashmail allows synchronous electronic messaging through
a pop-up window mechanism and was developed to assist inter-group
communications.  It was designed using Egret, a framework for
computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) applications. Egret implements a
multi-client, multi-server, multi-agent architecture. Egret clients and
agents are implemented by a 15 KLOC extension to XEmacs, the X-window Emacs
editor.  Egret servers are implemented by a 15 KLOC system written in C++.

Flashmail is a real-time communication method complimentary to E-mail.
Flashmail's main feature is that it is deliberately intrusive upon the
receiver.  This feature allows the sender to assume the receiver has seen
the message, as the transmission will be the first thing the receiver sees
when they look at their computer screen.  In contrast to email, this allows
an efficient method of transmitting time-dependent messages.

\section{Features}
\begin{itemize}
\item Indicates which group members are currently logged in to a
  workstation: This determines who a user can and cannot send a Flashmail
  message to.  If a user is not logged in, the system will not allow a
  message to be sent to them.

\item If a group member is logged in, the idle-time associated with their
  workstation is given: This is extremely useful for knowing if a Flashmail
  member will see your message immediately.  If the idle time displayed
  reads ``0 seconds,'' then it is most likely that the recipient will see
  the message as soon as it is sent.  On the other hand, if the idle-time
  reads ``2 hours,'' the individual has not been near their machine in
  quite a while and will not see the message until they return.

\item Gives real-time information on which workstation each group member is
  using: This allows other group members to know where everybody else is
  located.  Every machine has a name, and if you know where that particular
  machine is located, you know where to find that group member.  The
  utility of this is that it gives group members who work in different
  parts of a building the ability to locate other members without having to
  physically track them down.

\item Deliberately intrusive: This is what differs Flashmail from many
  other CMC tools.  Flashmail has a mechanism that pops up a window
  containing the message on the receiver's screen.  This window will appear
  over whatever the receiver is doing.  In this respect, it is intrusive,
  but it assures that the message will be seen immediately.  Should a group
  member be particularly busy and wish to ensure that they will not be
  interrupted, Flashmail can be turned off, thereby preventing anyone from
  sending them a Flashmail message.

\item The sender can assume the receiver has seen the message: As mentioned
  above, the idle-time associated with each user is displayed, if the idle
  time reads ``0 seconds'' at the time you send that individual a Flashmail
  message, you can assume they will see the message immediately as they are
  currently active on their machine and the message appears over whatever
  they are working on.

\item Messages are delivered and received practically instantaneously: In
  contrast to E-mail, where the delivery is sometimes unpredictable,
  Flashmail messages appear on the recipients screen almost immediately
  after being sent.  A sender can rest assured that once a Flashmail
  message is sent, it appears on the receiver's screen within seconds.

\item Can be addressed to multiple receivers: Like E-mail, Flashmail
  provides the capability to send several individuals the same message at
  once.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Interface}
The Flashmail main menu is shown in Figure 2.1.  The users are dat, cmoore,
johnson, jgeis, rosea, julio, and russ.  Cmoore, rosea, julio, and russ are
all dimmed because they are either not logged on, or they have not
activated Flashmail.  Although user jgeis is logged in, she is dimmed
because she is the current flashmail user. The current user is always
dimmed as one cannot send a flashmail to oneself. Dat, johnson, and jgeis
are all currently logged in and can be sent flashmail messages.  For these
three users, Flashmail displays the workstation they are currently using
and their idle time.  In this instance, user dat is using the workstation
named bianca and has been idle for 25 seconds.

To illustrate how Flashmail is utilized, suppose jgeis wants to send user
``dat'' a Flashmail message.  First, the sender selects dat from the
available users in the Flashmail menu, notice that the box next to dat's
name is darkened, indicating the selection.  One can also send the message
to multiple recipients if so desired.

  {\centerline{\psfig{figure=/group/csdl/techreports/95-21/figures/mainmenu.ps}}}
  \caption{The Flashmail Main Menu}
  \label{Main-menu}
\end{figure}


A window as in Figure 2.2 then pops up on the senders screen and the
message to be sent is typed in. A click on the ``send'' button delivers the
message.

  {\centerline{\psfig{figure=/group/csdl/techreports/95-21/figures/compose.ps}}}
  \caption{Composing a Flashmail Message}
  \label{Compose}
\end{figure}

At this time, a window appears on dat's screen containing the original
message.  The recipient has the options of either deleting the message or
replying to it.  In this instance, the message necessitates a reply.
Figure 2.3 is dat's response, where he included the original message by
means of a ``cite'' mechanism shown in the reply-menu of Figure 2.4.

\section{Analysis}

My original hypothesis was that once individuals were introduced to
Flashmail, they would prefer it over E-mail for the communication of
time-dependent messages within their Flashmail group.  After attempting to
implement a method through which I would justify my hypothesis, I realized
that the statement was far to vague.  Eventually, I settled on learning
about the conditions under which Flashmail was utilized over E-mail.  I
believed that Flashmail is used primarily for messages that have a greater
dependency on time than most electronic communications, and I set about
attempting to prove this.  Although I don't believe that I have ``proved''
this hypothesis, I believe the results of my research lend it credence.

According to my data, the circumstances under which an individual utilized
one system over another varied.  However, the primary characteristics of a
Flashmail message were these:
\begin{itemize}
\item Short:

  On average, a VM message was seven times larger than a Flashmail message.
    
  The most probable reason for the difference in buffer size is the nature
  of the mediums.  A Flashmail message, intrusive by nature, demands the
  immediate attention of the recipient.  To send a rather lengthy message
  via Flashmail would be equivalent of dropping a several-page long paper
  on someone's desk and ordering them to read it immediately. It can be
  perceived as inconsiderate and irritating depending on the importance of
  the message being conveyed.

  As for VM messages, they are stored in the receiver's ``inbox'' for them
  to read later at their own convenience.  If a message is particularly
  lengthy, the reader has the option of saving the message and reading it
  in portions as time permits.  Although this ``save to read later'' option
  is possible in Flashmail, it is extremely inconvenient.

\item Low recipient idle-time:
    
  The average idle-time for a recipient of a Flashmail message was 6.7
  minutes, while the average Flashmail idle-time for a E-mail recipient
  (where both the sender and receiver were logged into Flashmail) was 16.7
  minutes.

  I had actually expected the difference in idle-times to be somewhat
  greater, but I think the results are reasonable.  However, I must mention
  that the calculated idle-time varies depending on what method of
  computation you use.  When a Flashmail message was sent to more than one
  person, The idle times sometimes varied quite drastically.  For example a
  message could be sent to two users, one whose idle-time is 0 seconds, and
  another whose idle-time reads 6 hours.  In general, most Flashmail
  messages were sent to individuals with idle-times of 0 seconds, or a few
  minutes at most. In calculating the data for this, I included all
  idle-times from every recipient.  If I just included just the idle-times
  from messages to one individual only, the calculated idle-time average
  would be 1.7 minutes.

\item Rapid response time (for messages requiring a response):
  
  Time elapsed between when a VM message is sent and when its' reply is
  issued is over 200 times than that for a Flashmail message.  (Time
  elapsed for VM = 15.9 hours, Flashmail = 4.6 minutes)

  A Flashmail message appears immediately on the recipient's screen,
  practically requiring an immediate response.  If the receiver is not
  directly in front of their computer at the time the message is sent, the
  message will still be the first thing they see when they return to their
  computer.  In addition, Flashmail beeps when a message is received, so if
  the receiver is close by, but not looking at their computer, they are
  audibly notified of the incoming message.

  As for getting the reply quickly, since a flashmail message only has two
  real options ``delete'' and ``reply'', the receiver either has to send
  their reply immediately, or push the buffer aside and have it take up
  window space until they do reply.  In this respect, it is much more
  convenient to issue the reply, delete the window, and go on with whatever
  you were doing than to wait until later to respond.

  As VM message wait for the recipient to open the inbox to read their
  mail, it could be hours or days before the message is read.  Even when
  the message is read, there is no guarantee that the recipient will issue
  a reply to it immediately. The receiver of the message is hardly
  inconvenienced by deciding to wait until later to send a response.
\end{itemize}

There are other interesting pieces of data that I came across, and although
I am not able to tie them into the scope of this research, I feel that I
should at least mention them.

First I found that Flashmail has 13.8 percent more original messages sent
than E-mail.  One possibility for this is that VM messages tended to have
somewhat longer threads (series of messages originating from one original
message) than Flashmail messages.  The average Flashmail thread (including
original) was 2.9 messages, while the average E-mail thread was just over
4.0 messages.
   
I also found that some individuals used the Flashmail menus to ``just see
who's around.''  I recorded data on how often Flashmail group members
pulled down the menu.  Although I did not do any statistical analysis on
this data, I noted that most individuals pulled down the menu roughly 8 or
more times a day, and occasionally did this as many as 30 or more times in
a single day.  Only a small fraction of these ``menu-pull-downs'' resulted in
actual Flashmail messages being sent, so obviously this system is serving
another purpose besides being strictly a messaging tool.

\chapter{Conclusion}
My goal was to investigate whether or not Flashmail is a viable CMC tool
and under what conditions it normally is used.  I found that it is a useful
CMC tool which is generally used for short messages to individuals who were
currently active at their machine at the time of sending.

Although E-mail generated much more messaging traffic than Flashmail,
Flashmail was used periodically by all members of the study.  It appears
that Flashmail is being utilized as an ``add-on'' to E-mail, in other
words, Flashmail seems to be complimenting E-mail rather than competing
with it.

My justification for this statement is that almost all Flashmail messages
fit a certain pattern, the messages were primarily under 400 characters in
length and sent to individuals with idle-times usually well under 7
minutes.  I do not believe that all messages that fit this criteria will be
sent via Flashmail, but I do think that if a message fits this pattern, it
is more likely to be communicated through this route than E-mail.  If the
message fits this criteria and necessitates a rapid response, I believe
that it is almost guaranteed that the Flashmail messaging system will be
used instead of E-mail.

As I mentioned above, Flashmail will not replace E-mail, instead Flashmail
makes up for the areas in which E-mail is not sufficient.  E-mail is weak
in the transmission of messages which the sender wants to be seen fairly
quickly.  This is Flashmail's primary purpose, and so far, Flashmail seems
to be more than adequate for the task.  \nocite{*}
