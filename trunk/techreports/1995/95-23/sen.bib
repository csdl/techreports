program designed to investigate evolution in collaborative systems.
Evolution is of central concern due to the exploratory nature of many
CSCW application areas, including software development, document
preparation, issue generation and discussion, and so forth.  In
exploratory domains, the ill-defined or changing nature of both the
problem and an acceptable solution to it impose special demands.  For
example, the criteria for an acceptable solution, or the solution
generation method may be an an emergent property of the exploratory
process.  This paper discusses our research paradigm and initial progress.}

defines both a data and a process model along with supporting analysis
techniques that provide novel support for exploratory collaboration.  To do
so, the EGRET framework breaks with traditional notions of the relationship
between schema and instance structure.  In EGRET, schema structure is
viewed as a representation of the current state of consensus among
collaborators, from which instance structure is allowed to depart in a
controlled fashion.  This paper discusses the issues of exploratory
collaboration, the EGRET approach to its support, and the current status of
this research.}

help the learner make sense of and organize the subject content of

reviewing, writing, discussion), and compare and contrast various
viewpoints from individual learners.  It is our primary purpose to
construct an example instance of such a representation, and to show that
useful computational manipulations can be performed on it, and that the
combination of the representation and related computational services can
actually lead to the improved learner's performance on selected

construction processes. It asserts an essential role of knowledge
representation in achieving a high-level collaborative support. Our central
claim is that the presence of an expressive and usable representation,
combined with necessary computational support, can significantly enhance
the learners' performance in understanding the subject content of learning
artifacts, integrating various classroom activities, and relating different
viewpoints held by other learners. First, we propose a representational
framework, called RESRA, which characterizes the thematic structure of
learning and research artifacts. We then develop a computer-based tool,
called CLARE, that facilitates the use of RESRA for various collaborative
learning tasks, such as evaluating existing work (e.g., papers, programs,
design) or constructing new work. We also design a set of experiments which
will allow us to empirically assess the effectiveness of CLARE and our
research claims.},

Traditional database and hypertext structural models do not provide

that defines a novel data and a process model along with services for
exploratory collaboration.  To accomplish this, EGRET departs from
traditional notions of the relationship between schema and instance
structure.  In EGRET, schema structure is viewed as a representation of the
current state of consensus among collaborators, from which instance
structure is allowed to depart in a controlled fashion.  To provide such
exploratory services in a responsive interactive environment, EGRET
implements specialized architectural mechanisms. This paper presents the
concepts and implications of exploratory collaboration, followed by the
design and implementation of EGRET.  The paper concludes with our results
to date, which demonstrate that EGRET succeeds in providing useful services
for exploratory collaboration, through interesting technical and cultural
issues remain to be addressed before exploratory collaboration can become
commonplace in CSCW systems.}

   YEAR = 1993,
   SUMMARY = {Formal technical review (FTR) encompasses a range of structured,
collaborative methods employing technical personnel to improve the quality
of a software development artifact.  Research shows that FTR, when
appropriately practiced, provides significant benefits. However, research
also shows that FTR introduces substantial new overhead, and that its
cost-effectiveness is easily compromised by a variety of group process
obstacles.  In addition, current FTR practice is difficult and costly to
investigate effectively, and thus many important questions about its nature
and comparative effectiveness remain unanswered.

This document presents a research agenda intended to address problems in
both the practice and research of FTR through CSRS (Collaborative
Software Review System), an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative
work environment. CSRS provides automated support for many time consuming
aspects of FTR, avoids many group process problems inherent in traditional,
manual review, and captures unique, high quality empirical data about the
process and products of FTR.

The research agenda includes:
(1) Controlled experimental laboratory studies on automated FTR support.
(2) Technology transfer of CSRS to selected industrial sites.
(3) Development of a domain-specific version of CSRS for C++ software.
(4) Creation of a CSRS consortium for collaborative FTR research between
    industry and academia.},

   TITLE = {{CLARE}: A Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning Environment Based on the Thematic Structure of Scientific Text},
   YEAR = 1994,
   CATEGORIES = {CLARE},
   MONTH = {May},
   ABSTRACT ={This dissertation presents a computer-based collaborative learning
environment, called CLARE, that is based on the theory of learning as
collaborative knowledge building. It addresses the question, "what can a
computer do for a group of learners beyond helping them share information?"

CLARE differs from virtual classrooms and hypermedia systems in three ways.
First, CLARE is grounded on the theory of meaningful learning, which
focuses the role of meta-knowledge in human learning.  Instead of merely
allowing learners to share information, CLARE provides an explicit
meta-cognitive framework, called RESRA, to help learners interpret
information and build knowledge. Second, CLARE defines a new group process,
called SECAI, that guides learners to systematically analyze, relate, and
discuss scientific text through a set of structured steps: summarization,
evaluation, comparison, argumentation, and integration.  Third, CLARE
provides a fine-grained, non-obtrusive instrumentation mechanism that
keeps track of the usage process of its users. Such data forms an important
source of feedback for enhancing the system and a basis for rigorously
studying collaboration learning behaviors of CLARE users.

CLARE was evaluated through sixteen usage sessions involving six groups of
students from two classes.  The experiments consist of a total of about 300
hours of usage and over 80,000 timestamps.  The survey shows that about 70%
of learners think that CLARE provides a novel way of understanding
scientific text, and about 80% of learners think that CLARE provides a
novel way of understanding their peers' perspectives.  The analysis of the
CLARE database and the process data also reveals that learners differ
greatly in theirinterpretations of RESRA, strategies for comprehending the
online text, and understanding of the selected artifact. It also found
that, despite the large amount of time spent on summarization, up to 66% of
these learners often fail to correctly represent important features of
scientific text and the relationships between those features.  Implications
of these findings at the design, empirical, and pedagogical levels are
discussed.},

   ABSTRACT = {Formal technical review (FTR) is an essential
   component of all software quality assessment, assurance, and

   research methodology problems.
  
   CSRS is an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative work
   environment for formal technical review.  CSRS addresses problems in
   the practice of FTR by providing computer support for both the
   process and products of FTR.  CSRS also addresses problems in
   research on FTR through instrumentation supporting fine-grained, high
   quality data collection and analysis.  This paper describes CSRS, a
   computer-mediated review method called FTArm, and selected findings
   from their use to explore issues in formal technical review.},

method to improve software quality have
been well documented, and yet there is a proliferation of the methods in 
practice with varying degrees of success. Worse, the same methods are
often practiced inconsistently and the contribution of various review
factors on review outcomes is also not currently understood.

This research proposes a new approach to assess and study the
cost-effectiveness of various review factors. Our basic approach is to
first develop a framework that allows one to classify the similarities 
and differences of existing FTR methods from the perspective of their
review processes. 
Specifically, the framework looks into important review factors that
characterize a review process, such as the objective of a particular
phase within the review process, the interaction mode among review 
participants and the technique being used during the phase.

Second, we will
develop a computer assisted review system, namely, CSRS version 3.0,
that can be used as an experimental testbed for empirically evaluating
different FTR factors that may impact the methods. 
Finally, we will design a control experiment to answer an important
initial question concerning the cost-effectiveness of three different
examination techniques commonly used in existing FTR methods: free
review technique, selective test cases technique and stepwise
verification technique.},

   CATEGORIES = {CSRS},
   YEAR = 1996,
   MONTH = {July},
   ABSTRACT = {  Design of new computer-based environments to replace or augment
  traditional, manual work procedures is typically problematic due to
  its experimental and embedded nature: the requirements for the
  computer-based version of the task may not be well defined, and the
  outcome of introducing computer-based support may well change the
  nature of the task altogether.
   
  This paper illustrates these issues through a discussion of the
  evolution in the design of CSRS, an instrumented, computer-supported
  cooperative work environment for formal technical review.  CSRS was
  originally designed in response to well-recognized shortcomings in
  traditional, non-computer-based formal technical review methods.  The
  initial design was thus founded upon a principle-centered basis,
  where the system was oriented toward solving known problems in the
  domain of formal technical review.  Over time, the design has evolved
  toward a more organization-centered basis, in which the system is
  oriented toward support for adoption and use within organizations, even
  if that support conflicts with the ``principles'' of formal technical
  review.  We conjecture that such an evolution may be inevitable in
  experimental and embedded design domains. },

``Collaboration Mechanisms for Project HI-TIME: Hawaii Telecommunications
Infrastructure Modernization and Expansion: A Model for Statewide

In the project, in response to the requirements for Project HI-TIME, a
collaborative architecture called ``CA/M'' has been designed and
implemented and used to build a collaborative system for Project
HI-TIME.  As of November 1, 1995, the CA/M architecture and its 
application to Project HI-TIME has not yet been fully evaluated, which
motivates the pending no-cost extension to the grant period. 

This interim report documents the current state of the project, providing an
overview of Project HI-TIME requirements, the CA/M architecture designed
in response to the these requirements, and the status of research on 
this project.  A revised version of this report containing results from
the evaluation of the CA/M architecture will be provided at the termination
of the extended grant period.",
