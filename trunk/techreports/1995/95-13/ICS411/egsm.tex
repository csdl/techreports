\item Problems that I had with paraphrasing technique (please
explain):
\begin{itemize}
\item we need more time for this kind of going
\item explaining things 


\item sometimes it is hard to say what the code does before you understand
it well
also, some c source is not easy to paraphrase

\item None, I found it very useful.
\item What do I say
\item I felt that the presenter could have used more paraphrasing when going
through the code.
But I thought that paraphrasing was good.

\item NO PROBLEMS
\item None
\item The paraphrasing was effective, but could be improved by paraphrasing
the code in laymans term.





\item no problems
\item Do you mean paraphrasing what each line means aloud?  I like that idea.

\item It would probably have been code to describe it in psuedocode rather
than in direct C for clarity.
\item No problem
\item Understanding some of the code
\end{itemize}

\item Problems that I had with the presenter (please explain):

\begin{itemize}
\item He wasn't that comfortable doing what he was doing
We need to get more used to it
\item He/she wants to finish all the modules
\item I was the presenter.
\item Presenter could have spoke a little louder and clearer.

\item NONE
\item He was great!
\item presenter did a good job of presenting all source nodes
\item none.
\item Not at all
\item Not really.
\item Kind of slow
\item The presenter did not clearly explain the code due to illness
\end{itemize}

\item Problems that I had with the moderator (please explain):
\begin{itemize}
\item Our group did everythin perfectly so we did not need a
moderator

\item None.
\item none.

\item NONE
\item None
\item none

\item none.
\item No problems.
\item Was very helpful especially in time of trouble and/or when certain
things were a bit unclear.
\item No problem
\item No problmes
\end{itemize}


\item Problems that I had with EGSM system (please explain): 
\begin{itemize}
\item None

\item I felt that certain areas of this review system were unstable.
\item none
\item The mouse is not responsive.  It is hard to point and drag
\item there should be an easy way of tracing or searching variables,
functions, etc.
sometimes it is hard to find stuffs
maybe adding a watch window would help
or if I can open two or more source windows
\item None.  I was just not as familiar with sparcstations as I am with PC's.
\item none
\item none but I may have had if I was the presenter.

\item JUST GETTTING USED TO THE COMMANDS
\item same as previous questionnaire for the individual review.

\item In my individual review, I did not like it, as I had forgotten how it
worked, and I had not reviewed for it.  It was much much more useful
this time around.
\item I didn't have any
\item I wish we can bring our probgram along
\item No problems
\end{itemize}


\item Problems that I had with EGSM process (please explain): 
\begin{itemize}
\item NOne
\item none
\item None.
\item well, I wasn't quit sure if I was presenting the material OK or not
\item none.

\item WORKING TOGETHER AS A GROUP WITHOUT MUCH EXPERIENCE OR TIME TO GET TO
KNOW ALL OF THE MEMBERS WELL.

\item same as previous answer.

\item none ( now )
\item if one of the participants does not know much, he/she can slow down
the entire process.  However he/she would learn a lot from the session
because of interaction with members more knowledgeable in the subject.

\item No.
\item I wish we could do the group review first before the individule review.
\end{itemize}

\item Suggestions on how to improve EGSM system (please explain):
\begin{itemize}
\item None
\item please see \#46
\item More emphasis on procedures
\item none.
\item THE SYSTEM WAS VERY INTERESTING TO WORK WITH.  THE COMMANDS WEREN'T
THAT HARD.
\item same answer as previous questionnaire for the individual review.

\item I don't really have any.
\item If we can bring in our program, we can do more corrections
\item None, well for now, everything worked out fine
so maybe if I worked more on this, I would `probably find
something to improve.
\end{itemize}


\item Suggestions on how to improve EGSM process (please explain):
\begin{itemize}
\item None
\item Explainations for the code to review should be done ahead of time, and
better descriptions should be given.
\item allow user to write something to another user

\item Would be interesting to see how this system would hold out when placed
over a long distance network with maybe a box for communication chat
instead of the audio from the system being conducted person to person.
Maybe test it by having people in different rooms of Keller form a group.
\item none.

\item NONE
\item same as previous answer.


\item Sometimes, to achieve optimum performance, it is essential that all
participants are knowledgeable about the subject at hand
\item It is really cool now, can't think of any suggestions.
\item I cannot think any at this moment.
\end{itemize}

\item Other comments:
\begin{itemize}
\item NOne
\item In general I felt this system was ok.  It allowed for group
involvement, certain explainations for code and evaluation were
unclear at times.  I felt you needed a better evaluation of code.
\item Good idea for FRT!!
\item The group had trouble with (!strncmp. . . .) condition that occurred
frequently in the code.  We were not exactly sure what was meant, if
the strings are supposed to be the same or not the same.
\item Overall I felt that this was an excellent way to conduct reviews on
source code.

\item code is too long.  I feel sleepy after a while.  Productivity was
greatly reduce as time goes on.
\item THE GROUP PROCESS WENT VERY WELL.  WE DIDN'T RUN INTO MANY PROBLEMS.
OUR PRESENTER HAS USED THIS SYSTEM BEFORE SO WE NOT HAVE THAT MUCH
DIFFICULTY IN USING THE SYSTEM.  THE MODERATOR WAS VERY HELPFUL WHEN
WE NEEDED HELP.  THE AMOUNT OF FUNCTIONS WAS QUITE ALOT.  IT WAS
TIRING AFTER A WHILE BUT NEEDED GREAR ATTENTION FROM ALL MEMBERS.
\item none

\item I would like to see results of our review.  Dont' know if
we picked out all errors in the code.  In other words, feedback
would be nice.
\item I cannot think any more comment at this moment.  I just want to go
home to study.
\item I feel this EGSM is great.
But this would have been more productive if we had
more trainning and better understaning about the code.

\end{itemize}
