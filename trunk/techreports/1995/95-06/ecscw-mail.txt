TITLE: Building Software Review Systems Using CSRS

AUTHOR: Danu Tjahjono

ABSTRACT:

The importance of Software Review or Formal Technical Review (FTR) and
its benefits have been well documented. However, there are many
variations of the method in practice, especially those related to the
group process.  This paper discusses a new approach to how
organizations can build their own review systems that are most
suitable to them.  Our basic approach is to use CSRS modeling
languages to characterize the review method descriptively.  The
language descriptions are then compiled to generate the corresponding
review systems.  CSRS modeling languages are developed based on FTR
framework which models both variations in the group process
and review strategies exhibited by current FTR methods.
