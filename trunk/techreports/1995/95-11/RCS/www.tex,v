\chapter{The World Wide Web as a Tool for Community Building}
\label{chap:www}
This chapter describes how we used the World Wide Web as a tool for community
building.  Section \ref{sec:background} discusses how it came into existence
and then goes into some detail about how it works.  Section \ref{sec:design}
enumerates the community-oriented features we built into our system and
explains some design decisions.

%The last section discusses other features important to any information system.

\section{What is the World Wide Web and Why use it?}
\label{sec:background}
The World Wide Web (WWW or Web, for short) is a ``distributed, heterogeneous,
collaborative, multimedia information system'' \cite{Berners-Lee94}.  It is a
seamless network of information, all of which is accessible simply and
consistently.  It supports universal readership in a hypertext environment and
uses the client-server model.  Designed with no centralized control, the Web is
easy to scale.  Anyone wishing to publish information need only run a server
while those who wish to access information need only run a client application.
This ``web'' of clients and servers runs on top of the networking
infrastructure provided by the Internet.

A Web Server acts as the interface between a database and a client program
using the WWW protocol specification, HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol).  It
is also possible for a Web Server to interface with WAIS, GOPHER and ftp
servers.  However, Web Servers primarily serve information from a local
database, which is structured as a directed graph of linked files.  There is
one main file, or Home Page, which serves as a default entry point to
information in a particular database.  However, users may access any file in
the database, given its Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or ``address''.

Since the Web uses HTTP, files are usually written in HyperText Markup
Language (HTML) format.  An HTML file consists of text and tags.  The text is
displayed to the reader of an HTML document while the tags tell the client
programs, or browsers, how to format that text.  Documents written in HTML have
the ability to link regions of text to another document. Browsers highlight
these regions to indicate that they are hypertext links.  

Documents may contain links to other files in the database as well as other
files residing on other Web sites.  Selecting these links retrieves the
document associated with it.  Thus, users may navigate through the Web by
simply following links in various documents.

The idea for the Web was conceived in 1989 but has began rapidly gaining in
popularity in 1993.  That was when the National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) released its first alpha version of Marc Andreessen's
``Mosaic for X.''  Since then, Web servers have emerged all over the world in
universities, companies and government agencies in an effort to quickly
disseminate information to as large an audience as possible.

In this research, we chose to use WWW for our communication infrastructure for
three reasons:

\ls{1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{It is simple to publish and retrieve information on it.}
\item{Its software is in the public domain.}
\item{Training would be less difficult as some people were already using it.}
\end{enumerate}
\ls{1.5}

Having decided upon a tool for community building, our next task was to extend
it to test the thesis of this research.

%This free, popular, easy-to-use system seemed to be the best choice for our
%needs.  In designing the system for our organization, we had to decide what
%were important characteristics of a community-oriented information system.

\section{A Community-enhancing Web Site}
\label{sec:design}
A community-enhancing information system should be designed to improve the
measures of community described in Chapter \ref{chap:introduction}.  The design
should enhance a person's feelings of importance and belonging in the
organization.  It should provide a way for users to become more self-aware of
the people and projects in their organization.  

%The following features were implemented on our system in response to these
%design requirements.

Figure \ref{fig:UHPage} shows the ICS Home page, which overviews how department
information is organized.  There are 5 main areas of interest: research,
education, facilities, people and Web services.  We discuss how we implemented
different features in each area of our system in response to our design
requirements.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=UHPage.eps}}
\caption{A screen shot of the ICS Home page.}
\label{fig:UHPage}
\end{figure}

%A community-oriented information server should contain information about each
%person's personal interests.  In an academic organization, research interests
%should be included while commercial organizations might want to include current
%projects of individuals and/or subgroups.  There should also be a section
%detailing programs or services offered by the organization.  Just as families
%maintain photo albums of themselves, so should an organization maintain a
%photoboard of all of its members.  Information systems can offer useful
%information when compiled and organized properly by a willing maintainer.
%However, allowing all members involved in an organization to make their own
%contribution will add a unique flavor to the information presented.  By
%increasing the visibility between the members of an organization, we also
%increase the sense of community within it.  Here we enumerate the
%characteristics of a community-oriented information server.

\subsection{Getting People Involved}
\label{sec:involved}
Part of feeling a sense of community has to do with feeling a sense of
importance and belonging in the organization.  Two major areas of the
information system were designed with this in mind.  Both of these areas
involve user participation.

The first area falls under the category of ``People''.  It contains two
subsections which were created to augment feelings of importance and belonging
in our members.  We included a listing of all home pages created by department
members where each item is a link to the respective page.  Participation in the
creation of home pages was strictly voluntary and unregulated.  That is, we did
not disallow users from publishing on the Web nor did we require approval of
their work.  This feature supports importance because it implies trust in
giving users ``carte blanche'' on what they published and offered them a choice
of participation.  The second item is a Photoboard of department members.  This
part of the database is dynamically created on a daily basis.  Users
voluntarily posted their pictures on this board.  These pages support feelings
of belonging because only members of the ICS department were listed.

The second area that contributes to importance and belonging appears under the
category of ``Web Services.''  Of those listed, the one that contributes to
importance is the feedback page.  This page was provided for users to ask for
help on system usage and to receive comments and suggestions on the system.
This supports importance because users were acknowledged and their comments
taken seriously.  During this study, all department members who requested help
got it or were referred to a more appropriate place.

\subsection{Staying Informed}

Becoming aware and maintaining awareness of people and their projects in an
organization contributes to its members' sense of community.  Four major areas
of our information system contribute to this purpose.

The first one comes under ``Research.''  In this area, readers learn about the
different research groups and their related projects.  There is also a
repository of publications by department members.  This information can help
members learn about resident experts within the department.

The second one falls under the ``Facilities'' category.  This includes a map of
the department.  It is an interactive map, allowing users to click on a portion
of the map and thus retrieve data about that place.  In our department map,
faculty and department offices are included.  Pictures of faculty and staff
members are on these Web pages and allow people to associate names with faces.

The third area is called ``People.''  In Section \ref{sec:involved}, we
mentioned how this contributes to a person's sense of importance and belonging.
Here, we show how it also contributes to self-awareness of people in the
organization.  We have a complete listing of the faculty with links to their
pages or, if they do not have one, a page describing their work and interests.
A listing of students could not be compiled and published without their
expressed permission.  However, students who published home pages implicitly
gave their consent, so we have a listing of a subset of ICS students.  Like the
department map, the photoboard helps users identify names with faces.  Also
included is a page called ``Personal Interests.''  The home pages of people
sharing the same hobby are listed together.  This page is created by a unix
shell script executed daily which searches user home pages for listings of
their hobbies.  Hobbies must be listed in a certain format in a home page for
the program to process it correctly.  Instructions for this procedure are
posted online.  This feature does not address the measure of people knowing
each other personally, but it provides a way for people to make that attempt.
Upon learning that people share the same hobbies, they may optionally go to the
home page of those people with similar interests to learn more about them and
how to contact them.

The last area is ``Web Services.''  It includes a page that lists documents
that were recently changed in the database.  The database may be accessed
anytime at a user's leisure.  They are free to choose what information to
access.  As new items are added to the database, users have no way of knowing
what information has been added.  New information differs between users.  We
attempt to keep the users abreast of changes in the database by having a
``what's new'' page.  This document lists items changed in the last few days,
week and month.  Unfortunately, Web servers do not automatically detect changes
in the structure of the database.  That is, they are unable to detect changes
in the way documents are linked.  Aside from parsing all HTML documents in the
database, the only automated way to discover changes in content is to check the
date a document was last modified.  However, this has the disadvantage that
changes made to a file due to a typographical error are indistinguishable from
significant changes of content.  In any case, until a better mechanism for
detecting modifications is developed, listing recently modified documents that
may include those with insignificant changes is better than not listing them at
all.  Change notification is important because it keeps users up to date on the
state of information.  

Also included in the ``Web Services'' area is a page that gives statistics
on database accesses.  Users may want to utilize this feature in designing
their Web pages.  They can get statistics on when, from where and how often
their pages were accessed.  This is useful because users may publish
information and upon reading statistics on it find that people are not
accessing those items.  They could thus modify their pages in response to these
statistics.  This contributes to self-awareness in the organization.

%\section{Desirable Qualities in Information Systems}
%\label{sec:otherChars}
%\subsection{Self-Maintenance} 

%The information content must be as self-maintaining as possible. This
%facilitates scaling of the information system.  We want to create a
%collaborative system whose contents are generated and maintained both
%explicitly and implicitly through the activities of the people in an
%organization.  Self maintenance means both that information should be added as
%a side-effect of people's normal work processes, and should be deleted as an
%outcome of garbage-collection activities.  The maintainer of the Web server, or
%webmaster, would explicitly keep the system up to date by adding new
%information or modifying documents to reflect changes.  The database is also
%implicitly maintained by users who create their own home pages.  These
%documents are the sole responsibility of the users that create them.  They can
%change the contents of the documents and they also decide whether or not to
%keep them at all.  As an added measure of self-maintenance, it is easy to write
%a program to search the file system for user-created home pages and maintain
%this list on a daily basis.  As more people create home pages, their document
%will be automatically added to the list.  The expiration of these files is not
%a problem since a member's account and files are purged once they leave the
%organization.  The photoboard can be maintained in the same way as the list of
%home pages.  Users may keep a file of their digitized picture in their
%directory.  The program would search the file system for such files and
%maintain that list on a daily basis.  Users can change their picture or refrain
%from displaying their picture without having to consult the webmaster.  The
%elimination of the ``middle-man'' also expedites matters concerning how
%immediately the changes will take effect.  A Web site with some built-in
%self-maintenance allows for its usefulness to outshine the overhead necessary
%in the upkeep of the system.

%\subsection{Change Notification}
We implemented the above mentioned features and included other information
about the department such as degree programs, course descriptions, computing
policies, etc.  The ICS home page is accessible at {\tt http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/}.

%\subsection{User Involvement}
%So far, much of the information suggested for inclusion could be compiled by a
%third party.  This is generally the person that maintains the Web server.
%Having information provided by one source is good in that everything can be
%presented uniformly and tailored around a common theme, making the overall view
%of the system more coherent.  It is limited in that it presents only one
%perspective of the organization.  We want to further increase the sense of
%family by fostering an environment where its members can make their own
%contributions to their organization's information system.  This can be easily
%implemented because Web Servers allow users to create their own Home Page.
%These documents are maintained by the user.  They are free to include any
%information they wish in their sub-network of files in the database.  The 
%implied trust among members combined with their freedom of expression is
%intended to increase one's sense of importance which affects the level of community.
%% ....I feel like there should be more

%%\subsection{Photographs}
%Having a photoboard of all the members in an organization is comparable to
%having a photo album of members of an extended family.  We want to create this
%sense of family in the organization.  Members in an extended family do not
%generally know every other member.  But keeping a record of all the names and
%faces helps to maintain the family bond.  People in an organization don't have
%to know every other person, but it is helpful to have a photoboard as a
%reference.  It can facilitate introductions of new members and help to avoid
%embarrassing moments of forgetting names.  While it is not necessary to go out
%and memorize all the names and faces or to meet each person, the photoboard is
%intended to show that this is a place where you belong.

%%\subsection{Subgroups}
%It is important to include information about people's personal interests.
%Most organizations are not founded upon personal interests, but rather on a
%common goal or mission, usually professional.  Making others in the same
%group aware of one's hobbies is an attempt at encouraging further bonding
%within a community.  This may not increase the overall sense of community 
%since it is unlikely that a group formed professionally will have the same
%hobbies.  However, it is likely to form clusters of subgroups.  Using a Web
%server, this could be implemented by having a document, linked by the main
%home page, dedicated to the purpose of displaying everyone's personal
%interests.  It should list many different hobbies and those people who enjoy
%participating in that activity.  The list of hobbies and people would start
%out small.  At first, we expect user's interests to vary greatly such that
%we may get a listing of many different interests associated with only one
%or two people.  As more people in the organization use the system, they
%will view others' interests, realize they share it too and will go ahead
%and add their names.  Some level of community would be developing as people
%become more aware of other's interests and offer to share a bit of
%themselves by adding their own interests to the list.

%%\subsection{Projects}
%We also want to include a page detailing projects and research interests of
%different individuals or groups in the organization.  In larger
%organizations, people's attention tend to remain narrowly focussed on their
%own projects.  We want to make people aware of other projects being
%conducted to shed light on how the different parts of an organization
%combine their efforts to attain their high-level goals.  Having information
%about each others projects also informs us who is the resident expert on a
%subject area.  Accessing this page demonstrates that the viewer has more
%than a passing interest in what goes on in the organization.  People showing
%interest in areas of their organization outside their own work contributes
%to the sense of community.

%\subsection{Measurement}
%An information server is useful only if it is being used.  Database accesses
%can be automatically logged by Web servers.  It is important to measure this
%data in various ways so that the system may be updated to more fully serve its
%users.  The information logged includes the hostname of the client making the
%request, the date and time of access, which file was requested and an error
%code.  There is one log entry for each request, successful or unsuccessful.
%The data can be analyzed to see which files receive the most requests as well
%as which ones rarely get any attention.  The fact that files are globally
%accessible is incidental to this system being housed on the World Wide Web.
%Unlike other sites intent on disseminating information to the outside world,
%the server for this research is designed around the needs of our intended
%community.  Therefore, we are more interested in network traffic generated from
%within our domain than from the outside.  We also want to assess how the
%database evolves over time.  User participation, or creation of home pages, can
%be measured by checking for the first instance of its successful access.  It is
%also noteworthy to learn when there are increased levels of home page creation.
%It would probably coincide with advertisements or training sessions.  The
%cohesiveness, or how tightly linked is the database can be revealed by charting
%the intra-domain links or by calculating the percentage of intra-domain links
%over total links.  We stress this inward design since this is a
%community-oriented database.  Analysis of this information is intended to make
%a more focussed and functional information system which is community friendly.

Traditionally, these systems are used to provide multi-media information, such
as text, graphics, video and sound.  Viewing information in these different
ways can do more than just inform; it can entertain, enlighten, spark interest

their intended audience.

The structure of Web servers can range from totally unstructured to highly

A community-oriented information system should incorporate features that
address the different measures of community as described in chapter
\ref{chap:introduction}.  We need to consider a person's feelings of importance
and belonging in the organization.  Allowing all members in an organization to
make their own contribution helps support their sense of significance and
belonging.  The collective self-awareness of the group is supported through the
inclusion of a photoboard, research section and personal interests section.

The database may be accessed anytime at a user's leisure.  They are free to
choose what information to access.  As new items are added to the database,
users need some mechanism for knowing what information has been seen before and
what is new.  New information differs between users.  We attempt to keep the
users abreast of changes in the database by having a ``what's new'' page.  This
document lists items changed in the last few days, week and month.  In keeping
with our attempts at self-maintenance, we want to avoid having people
explicitly notify others of changes to their pages.  Unfortunately, Web servers
do not automatically detect changes in the structure of the database.  That is,
they are unable to detect changes in the way documents are linked.  Aside from
parsing all HTML documents in the database, the only automated way to discover
changes in content is to check the date a document was last modified.  However,
this has the disadvantage that changes made to a file due to a typographical
error are indistinguishable from significant changes of content.  In any case,
until a better mechanism for detecting modifications is developed, listing
recently modified documents that may include those with insignificant changes
is better than not listing them at all.  Change notification is important
because it keeps users up to date on the state of information.
