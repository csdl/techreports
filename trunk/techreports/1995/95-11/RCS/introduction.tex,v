\section{What is Community and Why Bother with it?}
This research concerns computer-based mechanisms for improving the
sense of community within an organization.  It is often easy for a group to
lose sight of its goal or for its members to feel alienated, thereby
contributing to the breakdown of sense of community.  Building community is
important because it builds morale amongst its members and helps the group to
function better as a whole.  It is important enough that the Rockefeller
Foundation commissioned a report \cite{Sharp94} from the Millennium Group to
investigate methods of revitalizing communities.  This falls under the
Foundation's Common Enterprise Initiative, which is viewed as ``an advocate for
the whole''.  They recognize the significance of community and their report is
a first attempt to rebuild and revitalize our communities.

How does one even begin trying to build community in an organization?  We must
first know what it means to be one.  Webster's dictionary \cite{Webster84}
lists the following definition:

\ls{1}
\begin{verbatim}
1 : a unified body of individuals : as
     1  a : STATE, COMMONWEALTH
        b : the people with common interests living in a particular 
            area; broadly : the area itself
        c : an interacting population of various kinds of individuals
            (as species) in a common location
        d : a group of people with a common characteristic or
            interest living together within a larger society
        e : a group linked by a common policy
        f : a body of persons or nations having a common history or
            common social, economic, and political interests
        g : a body of persons of common and esp. professional 
            interests scattered through a larger society
     2 : society at large
     3  a : joint ownership or participation
        b : common character : LIKENESS
        c : social activity : FELLOWSHIP
        d : a social state or condition 
\end{verbatim}
\ls{1.5}

The broad meaning of the word community is a ``unified body of individuals.''
But in what ways are they unified?  According to Clark \cite{Clark77}, there
are communities of place and of interest.  Man has historically built his
community on the basis of place.  The place in which he was born and raised
became the place he lived and raised his family, thereby continuing the cycle
of life.  However, fundamental changes in transportation, communication and
other aspects of society produced a new form of community based on interest.
Man's increase in spatial mobility allowed him to more easily move his
residence.  His social mobility allowed him to move easily through the social
ladder.  Lastly, his cognitive mobility allowed him to absorb and comprehend
other ideas and experiences from far across the globe \cite{Clark77}.  Through
these changes, community is no longer synonymous with one's neighborhood.
Where communities of place are typically concerned with the maintenance of
tradition, communities of interest are typically concerned with action and
innovation.  Interests and issues are what gathers people together with great
inspiration and motivation.  The focus of this study, the Department of
Information and Computer Sciences (ICS), is a community based on interest.

The sense of community in an organization is not a binary entity.  We cannot
say that it either exists or it does not.  As with many other difficult to
measure concepts, community exists in varying degrees.  Clark \cite{Clark73}
defines community as

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
  ``a sentiment which people have about themselves in relation to others and
  others in relation to themselves;...there are two essentials for the
  existence of community: a sense of significance and a sense of solidarity.
  The strength of community within any given group is determined by the
  degree to which its member's experience both a sense of solidarity and a
  sense of significance within it.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

More importantly, it is the perception of those involved that determines the
relative strength of a community.  Taking this a step further, the strength of
a community is also based on the community's sense of self-awareness.  For how
can one feel important or bonded with others without first knowing who they
are, what they do and how they contribute to the community?

In this thesis, we view a ``sense of community'' as a combination of several
ingredients, including: each group members sense of significance, their sense
of solidarity and their collective sense of self-awareness.  From this
definition, it is possible to characterize the level of community in an
organization by evaluating the following measures:

\ls{1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Do members feel they play an important role?}
\item{Do members feel a sense of belonging?}
\item{Can members associate names with the faces of others in the
  organization?}
\item{Do members know each other personally?}
\item{Can members correctly identify a `resident expert,' if there is one, on
  subjects of importance to the organization?}
\item{Are members aware of the different projects or issues in the
  organization?}
\end{enumerate}
\ls{1.5}

\section{Research Thesis}
The basic premise of this research is that an organization's sense of community
can be positively affected through computer mediation.  An information system
designed with features that support our measures of community was the testbed
for this study.

The thesis of this research is that an appropriately designed information
system can improve the sense of community in an organization.  To evaluate this
thesis, we adopted an information system and extended its design with the above
measures in mind.  We used pre-test and post-test questionnaires to assess the
sense of community, and we analyzed logfiles kept by the information system to
evaluate how the system was actually used.

%\section{Computer mediated support for building community}
\section{Research Method and Results}
We investigated the strengths and weaknesses of a computer-based approach to
improving the sense of community within one organization, the Department of
Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii.  We used the
World Wide Web's communication infrastructure to support community building in
our department.  This seemed to be the best choice for our needs as the related
software is free, popular, and easy to use.  So, we set up a Web server for the
ICS department with features designed specifically for improving the sense of
community.

Based on our measures of community, we came up with requirements for a
community-enhancing information system and incorporated them.  One requirement
was that it should help the community members feel important in the group.
This was accomplished by providing the users with an unedited voice in their
publication effort.  The system was also extended to foster a sense of
belonging.  We built mechanisms for facilitating user involvement and
contributions to the information system.  Several additional features were
incorporated to increase a group's collective self-awareness.  We included a
photoboard of organization members.  There were sections identifying the
subgroups of the organization.  These subgroups could be formed through common
personal or professional interests.  Other sections highlighted the various
projects underway in the department.

%\section{Research Method}
Our goal was to increase the sense of community in the department with the
support of computer-based mechanisms.  Armed with our tool, we set out to study
this approach at community building over the course of one semester.  Before
starting, department members anonymously and voluntarily filled out a pre-test
questionnaire.  This questionnaire was designed to evaluate the ``baseline''
level of community.  Next, we introduced our Web site to the department,
offering training sessions on how to access information as well as how to
contribute to it.  We conducted introductory classes throughout the semester
and held some advanced ones in the latter half.  At the end of the semester, we
had department members fill out a post-test questionnaire to assess the level
of community at that time.

The results of this research are as follows:

\ls{1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Department members did not view their group as one community, but
  envisioned themselves as three communities: faculty \& staff, graduate
  students and undergraduate students.}
\item{The faculty \& staff felt importance and belonging and had a high sense of
  collective self-awareness both before and after the introduction of the
  information system.}
\item{Initially, the graduate and undergraduate students did not feel important
  in the department but did feel a sense of belonging.  Their collective
  self-awareness was poor.}
\item{At the end of the study, graduate students did not feel important but
  still felt belonging in the department.  However, their collective
  self-awareness seemed to increase.}
\item{At the end of the study, undergraduate students neither felt importance
  nor felt belonging in the department.  But their collective self-awareness
  seemed to increase.}
\end{itemize}
\ls{1.5}

\section{Research Contributions}
The results of this research have given us many insights into computing systems
and communities.  These are the contributions our research has made to those
fields.

\ls{1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Physical inequities, such as equipment or laboratory resources, can
  inhibit community development.}
\item{The collective self-awareness of a group can be a double-edged sword.
  Information dissemination flowing in one direction can reveal inequities
  and polarize a community.}
\item{We have a successful design of an information system.  Department
  members quickly adopted the system and are still using it.}
\item{The World Wide Web is typically promoted as a means for universal
  readership of hypertext documents.  This research articulates an
  alternative purpose for the Web.}
\item{Collective self-awareness can improve through computer mediation.}
\end{itemize}
\ls{1.5}

%We learned through questionnaire responses that poor communication and
%information dissemination can inhibit community development.  In an attempt to
%increase information sharing, we learned that allowing information to be open
%and accessible to all without providing a means for people to be involved can
%inhibit community.  As visibility increased between the three groups, the
%undergraduates felt further alienated after comparing resources, support and
%research projects.  We saw through the data logs kept by the Web server that
%most of the system usage was that of publication.  Users spent more time
%publishing information about themselves than accessing information about
%others.  Importantly, we learned that an appropriately designed information
%system can serve as a diagnostic tool for factors promoting or inhibiting
%community in a given organization.

\section{Related Work}
A few systems have been developed for similar purposes.  We first discuss GC
EduNET, an information system designed for supporting educators in the Georgia
education system.  We then discuss the Davis Community Network, a virtual
community created to enhance the physical one composed of its residents.  We
also mention the Well, a global virtual community popularized and recounted by
Rheingold \cite{Rheingold93}.

%talk about how these systems have a recipe for community - internet access

GC EduNET \cite{Wolpert91} is an electronic information service developed to
bring together Georgia teachers and school administrators and to create to a
pool of resources important to that group.  The system provides capabilities
for conferencing, email, file sharing and database searching.  It is unique in
its design to alleviate teacher and administrator isolation.  The system
services more than 1500 members covering 101 counties in Georgia.  In addition
to supporting email and conferencing, the system was organized into six major
areas: Libraries, Questions and Answers, Electronic Marketing, Center for
Adolescent Needs, Software and File Exchange and Organizations.  The major
difference between GC EduNET's online community and that of the ICS department
is their absence of a physical community.  They designed a system to create a
community of interest {\em online}.  They did not have a membership; they
created one for the purpose of sharing experiences and resources.  The group
exists only in a virtual community.

The Davis Community Network ({\tt http://www.dcn.davis.ca.us:80/}) is a
non-profit organization created for residents of Davis, California.  Its
purpose is to strengthen the community of Davis by providing Internet-based
communications and information services and support.  More specifically, they
provide newsgroups pertinent to the Davis community, mailings lists, and a WWW
server.  The Web site offers information on local businesses, city government,
education, entertainment and tourist and new resident information.  Like the
ICS department, this online group was created to enhance their physical bond.
However, theirs is a community of place servicing a much larger membership
where the roles of the citizens are not as clearly defined as in communities of
interest.

The Well (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) is an online service based in San
Francisco providing connection to USENET newsgroups, the World Wide Web, Gopher
and its own MUSE (multi user simulation environment).  Users from all over the
world may join and more than half of its members are from outside of
California.  The Well is also associated with physical communities in the San
Francisco Bay and New York City areas. 

There are many other community-enhancing systems\footnote{A list is available
at http://www.well.com/user/hlr/vircom/index.html} for various types of groups.
They often incorporate the same technology and software: email, WWW, Gopher,
etc.  However, few have modified these systems to address the particular needs
of their organization.

\section{Organization of this Thesis}
Chapter \ref{chap:www} discusses how we used the World Wide Web, which provides
the infrastructure for the information system we used in launching our
experiment.  We further detail the requirements for a community-oriented Web
site and how we implemented these requirements.

Chapter \ref{chap:experiment} explains how we conducted the experiment.  We
explain the use of questionnaires to assess the the sense of community in the
department.  We also discuss the introduction of the system and the training
involved to get department members interested in using it.  We also outline the
possible outcomes of the experiment.

Chapter \ref{chap:results} presents the results of the experiment.  We detail
each of the questionnaire responses.  We also discuss the logs of database
accesses.  Analysis of these logs reveals how much of the department
participated as well as who participated.  It also gives us some insight on
access and publication patterns of its users.

Finally, Chapter \ref{chap:conclusion} analyzes the results.  We look at the
implications of the results and provide guidance for future research in this
area.


%This will prove to have a catalytic effect on the sense of community in the
%department.

%Positive answers to all of these questions indicates a high level of community
%and collective self-awareness.  Small and stable organizations would tend to
%have a high sense of community.  Large and transient organizations would tend
%to be not as self-aware.  The Department of Information and Computer Sciences
%(ICS) is one example.  Here are some anecdotes illustrating a lack of or low
%level of community:

%\begin{enumerate}
%\item{A fellow Master's student who had been in the program for almost two
%  years stated he had never seen a particular faculty member.}
%\item{I have been with the department for almost two years and I feel that I
%  know the staff and many students personally.  However, I am personally
%  familiar with only a handful of the twenty faculty members.  This is mainly
%  due to the fact that I've worked with them closely either as their teaching
%  assistant or on a research project.}
%\item{Another fellow graduate student told to me that when he was asked which
%  faculty member to see regarding a particular field of computer science, he
%  could not give the new student an answer.}
%\item{Upon introducing ourselves on the first day of a graduate seminar
%  class, a student mentioned he worked in one of the department's research
%  labs.  My professor responded by suggesting that the student inform us of
%  what goes on in that lab since nobody else knows.  One would at least
%  expect faculty members to be aware of each other's projects.}
%\end{enumerate}

% What new insight about the problem will be provided through this
% research?  Why is solving this problem interesting?

The broad meaning of the word community is a `unified body of individuals'.
But in what ways are they unified?  According to \cite{Clark77}, there are
communities of place and of interest.  Man has historically built his community
on the basis of place.  The place in which he was born and raised became the
place he lived and raised his family, thereby continuing the cycle of life.
However, fundamental changes in transportation, communication and other aspects
of society produced a new form of community based on interest.  Man's increase
in spatial mobility allows him to more easily move his residence.  His social
mobility allows him to move easily through the social ladder.  Lastly, his
cognitive mobility, allows him to absorb and comprehend other ideas and
experiences from far across the globe \cite{Clark77}.  Community is no longer
synonymous with one's neighborhood.  Where communities of place are typically
concerned with the maintenance of tradition, communities of interest are
typically concerned with action and innovation.  Interests and issues are what
gathers people together with great inspiration and motivation.  The object of

%The World Wide Web was chosen over other communication infrastructures because
%it is simple to use, scales well and its related software is in the public
%domain.  All of these features contributed to the growth and popularity of the
%Web.  The idea for the Web was conceived in 1989 but has gained in popularity
%since 1993 with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)
%first alpha version release of Marc Andreessen's ``Mosaic for X''.  Since then,
%Web servers have emerged all over the world in universities, companies and
%government agencies in an effort to quickly disseminate information to as large
%an audience as possible.  People found that accessing this information was as
%simple as a mouse click and Web ``surfers'', or readers, continue to grow at an
%immeasurable rate.

%This free, popular, easy-to-use system seemed to be the best choice for our
%needs.  In designing the system for our organization, we had to decide what
%were important characteristics of a community-oriented information system.
