\chapter{The Server subsystem: Storage, coordination, and control}

The ECS server subsystem implements a set of core services for Egret
clients.  The server subsystem classes provide facilities for establishing
connections to HBS server processes, creating basic nodes and links,
maintaining consistent state between clients, and inter-client communication
mechanisms.

The ECS server subsystem does not provide mechanisms to support a typed
hypertext data model (the purpose of the Type Subsystem), user interface 
facilities (the purpose of the Generic Interface Subsystem), or 
measurement utilities (the purpose of the Metrics Subsystem). 

This chapter presents the major features of the Server subsystem through
the design and implementation of small classes.  In each case, the class
conforms to CSDL standards for object oriented design and implementation;
please see the appendices if you are not familiar with these concepts.

Most of these example applications assume that you have already brought up
an HBS client, a Gagent, and an ECS client.  They also assume that you have
read Chapter 1 of the ECS Design Document (the overview of the entire
system) and Section 3.1 (the overview of the Server subsystem).
