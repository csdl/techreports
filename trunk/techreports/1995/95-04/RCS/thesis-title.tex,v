\begin{abstract}
  The Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN) is a system designed to support
  {\em strong collaboration} among a group as they cooperatively build,
  review, revise, improve and learn from a structured hypertext document.
  AEN was used as the central instructional and research system for a
  graduate seminar on collaborative systems at the University of Hawaii
  during Fall, 1994.  In Spring, 1995 we conducted an experimental case
  study to evaluate AEN's support of {\em strong collaboration}.  The
  study helped define strong collaboration and showed that AEN does
  support strong collaboration.

         %AEN was used for over 285
%         hours during the second half of the semester alone, and
%         users generated over 800 nodes and 800 links.  Lessons
%         learned about strong collaboration include: (1) Users as
%         well as artifacts should be visible; (2) Provide direct
%         and indirect authoring mechanisms; (3) Provide
%         context-sensitive change information; (4) Provide access
%         to intermediate work products; (5) Maintain database
%         integrity; (6) An agent-based architecture may be
%         necessary for systems supporting strong collaboration;
%         and (7) The WWW is not effective for strong
%         collaboration.
