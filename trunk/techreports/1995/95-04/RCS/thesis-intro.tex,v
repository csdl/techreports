\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

\section{Motivation}

With the rapid expansion of the World Wide Web (WWW) \cite{Berners-Lee94},
the use of hypertext as a structuring mechanism for richly interdependent
information is becoming widespread.  Indeed, hypertext is almost certain to
be the `lingua franca' of the information superhighway.  The WWW allows
authors to collaborate by including sections of other authors' documents.
Unfortunately, WWW provides little support for collaborative authoring
beyond including someone else's work.

The issues associated with collaborative authoring have been investigated
by many researchers.  Baecker et. al. \cite{Baecker93} provide several
requirements for collaborative writing systems.  They include: preservation
of identities, enhanced communications, enhanced collaborator awareness,
annotations, undo, session control, explicit roles, variety of activities,
transition between activities, several document access methods, separate
document segments, version control, one or several writers, and synchronous
and asynchronous writing.

This thesis investigates the issues related to collaborative hypertext
document construction.  Specifically, it investigates and characterizes a
form of collaboration termed {\em strong collaboration}.  In strong
collaboration, each participant contributes to the construction of the
document, and gains new knowledge as a direct result of this construction.
The constructed document is not simply a patchwork of individual
contributions, but instead, an incremental, emergent synthesis that
reflects the knowledge created by the group as a whole.  In general,
strong collaboration most often (though not always) occurs in non-computer
mediated, face-to-face contexts such as a group software design session or
an interactive classroom setting.  A distinguishing characteristic of strong
collaboration is a sense of collective authorship over most, if not all of
the components of the document.  Documents produced in this way should be of
higher quality, because more perspectives have combined to produce, review,
and correct errors in it.

Strong collaboration is at one end of a collaborative spectrum.  I call
the other end of the spectrum {\em weak collaboration}.  Weak collaboration
uses a divide and conquer process --- participants divide up the document
and work independently on their section.  There is very little interaction
between the participants.  When all of the sections are finished, the
document is created by combining the sections into a whole.  A
distinguishing characteristic of weak collaboration is distinct authorship
of components of the document.  

Computational support for weak collaboration is well established.  For
example, word processors or editors allow different authors to create
subsections of a document and combine them together.  E-mail can deliver
different sections of a document to an editor who compiles them.  In
contrast, the computational needs of strong collaboration are not well
established.  For example, very few editors allow more than one author to
edit the same document at the same time.  In order to understand strong
collaboration, I implemented a collaborative hypertext authoring
environment called the Annotated Egret\footnote{Exploratory Group Research
EnvironmenT} Navigator (AEN).  This environment provides tools designed to
encourage strong collaboration and measurement facilities designed to
detect strong collaboration, if it were to occur.

AEN is built upon Egret \cite{csdl-93-09}, a client-server hypertext
database manager.  Authors/learners use AEN's typed nodes and links to give
the hypertext document structure.  They also use an access control model to
dynamically restrict the type of access to the individual nodes in the
database.  Several autonomous agents help AEN manage all of the information
needed to support strong collaboration.

\section{Research Thesis}

The basic premise of this research is that strong collaboration can be
enabled and encouraged through computer mediation.  The process of strong
collaboration can be supported by tools that assist the group in their
collaborative process.

The thesis of this research is that AEN provides a viable computer mediated
environment for strongly collaborative hypertext document creation.  AEN's
main features were designed with collaboration in mind.

To evaluate this thesis, I designed an operationalized definition that
can be used to empirically assess the degree to which AEN supports strong
collaboration.  I developed questionnaires to evaluate the user's feelings
about AEN's support for collaboration and AEN itself.

\section{Research Design and Results}

The ability of AEN to support strong collaboration was evaluated through a
case study during the Spring of 1995.  The study looked for strong
collaboration, recorded the tools used, and asked the users for their
opinions of the tools provided by AEN.

    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
      \hline
      {\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}{\bf Operationalized
      Definition }}& {\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}{\bf Corresponding Metric(s)}}\\ \hline

      under development&\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:op-metrics}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
\normalsize

In order to detect strong collaboration, I developed a metric for each
component of the operationalized definition of strong collaboration. Table
\ref{tab:op-metrics} summarizes the operationalized definitions and their
corresponding metrics.

I used these collaborative metrics to detect occurrences of 
collaborative behaviors.  In order to evaluate AEN's set of tools, tool use
was monitored and a post study survey asked the participants their
impressions of the tools.

The data analysis reveals that a high score for each metric was recorded by
at least one of the groups studied.  However, no single group scored high
on all five metrics.  These results indicate that AEN does support the
various components of strong collaboration, but the results do not
demonstrate that AEN allows a single group to collaborate strongly with
respect to all metrics simultaneously.  Chapter \ref{sec:analysis} explores
the results of the case study in detail.

\section{Contributions of this research}

This research addresses an important area of research --- the use of
computer mediated tools as a means to facilitate collaborative authoring of
hypertext documents.  It raises a number of significant questions.  For
example, what are characteristics of strong collaboration?  What types of
computational augmentation are required to encourage strong collaboration?
Though this research may not lead to definite answers to these and many
other questions, it does represent a first step toward understanding of
these important issues.

Conceptually, AEN provides an operationalized definition of strong
collaboration.  This definition and the associated metrics allow the
detection and measurement of collaborative behaviors.

Technically, AEN is both a research and authoring tool.  The former is
evidenced by the built-in instrumentation that allows fine-grained process
data to be collected.  The latter is evidenced by the set of features
designed to support collaborative authoring.

Empirically, the data from the Fall, 1994 and Spring, 1995 use of AEN
confirmed that AEN is a viable approach to supporting collaborative
authoring of hypertext documents.  The results also suggest a number of
interesting directions in which AEN can be extended and empirical
investigations which can be conducted.

\section{Organization of this document}

The remainder of this thesis is organized as follows. Chapter
\ref{sec:related-work} examines other collaborative learning and authoring
systems.  Chapter \ref{sec:AEN} introduces AEN.  Chapter
\ref{sec:evaluation} is a discussion of how I evaluated AEN's design and
its support for strong collaboration.  Chapter \ref{sec:analysis} discusses
the results of my evaluation.  Chapter \ref{sec:conclusions} presents some
conclusions about strong collaboration.  Chapter \ref{sec:future} discusses
future directions for AEN.

Unfortunately, WWW provides little support for collaboratively authoring
hypertext document beyond including someone else's work. Many issues
concerning collaborative hypertext construction are difficult to
investigate using WWW. For example, issues such as, simultaneous editing,
change notification, and restricted access are very difficult to implement,
because of WWW's scale.  So to explore stronger collaboration in authoring
and learning, we had to implement our own collaborative hypertext
authoring/learning tool, the Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN).

The agents maintain information on who's connected and what they are doing,
the current status of all nodes, the global state of the database, and a
list of people that should be notified of any changes.  All of this
information is important in strong collaboration because, in strong
collaboration, each participant contributes to each section of the artifact
as it is being developed.  In order to contribute to each section, each
participant must know the current state of the sections.  That current
state includes who is working on it and any changes to the contents.  The
AEN agents help maintain the information necessary for the process of
strong collaboration.

During the process of strong collaboration, each participant is
contributing to the construction of the artifact, and gaining new knowledge
as a direct result of this construction.  The constructed artifact is not
simply a patchwork of individual contributions, but instead, an
incremental, emergent synthesis that reflects the knowledge created by the
group as a whole.  In general, strong collaboration most often (though not
always) occurs in non-computer mediated, face-to-face contexts such as a
group software design session or an interactive classroom setting.
d113 4
a116 11
Strong collaboration is at one end of a collaborative spectrum.  The other
end of the spectrum is the traditional divide and conquer method of
collaborating.  We call the divide and conquer method weak collaboration
since there is very little interaction between the participants.  In weak
collaboration, each participant works on their own section of the artifact
independently.  When all of the sections are finished the artifact is
created by combining the sections into a whole.  A distinguishing
characteristic of weak collaboration is distinct ownership of the sections.
Each section can be directly attributed to a participant.  A characteristic
of strong collaboration is group ownership of the sections.  Each section
can not be directly attributed to a single participant.
d118 4
a121 9
Computational support for weak collaboration is well established.  Word
processors can import different artifacts to create a new artifact.  E-mail
can send different sections of the artifact across the globe to other
contributors.  The World Wide Web is essentially a collection of
independently authored artifacts.  However, the computational needs of
strong collaboration are not well understood.  So, we designed AEN to
explore computer support of strong collaboration in the creation of
hypertext documents.  In order to support strong collaboration AEN must
also support weak collaboration.

The data collected shows that, across all of the groups, each of the

is capable of supporting strong collaboration. However, since a single
group did not display high scores in all five metrics, we cannot say that
AEN does support strong collaboration.  There could be some odd interaction
between the five major features of AEN that does not allow a group to score
high in all five metrics.  Chapter \ref{sec:analysis} explores the results
of the case study in detail.

In order to help detect %define

component of the definition.  The following is our operationalized
definition and corresponding metric for strong collaboration:
a125 5
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\em Members read each other's nodes.}  Strong collaboration requires
  that the members of the group know the current state of the artifact.
  Without reading the other nodes members have no way of contributing to
  the nodes.
d127 4
a130 2
  {\bf Metric:} {\em Readers per node (RPN)}.  This metric measures the
  number of readers per node.  
d132 2
a133 35
\item{\em Members edit nodes that were also edited by others.}  This
  is the most direct way that members can collaborate on a node.  One author
  creates a node, then another author adds to it.

  {\bf Metric:} {\em Member Co-editing (MCE)}.  This metric measures the
  number of members that each member co-edits with.
 
\item{\em Document nodes are edited by more than one person.}  This
  operationalization ensures that there is interaction among the group
  members for each node.  Without this interaction the node is created in a
  weakly collaborative way.

  {\bf Metric:} {\em Editors per node (EPN)}.  This metric measures the
  number of editors per node.

\item{\em Members create feedback nodes.}  This is another way for group
  members to collaborate.  They can create feedback on the contents of a
  node.

  {\bf Metric:} {\em Feedback Node Creation (FNC)}.  This metric measures
  the number of feedback nodes created by each member.

\item{\em Members manipulate access control to publish/protect artifacts
  under development.}  By changing the access control members are able to
  dynamically control the process of collaboration.

  {\bf Metric:} {\em Non-default Access Control (NAC)} and {\em Evolving
  Access Control (EAC)}.  These metrics measure two different features of
  access control.  NAC measures if the node's access control has changed
  from the default and EAC measures if then node's access control has
  evolved over the life of the node.
\end{enumerate}

The data collected shows that, accross all of the groups, each of the
metrics had at least one instace that scored high.  This implies that AEN

With the rapid expansion of the World Wide Web \cite{Berners-Lee94} more
authors are writing hypertext documents.  The WWW has allowed more
of us to collaborate.  The issues of collaborating to develop hypertext
documents are becoming more and more important each day.  The use of
hypertext as a structuring mechanism for richly interdependent information
is becoming more widespread, and finds application in many areas of
software engineering and other fields.
d37 6
a42 3
Unfortunately, the WWW provides little support for collaboratively authoring
hypertext document.  So to explore collaboration in authoring and learning we
had to implement our own collaborative hypertext authoring/learning tool.
d44 10
a53 7
AEN\footnote{Annotated Egret Navigator} is built upon Egret
\cite{csdl-93-09} a client-server hypertext database manager.
Authors/learners use AEN's typed nodes and links to give the hypertext
document structure.  They also use an access control model to dynamically
restrict the type of access to the individual nodes in the database.
Several autonomous agents help AEN manage all of the information needed to
support strong collaboration.
d55 8
a62 12
Strong collaboration is the opposite of the traditional divide and conquer
method of collaborating.  Each participant works on their own portion of
the artifact independently.  When all of the portions are finished the
artifact is created by combining the portions into a whole.  We call this
divide and conquer method weak collaboration since there is very little
interaction between the participants.  One of the key characteristics of
weak collaboration is distinct ownership of the portions.  Each portion can
be directly attributed to a participant.  Computational support for weak
collaboration is well established.  Word processors can import different
artifacts to create a new artifact.  E-mail can send different portions of
the artifact across the globe to other contributors.  The World Wide Web is
essentially a collection of independently authored artifacts.
d64 11
a74 12
In strong collaboration, each participant contributes to each portion as it
is being developed.  During the process of strong collaboration, each
participant is contributing to the construction of the artifact, and
gaining new knowledge as a direct result of this construction.  The
constructed artifact is not simply a patchwork of individual contributions,
but instead, an incremental, emergent synthesis that reflects the knowledge
created by the group as a whole.  In general, strong collaboration most
often (though not always) occurs in non-computer mediated, face-to-face
contexts such as a group software design session or an interactive
classroom setting.  The computational needs of strong collaboration are not
well understood.  We designed AEN to explore computer support of strong
collaboration.

\section{Initial Experiences}

d90 1
a90 7
Over the past year, we have experimented with and redesigned AEN, a reader
and authoring system for hypertext, that places equal weight on supporting
the following, collaborative authoring of, and collecting data about user
interaction with, a hypertext document.  A third requirement of the system
is rapid response time. This system and our ideas about collaboration have
undergone extensive evolution as we learned more about the implications of
these requirements and their often conflicting natures.
d92 4
a95 9
It took three months to take AEN from a simple set of requirements to the
first prototype.  We came up with a simple hypertext authoring tool that
allows multiple authors to edit different nodes of the same hypertext
document at the same time.  In the Fall of 1994 we used the initial
prototype in a graduate seminar class ICS 691.  The class used AEN and it's
database as the text book and example of a collaborative system.  During
the semester the students found bugs in AEN and made over 28 suggestions
about improving AEN.  We redesigned and made AEN more robust.  During the
Fall semester we developed the concept of strong collaboration.
d97 18
a114 6
We hoped that the Fall, 1994 ICS 691 class would demonstrate strong
collaboration. However, due to problems with the reliability of AEN, they
lost faith with AEN and did not use it for collaboration. The students
learned that AEN could not be trusted to keep all of their work.  They
began using alternative methods to collaborate and just uploaded the
results to AEN for grading.
a115 28

\section{Experimental design and results}

Since we were unable to detect strong collaboration during the fall of
1994, we decided to conduct an experimental case study during the spring of
1995.  Three groups in an undergraduate class in software engineering used
AEN to develop their requirements documents.  Each group consisted of five
students.  They worked with private companies developing software products
for the companies.  The groups learned how to use software engineering
principles to develop their software products.

In order to detect strong collaboration within the groups we have
operationalized strong collaboration into the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Members create feedback nodes.}
\item{Members read each other's nodes.}  
\item{Each member edits nodes that were also edited by others.}
\item{All document nodes are edited by more than one person.}  
\item{Authors concurrently edit the same document node.}
\item{If team members are simultaneously logged in, Partyline is used.}
\item{A majority of members find the Snoopy and Partyline features for
  physical presence to be useful.}
\item{Members manipulate access control to publish/protect artifacts
  under development.}  
\item{All nodes underwent manipulation of access control.}
\end{itemize}

As a result AEN was redesigned and made more robust.  During the Fall
semester we developed the concept of strong collaboration.

The best way do describe strong collaboration is to give an example.  Four
authors have been given the task to develop a four act play.  In the
classic ``weakly'' collaborative method the authors would divide up the
play by acts and assign an act to each author.  They would then write their
acts and at the end combine the four acts to produce the play.  Each act
has only one author and can be directly attributed to that author.  In a
slightly more collaborative way they could each write one act and then pass
that act on to another author for rewrite.  In this method each act has two
authors that have ownership of the act.  There are several benefits of
collaborating in this manner, each author only has to worry about one or
two acts.  They do not need or even want to know the exact details of the
other acts as long as the other acts follow the general story line.  This
method of collaboration is very simple and requires very little external
support.

In the strong collaboration method each author would work on each act of
the play.  The four acts of the play could initially be given to different
authors, but when an author sees that they can contribute to an act they
would make the suggestion or change to the existing act.  Each author would
work on all four acts.  There would be no way to assign ownership of an act
to a single author since all of the authors provided input to the act.  In
this way, all of the authors participate in the building of the entire
play.  Strong collaboration requires each of the authors to be aware of the
current state of each of the acts.  If an author is working on act 1 and
this effects act 3 then the first author should be able to change act 3 or
at least tell the author who is working on act 3 of the changes.  An author
can have an inspiration about another act and make the changes or
suggestions to that other act.  Strong collaboration requires more
interaction between the authors.  There is a lot of overhead with strong
collaboration.  It normally occurs (though not always) in non-computer
mediated, face-to-face contexts such as a group software design session or
an interactive classroom setting. 

Characteristics of strong collaboration are collective authoring,
collective learning, and collective ownership. In other words, during the
process of strong collaboration, each participant is both contributing to
the construction of the artifact, and gaining new knowledge as a direct
result of this construction.  The constructed artifact is not simply a
patchwork of individual contributions, but instead an incremental, emergent
synthesis that reflects the knowledge created by the group as a whole.
