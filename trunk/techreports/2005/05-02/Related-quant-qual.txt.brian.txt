\subsection{Integrating qualitative and quantitative data}

A major goal of this solicitation is the development of tools for the
integration of qualitative and quantitative data. These tools should
facilitate the sharing of data from diverse sources among a larger
community of investigators. To explain our approach to this problem, we
begin with some basic definitions.

By qualitative data, we mean text, images, and other materials that have
symbolic meaning for some cultural group. Qualitative data comes in many
different forms, from structured interviews, to life history narratives, to
full blown cultural ethnography.  The data are often textual, but may
include graphics, audio or video, as well as clothing, architecture, and
other cultural artifacts. Broadly speaking, qualitative research is used to
explore and document systems of meaning \cite{Feldman95}.

By quantitative data, we mean numbers: interval, ratio or ordinal measures,
including counts or frequencies of occurrence of objects or events, as well
as the variable properties of those objects or events.  For example, one
might count the number of people on a team, or the number of tasks they
perform per unit time. One might also measure their average tenure in their
current jobs.  In the domain of software engineering, typical quantitative
data might include the number of lines of code (LOC) in a software module,
or the number of modules in a system. Quantitative data always has an
explicit or implicit time dimension: it quantifies something at a given
point or interval in time.

Of course, numbers do not speak for themselves. Like qualitative data, they
derive meaning from context.  For example, is 5 defects per 1000 lines of
code high or low? Is a $100,000 error in a financial statement
``material'' or not?  While numbers seem objective, qualitative data is
essential to making sense of quantitative data.  The great strength of
qualitative research is its ability to introduce context into the study of
a particular phenomenon.  From the beginning of the research process
(research design, access to research sites, data gathering) to the end
(analysis, writing and publication) qualitative research both necessitates
and enables attention to context.

{\bf Systems of meaning.}  Meaning arises from context.  For example, an
image of the Buddha may symbolize enlightenment to one group, but may be
meaningless (or have negative meaning) to another group.  In general, a
given text or image has different meanings in different cultural
contexts. Indexical expressions illocutionary speech acts \cite{Brown83}
further complicate the picture.  Even within a particular cultural group,
their meaning depends on the specific situation in which they are
uttered. Because of these considerations, literal (``context-free'')
interpretation of data is misleading.  Scholars have developed techniques
for eliciting systems of meaning by using various ways of categorizing
\cite{Huberman84} \cite{Spradley79} or through the use of metatheories such
as ethnomethodology or semiotics \cite{Feldman95} or rhetoric
\cite{Feldman04}.

In the analysis of qualitative data, there are always at least two systems
of meaning in play: that of the subjects being studied (the
``participants'', sometimes called ``natives'' or
``insiders''), and that of the researchers, who have a theoretical
framework.  The participant perspective is referred to as ``emic'',
while the researcher perspective is called ``emic''
\cite{headland90}. Within an organization, there may be several different
``insider'' perspectives, as well \cite{Martin92}.  For these reasons,
understanding context is a critical concern for the interpretation of any
data, quantative or otherwise \cite{Feldman95}.


{\bf Narrative and meaning.}  People, including researchers, often make
sense of the world and their place in it through narrative form
\cite{Bruner90} \cite{Gee86} \cite{Reissman93} \cite{Mishler86}
\cite{Abbott91} \cite{White80} \cite{Ricoeur81}.  Narrative provides
context; it reveals what is significant to people about various practices,
ideas, places, and/or symbols \cite{Young96}.  Thus narrative structure
provides an analytical framework with specific and transferable categories
that also allows us to connect the actions and events with the meaning(s)
that these actions have for the people who take them \cite{Bal}.  In our
research plan, we propose to combine narrative structure with network
analysis so that we can map multiple possible stories and the many ways in
which an action is implicated in these stories.

{\bf Qualitative analysis tools.} Computer software has the potential to
aid in data analysis \cite{Weitzman95}. Code-based tools (such as ATLAS.ti,
MAXqda, N6, NVivo, and Qualrus), in particular, allow users to connect
meanings implicit or explicit in the context with the textual data. Some of
these tools, such as ETHNO, as particularly suited to the analysis of
narrative data.  These tools help to speed analysis without disconnecting
the data from the context more than is necessary.  By contrast, text
retrievers and text managers (such as QDAMiner, CISAID, Text Mining for
Clementine, from SPSS) encourage the disconnection of the data from the
context.  This kind of program can tell us that a particular text uses the
word ``bridge'' 13 times, but not that sometimes the word refers to a
physical structure, sometimes to a game and sometimes to way of connecting
two ideas.  Further, these tools generally support a small team of
researchers working with a relatively small set of data (e.g., a set of
interviews or fieldnotes).  While extremely well suited to this
application, it is not clear how these tools would scale up to larger
communities of researchers sharing and re-using more diverse sets of
qualitative and quantitative data.

{\bf How can we get the story behind the numbers?}  One challenge in this
project can be thought of as getting the story behind the numbers, or
putting the numbers in context.  Recent innovations in sociological methods
use concepts from narrative theory to integrate qualitative and
quantitative data \cite{abbott91} \cite{abbott95} \cite{griffin93} .

Quantitative data is most commonly used in variance-based models, such as
regression, structural equation modeling, event history, and so on.  In the
familiar regression framework, we create a model of the form Y = f(X),
which posits a functional relationship between a set of antecedents (x1,
x2, x3?, xn) to a set of outcomes (y1, y2, y3? ym).  Since all the
variables can be expressed with numbers, we can use covariance-based
methods to estimate the relationships and test their statistical
significance.
		
In variance models, causal mechanisms are usually implicit.  There is
growing interest in understanding the mechanisms that connect antecedents
and outcomes \cite{Abbott91} \cite{Lawrence97} \cite{griffin93}.  Abbott
\cite{Abbott91} articulates a more inclusive framework that begins with the
patterns of events or actions. Rather than filling in the causal mechanism
later, Abbott suggests that we begin with the patterns of actions that
connect important antecedents and outcomes.  In this way, we can open the
``black box'' that characterizes much organizational research
\cite{Lawrence97}.

Except in rare circumstances, it is not feasible to analyze these
underlying, connective processes; time, expense, complexity and privacy all
present barriers.  But the increased digitization of work processes creates
an opportunity now to begin doing so in a wide range of organizational
settings.  Our approach capitalizes on this potential by supporting the
analysis of processes and patterns of action.

{\bf String matching methods for qualitative data.}  This family of methods
depends on coding qualitative events and searching for patterns. Abbott
pioneered this method \cite{Abbott83} \cite{Abbott90a} \cite{Abbott90b}; it
has been successfully application in a broad range of situations
\cite{Abbott95} \cite{Sabherwal93}. Events are coded as symbols (for
example, actions in a work process \cite{Pentland2003b}). Using techniques
developed in molecular biology for the analysis of genetic sequences,
sequential patterns can be compared and clustered.  The method applies
quantitative methods to qualitative data.  It is limited, however, because
the patterns must be sequential (linear).  While this is a reasonable model
for many phenomena, it is not adequate for many organizational processes
which occur in parallel (more or less simultaneously, in distributed
settings) \cite{pentland05}

{\bf Event structure analysis.} Narrative models form the foundation of
Event structure analysis (ESA) \cite{heise89} \cite{corsaro90}
\cite{griffin93} \cite{griffin94}.  ESA provides a methodology for
interpreting events captured in ethnographic fieldnotes in terms of
coherent patterns.  It has been applied to a variety of situations,
including cultural routines \cite{corsaro90} and organizational change
processes \cite{Stevenson03} \cite{Stevenson98} \cite{Stevenson00}. The
software application ETHNO was developed to support ESA. ESA embodies a
rich conceptual vocabulary for analyzing events as narrative, but the tools
to support it are limited to relatively modest sets of data and an
individual, or small group, of researchers.

{\bf Narrative networks and narrative analysis.}  Abell \cite{abell87}
\cite{abell84}explores the epistemological foundations of modeling social
actions using network representations, such as directed graphs.  He
provides formal models of social processes where each node represents an
action or event.  These models can be summarized in matrix form, or
displayed as a directed graph.  Network models, in the form of Markov
transition matrices, have also been used to represent interaction processes
\cite{Hewes79} \cite{Gottman90} \cite{Pentland2003}.  These models build on
the structural models of narrative originated by Propp \cite{Propp28} and
Todorov \cite{Todorov81}.  Pentland \cite{pentland1999b} provides a
conceptual framework the use of narrative data in the analysis of
organizational processes. These techniques work well for small examples;
scaling to larger sets of data is one of the key challenges we face in the
current proposal.

{\bf Qualitative data as a basis for social networks} The idea of using
qualitative data as the basis for quantitative analysis has considerable
legitimacy in mainstream organizational research.  For example, in one of
the most widely cited papers in organizational studies, Barley
\cite{barley86} used participant observation to record events in a
radiological department.  He analyzed those events in terms of the sequence
(patterns) of interaction among department members to understand the effect
of new technology (computer tomography) on work relationships.  Barley
\cite{barley90} later used the same data to construct and analyze social
networks using standard sociometric techniques \cite{wasserman94}.
Similarly, Pentland uses qualitative data from archival sources to analyze
patterns and construct social networks \cite{pentland1999a}
\cite{pentland03a}.  Olsen et al \cite{olson94} apply a similar methodology
to the analysis of group decision making.

{\bf Extended application of network models.}  The most common form of
social network analysis involves relations between people
\cite{Wasserman94}, but there are many other applications of this basic
technique.  Carley \cite{Carley97} builds on the basic idea of a semantic
network \cite{Sowa84} to analyze the conceptual content of texts. She
develops a ``socioconceptual network'', which she analyzes with
standard sociometric techniques, such as density and connectivity.
``Cause maps,'' or maps of organizational members’ causal beliefs, also
employ network models \cite{NelsonMatthews91} \cite{Bougon77}. These models
are especially helpful for qualitative analysis because they allow the
analyst to interpret the meaning of a particular concept or event in the
context of other, related concepts or events.

Czarniawska \cite{Czarniawska97} uses the concept of ``action nets'' to
describe social institutions and provides a compelling account of the
significance of these networks, but stops short of providing a clear way to
operationalize the concept in research.  Pentland \cite{pentland99a} offers
a methodology that takes narrative fragments (events) and organizes them
into a network that can be analyzed using traditional sociometric
techniques \cite{Wasserman94}.

{\bf Hackystat} Hackystat \cite{Johnson} incorporates an enormous
innovation our capacity to collect qualitative and quantitative data about
organizational processes.  Traditional participant observers, such as
Feldman, Pentland and Barley, are constrained to be in one place at a time;
their understanding of what is going on is inherently bounded by their
point of view \cite{feldman05}.  In contrast, Hackystat allows the
researcher to be everywhere at once.  Data can be collected automatically
and unobstrusively or by prompting participants for qualitative input.

Hackystat data is collected in what Hayden White \cite{White80} would call
a ``chronicle'' ? a sequential list of things that happened.  Each
entry in the Hackystat database can be understood as a ``narrative
fragment'' that includes who, what, when, and perhaps some information
about how or why. Naturally, Hackystat can also collect and store
quantitative information, such as lines of code (LOC).  In a sense,
Hackystat records are like raw fieldnotes ? they record what happened.  The
challenge is to interpret this data -- to pull out the narrative threads
that make it meaningful for the participants and for the researchers.  The
problem is that chronological order does not necessarily imply causal
relations \cite{Griffin93}.

{\bf Automated parsing and recognition.}  Many new sources of narrative
data are becoming available, as well, for a wide variety of phenomena.  In
addition to the many corporate computing systems that generate event and
process data, there are innovations in many branches of social science that
deserve mention.  For example, the Kansas Event Data System (KEDS) offers a
set of tools automated text coding and analysis (www.ku.edu/~keds/). By
parsing newswire articles, researchers have developed a database of
political events for the Middle East, the Balkans, and other geographical
regions. The software automatically codes articles based on topic, main
actors, locations, events, and timing.  The success of the parsing depends
on the relatively structured nature of the source material.  Research on
digital libraries and archives has produced range of tools for the indexing
and retrieval of audio and visual materials. These tools add keywords and
other meta-data to digital media.  For example, in research for the
National Gallery of the Spoken Word (www.ngsw.org), researchers are using
hidden markov models (HMM) for speaker-independent keyword recognition.
Tools are becoming available to help users to find, segment, annotate and
organize streaming media found on the Internet (e.g., ``Media Matrix''
www.matrix.msu.edu/digital.php).

{\bf Summary} While good tools exist for the analysis of small sets of
qualitative data, there is little support for larger sets of qualitative
data, and little support for the integration of qualitative and
quantitative data.

One key challenge in integrating qualitative and quantitative data will be
to reconnect data with context to allow meaningful interpretation.  Finding
ways to link data together as not just plausible but also meaningful is the
challenge.  Moreover, the interpretation of these data must make sense to
the people who were taking the actions (the ``emic'' view) not just to
someone looking on from the outside (the ``etic'' view)
\cite{headland90}.  This is made all the more complicated by the fact that
in many if not most instances one action is likely to have multiple
meanings \cite{Bourdieu77} \cite{Feldman05}.
