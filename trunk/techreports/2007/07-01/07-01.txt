Due date:
February 5, 2007

Proposal text regarding the "Special category":

As the third solicitation in the Science of Design program, we look forward
in the near future to the effective application of SoD research outcomes to
the design of practical software-intensive systems and to the integration
of the generated design knowledge into educational curricula. Thus, in
addition to basic SoD research proposals as described above, we encourage
researchers to submit proposals in two special categories.

      Demonstration Testbeds: Members of the Science of Design research
      community need to be able to show that their research results, as
      embodied in software artifacts, have utility and quality in
      practice. A potential SoD project could therefore perform research to
      build and maintain a design demonstration test bed to support
      research infrastructures on which the results from other projects
      could be implemented and evaluated.

Basic outline:

1. Introduction
-Overview of science of design research process
-Motivation for empirical testbed
-Nontraditional: Non-team based, non "innovative"

2. Requirements for an effective demonstration testbed
- comparable data
- simplified replication
- meta-analysis
- cross-project comparison
- process conformance
- infrastructure leverage
- benchmark design problems.
- data types: process, product, runtime behavior, maintenance.

3. Hackystat
- overview: system, sensors, experiment manager
- case study: TDD, including hongbing's graph (from IEEE paper)
- case study: Vic's HPCS stuff, including experimental framework

4. Project proposal
- Webinar: introduce system
- solicit requirements from SoD community
  - sensors
  - analyses
- create common/competing operational definitions
- public repository and/or private servers
- facilitate training, support,
- privacy issues.
