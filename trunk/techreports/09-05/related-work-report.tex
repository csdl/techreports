\begin{abstract}
The Personal Environmental Tracker (PET) is a proposed system for helping people to track their impact on the environment via data collected from sensors, and to make changes to reduce that impact, creating a personal feedback loop. This document presents a review of the work related to this research program, including: environmental research, economic factors regarding energy efficiency, methods of providing feedback on energy usage, motivating users to change their behavior, suggestions for the design of persuasive environmental systems, a review of related systems, and the calculation of carbon emissions.
