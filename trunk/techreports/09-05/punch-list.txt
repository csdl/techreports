Lit review punch list:

* [PAU] Include graph from LBNL utility website
* [PAU] Include picture of Thighmaster
* Screen shot:
	- [PAU] StepGreen
	- [PAU] Virtual Polar Bear
	- iamgreen
	- PEIR
	- mobGAS
	- Personal Kyoto
	- EcoIsland
* Synthesis table of related systems
	- Include whether/how each could be leveraged by PET
* Synthesis table of sensors
* [PAU] Move reading list to new document
* Start prioritizing/winnowing reading list
* Once conceptual framework is done, move some refs into single sentence refs

* Exploring metrics in PET:
		"The NYT had an interesting article in the "Ideas" issue about using Gallons per 10,000 miles rather than MPG, because the impact of going from something like 10 MPG to 15 MPG is actually much greater than going from 30 MPG to 50 MPG.
		
		This is actually an interesting observation about metrics in general.  One has to be very careful about the units.  Maybe this is something PET could explicitly explore."

* Secret Sauces:
	- "Tailorability #1:  Support "micro-environments".  In other words, a UH dorm user would be provided with a different site that is specialized to their situation. A Honolulu condo dweller would have a different site.  And so forth."
	- "Tailorability #2:  Enable users to both contribute new actions and change the measurement criteria to reflect its relative importance.  The idea here is to stimulate discussion about the relative merits of actions. The discussion would not be "meaningless", because (for example) the site participants could collectively vote on and decide what weight to attach"
