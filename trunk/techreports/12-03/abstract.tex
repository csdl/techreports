Sustainability education has become an international imperative due to the rising cost of energy, increasing scarcity of natural resource and irresponsible environmental practices. Games have been shown to have great potentials in provide engaging interfaces for various serious contexts. My research seeks to investigate how to build a customizable serious game engine for sustainability called Makahiki. This work is motivated by the encouraging results of the inaugural residence hall energy competition at the University of Hawaii in Fall 2011. Makahiki is intended to provide a production quality, pluggable component-based open source game engine and an experimental test bed for game-related research in the context of sustainability education and conservation.
