%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
%!NOTE: This example file has been prepared according to the University of
%!      Hawaii Style & Policy Manual for Theses and Dissertations dated
%!      "Revised February 1998". If you have one with a later date, you may
%!      need to make revisions to this document as well. In any event, making
%!      sure your thesis complies with Graduate Division guidelines is
%!      ultimately your responsibility. Caveat LaTeXtor. :)
%!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

%% The options are (you can only choose one from each group):
%%
%% 10pt, 11pt, 12pt: chooses the point size for the document. "11pt" is the
%%                   default.
%%
%% oneside, twoside: whether you want your document onesided or twosided. Note
%%                   that twosided is not guaranteed to work, and style
%%                   guidelines prohibit double sided printouts on final
%%                   copy. "oneside" is the default.
%%
%% draft, final: when printing drafts you can save a lot of paper by using the
%%               "draft" option. It switches to single spacing, displays overful
%%               hboxes with a black box, prints a version number on title page 
%%               and omits signature page. Of course for the final copy make
%%               sure to use the "final" option! "final" is the default.
%%
%% cm, times, palatino, newcent, bookman: switches between different font
%%                                        sets. "cm" is the Computer Modern
%%                                        font (TeX's default), the rest are
%%                                        PostScript fonts. "times" is the
%%                                        default.
%%
%% thesis, dissertation: switches between the style for a master's thesis and a 
%%                       Ph.D. dissertation. The differences are fairly minor
%%                       and limited to the front matter. "thesis" is the
%%                       default.
%%
%% actual, proposal: switches between actual document and proposal mode. In
%%                   proposal mode: the title page is simplified, the
%%                   version number is always printed, and the signature page
%%                   is omitted.
%%
%%% Load the uhthesis2e document class
\documentclass[11pt,final,times,dissertation,proposal]{uhthesis2e}
%\documentclass[11pt,draft,times,dissertation,proposal]{uhthesis2e}

%% hyperref package complains if this isn't here. Might be unneeded when
%% I switch to the new UH thesis style
\paperheight = 11in

%%% Load some useful packages:
%% New LaTeX2e graphics support
\usepackage{graphicx}
%%	using final option to force graphics to be included even in draft mode
%\usepackage[final]{graphicx}
%% Tell graphicx the default directory for all figures
\graphicspath{{figures/final/}}

%% Enable subfigure support
\usepackage{subfigure}

%% Make subsubsections numbered and included in ToC
\setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
\setcounter{tocdepth}{3}

%% Package to linebreak URLs in a sane manner.
\usepackage{url}

%% Define a new 'smallurl' style for the package that will use a smaller font.
\makeatletter
\def\url@smallurlstyle{%
  \@ifundefined{selectfont}{\def\UrlFont{\sf}}{\def\UrlFont{\small\ttfamily}}}
\makeatother
%% Now actually use the newly defined style.
\urlstyle{smallurl}

%% Define 'tinyurl' style for even smaller URLs (such as in tables)
\makeatletter
\def\url@tinyurlstyle{%
  \@ifundefined{selectfont}{\def\UrlFont{\sf}}{\def\UrlFont{\scriptsize\ttfamily}}}
\makeatother

%% Provides additional functionality for tabular environments
\usepackage{array}

%% Set up to create an index
\usepackage{makeidx} 
\makeindex

%% Puts space after macros, unless followed by punctuation
\usepackage{xspace}

\newcommand{\COtwo}{CO\ensuremath{_2}\xspace}
%% Hawai`i with okina
\newcommand{\Hawaii}{Hawai`i\xspace}
%% Manoa with kahako
\newcommand{\Manoa}{M\=anoa\xspace}

%% Provides customization of lists
\usepackage{enumitem}

%% Now define question list type
\newlist{question}{enumerate}{1}
\setlist[question]{resume, label=\textbf{\arabic*.}}

%% Define multiple choice answer list type
\newlist{answer}{enumerate}{1}
\setlist[answer]{label=\alph*)}

%% Allows insertion of fixme notes for future work
%% Note, remove status=draft when printing final version!
\usepackage[footnote, nomargin, status=draft]{fixme}
% turned off marginclue because it generates hbox overflows for each note :(
%\usepackage[footnote, nomargin, marginclue, status=draft]{fixme}

%% Make URLs clickable
\usepackage[colorlinks, citecolor=blue, bookmarks=false]{hyperref}
%\usepackage[colorlinks, citecolor=blue, bookmarks=true, backref]{hyperref}

%% Make links to captions point to the figure, not just the caption at bottom
\usepackage[all]{hypcap}

%% Set up to create a glossary
%\usepackage[toc]{glossaries}
%\makeglossaries

%% Since I'm using the LaTeX Makefile that uses dvips, I need this
%% package to make URLs break nicely
\usepackage{breakurl}

% correct bad hyphenation here
\hyphenation{strong-ly}

%%% End of preamble
\begin{document}

%%% Declarations for Front Matter. Capitalize all of these values

Daniel D. Suthers\\
Anthony Kuh}
%% This is the total size of your committee, including the chairperson. The

%% The field in which you are obtaining your degree, capitalized normally.
\field{Computer Science}
%% The version number of your document. Consistent use of this will enable you
%% to tell old drafts from new ones. Final actual documents omit this
%% automatically so you can use it without fear of submission problems at the
%% end. If you do not define this parameter, it defaults to "1.0.0".
