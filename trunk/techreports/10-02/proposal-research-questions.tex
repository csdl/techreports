\section{Research Questions}

\begin{itemize}

\item How can dormitory residents be motivated to reduce their electricity usage?

\item How sustainable are any electricity usage reductions after the study is complete?

\item What activities are most helpful in improving participants' energy literacy?

\item How much does a real-time electricity display help a dorm to achieve electricity conservation?

\item How well do Kukui Nut scores correlate with post-test energy literacy?

\end{itemize}


\section{Hypotheses}

\begin{itemize}

\item Participants with Kukui Nut scores will have higher and more improved post-test energy literacy scores.

\item Improving residents' energy literacy will lead to sustained electricity conservation.

\item Floors with large electricity conservation during the competition period but with low energy literacy scores post-test will have greater rebound effect than floors with higher energy literacy scores post-test.

\item Residents that complete more activities (as specified by the competition website) will improve their energy literacy more than residents that do not participate.

\end{itemize}
