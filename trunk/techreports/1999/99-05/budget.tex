\section{Project Budget}
%No more than 1 page

The project budget is essentially one item: a server which will be used to
distribute MCS and to store MCS-maintained mailing list archives. It will also
be required as a workstation for myself when performing editing, system
maintenance, project development tasks.

Most of the following pricing information was obtained from the Apple Store for
Education \url{<http://store.apple.com/Catalog/US/Images/routingPage.html/>}.
The pricing for Mac OS X Server (the operating system for this server) is not
yet finalized. It should be available in the month of February 1999, well in
advance of the April 1 expected award date. There may be small variations in
the price of the equipment when the order is actually placed due to bundling
offers from Apple, etc. Microsoft Office 98 can be obtained from the UH
Bookstore.
