\title{Aspect Technology Fund Grant Proposal:\\Condensation of Educational
Mailing Lists}
\author{Robert S. Brewer\\Collaborative Software Development Lab\\University of 
Hawaii at Manoa}

\date{February 1, 1999}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  I propose the extension of the Mailinglist Condensation System to the realm
  of class support mailing lists in education. Condensed archives of the
  mailing lists can be used by future students to learn from the students of
  previous semesters, instead of having the information thrown out at the end
  of each semester. I will pursue this by piloting the system on two classes in
  Fall 1999. Furthermore, I show the feasibility of creating a company based on
  the {\em open source} model which will sell service and support for MCS.
