<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "introduction">Introduction</a></h2>    
<p>

LOCC is a general mechanism for producing one or more measurements of the
size of work products. LOCC has stood at various times for "Lines of Code
Counter", "Line-Oriented Counter Compiler", and "Lots Of Content
Counter". We solicit your input on other expansions of this acronym.  LOCC
can produce both the "total" size of a work product, as well as the
"difference" in size between successive versions of the same work product.

<p>

LOCC currently supports size measurement of ASCII text and Java source
code.  LOCC is extensible by virtue of its reliance on <A
HREF="http://www.suntest.com/JavaCC/">JavaCC</A> to generate a parser for
the work product, along with standard interfaces to traverse parse trees for
particular work product instances to produce size information.  We intend
to enhance LOCC to support size measurement of C++ in the near future, 
and support for other languages may follow.

<p>

LOCC can produce "hierarchical" size measurements.  For example, in a Java
program, one might measure size in terms of the number of packages,
classes, methods, and lines of non-comment source code per method.  These
measures are hierarchical, in the sense that by keeping track of the
membership of methods to classes, and classes to package, one can compute
the lines of code per method, per class, and per package.  Such hierarchies
are ubiquitous in modern programming languages, but also occur in other
work products as well. For example, one hierarchical size measurement of a
technical report might be number of chapters, number of sections, number of
subsections, number of paragraphs, number of lines per paragraph, and
number of words per line.

<p>

There are many applications of size measurement, and the intended
application greatly influences how size is defined and counted.  LOCC is
designed to facilitate size measurement by individuals of their own work
products for the purpose of planning and estimation.  For example, if a
correlation between size and effort can be established on prior work
products, then by estimating the size of a work product in the planning
stage, an estimate of the amount of effort can be calculated through linear
regression, along with a predication interval. (See "A Discipline for
Software Engineering", Watts Humphrey, Addison-Wesley, 1995, for a detailed
discussion of this approach to size estimation.)  LOCC is also designed
to serve as instrumentation for research into size measurement for the 
purposes of estimation and planning by individuals.

<p>

Hierarchical size measurement is quite useful in individual planning and
estimation, since it is not clear <em>a priori</em> which among the number
of lines, number of methods, number of classes, or even number of packages
will correlate best with effort.  By producing a hierarchical size
measurement, LOCC allows the planner to investigate all of these
size measures simultaneously and choose the one which appears best
suited to the context. 

<p>

LOCC's reliance on a grammar to parse the work product means that LOCC does
not suffer from several design limitations of its predecessor system, <A
HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/JavaCount/JavaCount.html">JavaCount</A>.
Unlike JavaCount, which required programmers to format their source code in
a specific manner, LOCC will successfully parse and produce size measures
for source code regardless of its layout.  However, it should be noted that
in order for size measures to be used successfully for planning and
estimation, individual programmers should take care to layout their code in
a <em>consistent</em> manner across projects so that the size measures
obtained are comparable.

<p>
The next sections document the installation, GUI interface, and 
command line interface to the system.

<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "installation">Installation</a></h2>    


To install LOCC, point your web browser at: <A
HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/LOCC/LOCC.html">http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/LOCC/LOCC.html</A>.
From this page, you can access an InstallAnywhere script that downloads the
LOCC application and installs a double clickable icon to invoke the GUI
interface.  A command line interface is also provided, and invocation
by command line is illustrated in a batch file distributed with the system.
<p>



<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "LOCCgui">LOCC Graphical User Interface</a></h2>    

After double clicking on the LOCC icon (or selecting "LOCC" from the Start
menu in Windows), the following window appears:

<p>
<img src="screen1.gif">
<p>

As the screen above illustrates, there are two tabbed panels from which to
choose.  The "Total" panel is used to generate size measures of one or more
files.  The "Diff" panel is used to generate an "incremental" size by
comparing the total sizes of two files.

<p><hr><p><h3><A NAME = "LOCCguiTotal">LOCC Total</a></h3>    

<p>

The window showing the LOCC Total GUI interface is displayed above. First,
the user must select the files to be counted.  Pushing the "Add File"
button will pop up a file dialog which can be used to select files to
count.  If a mistake is made, the "Remove All" button will remove all
currently selected files.  There is no way at present to remove individual
files.

    <p>
Second, the user must select an output file.  The "Output File"
button can be used to bring up a file dialog, or the file name
can be directly entered into the field.

<p>
<b>IMPORTANT!</b>
<br>
LOCC currently takes a somewhat clumsy approach to handling output files.
When running the Total counting tool, existing output files are clobbered,
i.e. they are truncated to zero length before output is written to them.
The Diff counting tool takes the opposite approach: output to the file is
appended onto the end of the file.  This is admittedly counter intuitive,
but since currently one can only enter a single new/old file pair in the
Diff counting tool, having this tool work in append mode makes sense.  The
Total counting tool can process many files at once, and so it makes sense to
begin with a fresh output file.
<p>
As a matter of pratice, users should generally first run the Total tool,
thereby creating a fresh output file, and then run the Diff tool, appending 
onto the end of the same output file used in the Total tool.  Future
versions of LOCC will eliminate this confusion by allowing the user to
specify output modes for both Total and Diff counting.

    <p>
The doctype and output format must be specified if the default
values are incorrect.  The doctypes currently supported are
"text" and "Java".  The output format can be either "general" or 
"LEAP".

<p>
Third, when all the files have been entered, and doctype and 
output format successfully specified, 
the user presses the "Run" button to start the
system.  The output is placed in the output file.  There is
no way at present to view the output from within the GUI.
<p>

<p><hr><p><h3><A NAME = "LOCCguiTotaluse">LOCC Total Usage Examples</a></h3>    


For example, assume a user has written the following program
and stored it in a file called "HelloWorld.java":

<pre>
// A simple file containing the Hello World program.

import java.io.*;

class HelloWorld {
  public static void main (String [] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
</pre>
<p>

She decides to obtain some "general" information concerning the size of
this program. To do this, she brings up LOCC and specifies the input file as
"HelloWorld.java" and the output file as "HelloWorld.locc":

<p>
<img src="screen2.gif">
<p>

After pressing "Run", LOCC produces the following
and writes it to HelloWorld.locc:

<pre>
Java Source: HelloWorld.java (6)
Number of Classes: 1
Number of Interfaces: 0
Number of Methods: 1
Package: 
 Class: HelloWorld (5)
1 Method(s):
  Method: main (3)
</pre>
<p>

This file indicates that the file HelloWorld contains 6 lines, 
one class, and one method.  The class HelloWorld contains 5
lines.  The method main() with the class HelloWorld contains
3 lines. 

<p>
Alternatively, the user might desire size information on her
"HelloWorld" program in a format appropriate for input into the 
Leap toolkit.  To do this, she selects "Leap" as the doctype,
and changes the file name as illustrated next:

<p>
<img src="screen3.gif">
<p>

After pressing "Run", LOCC produces the following
and writes it to HelloWorld.leap:

<pre>

</pre>

As you can see, Leap files use a modified format of HTML to represent size
data, and represent the same size information in a slightly different
manner than the "general" format shown previously. 
<p>

First, the HelloWorld.leap file begins with a Size Definition Table (SDT), which
specifies the kind of hierarchical size measure that is used for
the following size data. This hierarchical size measure indicates
that information about size at the grain sizes of lines, methods, classes,
and packages.

<p>

The second table contains the actual size data, and has three
entries. The first entry specifies that the main() method in
the HelloWorld class consists of three lines. The second
entry specifies that the HelloWorld class contains two lines not
present in any method. The third entry specifies that the
HelloWorld.java file contains 1 line not contained in any method,
class, or package. 

<p>

The Leap size data representation language is somewhat complicated, and
the preceding discussion gives you only a taste of what's involved.
For more details on Leap size representations and the toolkit that
manipulates it, you should consult its home page at
<A
HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/LEAP/LEAP.html">http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/LEAP/LEAP.html</A>.


<p><hr><p><h3><A NAME = "LOCCguiDiff">LOCC Diff</a></h3>    


The Diff panel is used to calculate the "difference" between two 
successive versions of a file---in other words, the number of new
and changed lines.  The Diff panel looks like this:

<p>
<img src="screen4.gif">
<p>

The "Old File" and "New File" buttons bring up dialogs to select 
the old and new files, or the names can be directly entered into 
the fields.  The output file must also be specified.  The
doctype and output format are selected as described above.  
<p>

<p><hr><p><h3><A NAME = "LOCCguiDiffuse">LOCC Diff Usage Examples</a></h3>    


<h4>Modifications within methods</h4>

As a first example, assume that our user has modified her HelloWorld 
program to print out a different message. She saves the 
old HelloWorld.java as HelloWorld.java.old, and the new file
as HelloWorld.java:

<pre>
// An updated simple file containing the Hello World program.

import java.io.*;

class HelloWorld {
  public static void main (String [] args) {
    System.out.println("Bonjour Le Monde!");
    System.out.println("Comment ca va?");
  }
}
</pre>
<p>

She would now like to determine, not the total size of this program,
but rather a measure of the size of the changes to the 
HelloWorld program required to produce HelloWorld2.  To do this,
she brings up the Diff panel and specifies the two files she wishes
to compare and the output file where she would like the results 
placed:

<p>
<img src="screen5.gif">
<p>

Pressing the Run button produces the following file:

<pre>
Size Difference info for HelloWorld.java
2 lines added in method main
0 lines added in class HelloWorld
0 lines added in package 
</pre>


Note that "added" can also be interpreted as "added or modified".
Alternatively, the user could request that the differences between
these two files be produced in LEAP format.  The Leap output for
this difference again indicates that exactly two lines were
added.

&lt;/table&gt;

</pre>


<h4>Modifications to method names</h4>

Sometimes LOCC produces an unintuitive (you might less charitably view it as
"incorrect") answer.  For example, consider a situation in which the 
user decides to change the original HelloWorld program by changing both
the main() method and the class name, so that the new program can
be stored in a different file:

<pre>
// An even more updated simple file containing the Hello World program.
// Saved to the file HelloWorld2

import java.io.*;

class HelloWorld2 {
  public static void main (String [] args) {
    System.out.println("Bonjour Le Monde!");
    System.out.println("Est-ce que ca va bien?");
  }
}
</pre>

We might now want to do a diff between our most recent
HelloWorld.java and this new HelloWorld2.java.  Note that
we've only changed two lines: the line containing the 
class name and the second println statement.  However,
LOCC does not appear to agree with us:

<pre>
Size Difference info for HelloWorld2.java
6 lines added in class HelloWorld2
0 lines added in package 
</pre>

Why does LOCC think that HelloWorld2 added six lines when we know that we
only modified 2? The reason is because LOCC diffs Java code by comparing
the code on a class by class and method by method basis.  In other
words, LOCC tries to diff HelloWorld.java with HelloWorld2.java by 
finding the class HelloWorld in the first file, then looking for 
that same class in the second file.  In the first example we considered
previously, LOCC
is able to find the same class (HelloWorld) in both files 
(HelloWorld.java.old and HelloWorld.java).  However, in this second
example, LOCC can't
find the class HelloWorld in the new file because it was renamed to HelloWorld2.
So, LOCC reports that an entirely new class containing six lines is added
to the new file HelloWorld2. 

<p>

Counting and differencing size on a unit by unit basis is
highly advantageous in many circumstances, but its achilles heel is
the situation in which the user modifies the actual class names and/or
method names in a file.  In situations like this, LOCC will basically
provide an "inflated" value for the amount of code changed, because
by changing the name of the method or class, you guarantee that the
entire method or class will be counted as new size regardless of how
much you changed inside. 


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "LOCCcli">LOCC Command Line Interface (CLI)</a></h2>    

The command line interface is more cumbersome, but enables
the LOCC tool to be invoked automatically by other tools. 
It also allows the output of LOCC to be printed directly
to the standard output, which is not currently supported
by the GUI interface. 

<p><hr><p><h3><A NAME = "LOCCcliTotal">LOCC Total CLI</a></h3>    


First, your CLASSPATH must be set so as to include the LOCC
jar file.  Then, invoking LOCC Total from the command line
is accomplished as follows:
    <p>
<code>java csdl.java.locc.sys.LOCTotal [ arguments ] </code>

<p>
The command line arguments supported are

<p>
<ul>
<li>
	<em>-sizetype [ javaline | textline ]</em>
	<p>
	  the <em>sizetype</em> argument informs the system what sort
	  of files are being processed and how to go about counting the
	  files.  The currently supported sizetypes are <em>javaline</em>
	  and <em>textline</em>, which do line based counts of Java source
	  and ASCII text, respectively.  There is no default, and this
	  argument must be specified.
	<p>
<li>
	<em>-infiles FILE ...</em>
	<p>
	  the <em>infiles</em> argument specifies a list of files to
	  process.  This argument may appear more than once on the
	  command line.
	<p>
<li>
	<em>-indir DIR EXT</em>
	<p>
	  the <em>indir</em> argument is used to process all the files 
	  in directory DIR with the extension EXT.  The extenstion is
	  a literal string, not a wildcard pattern.  So to match java
	  source files, use the extenstion ".java".  This argument may 
	  appear more than once on the command line, and may appear in 
	  conjunction with the <em>infiles</em> argument.
	<p>
<li>
	<em>-outdir DIR</em>
	<p>
	  the <em>outdir</em> argument instructs the system to place
	  output in the specified directory.  The default is the
	  current working directory.
	<p>
<li>
	<em>-outfile FILE</em>
	<p>
	  the <em>outfile</em> argument specifies the name of the file 
	  in which to place output.  If this argument is not
	  specified, output will be directed to distinct files, one
	  for each input file.  The names of these files will be the
	  name of the input file with ".siz" appended.  This argument
	  is orthoganal to the <em>outdir</em> argument.
	<p>
<li>
	<em>-outformat [ general | leap ]</em>
	<p>
	  the <em>outformat</em> argument specifies the format used in 
	  producing the output.  Each sizetype supports some number of
	  output formats.  The currently supported formats are
	  "general", which produces human readable summaries, and
	  "leap" which produces HTML tables, suitable for loading into 
	  LEAP tools.  The default is "general".
	<p>
<li>
	<em>-help</em>
	<p>
	  print a short help message.
	<p>
    </ul>
