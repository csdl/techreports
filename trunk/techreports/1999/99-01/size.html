<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "Motivation">Motivation for size
measurement</a></h2>

Why attempt to measure the size of work products?  Simply put, because
tracking one or more measures of "size" can provide enormous
insight into your activities as a developer, regardless of whether the work
product you are developing is code or some other structured document such
as a test plan, requirements specification, user guide, powerpoint
presentation, and so forth.

<p>

One way that size can provide insight is by providing an indication of
progress toward completion of a certain phase of development.  For example,
suppose that you have determined during initial planning and design that
the size of an object-oriented system will be 32 classes. If 8 classes
have been implemented so far, then you might infer that you are approximately 25%
of the way through implementation. On the other hand, you might also have
determined during design that these same classes consist of 160 methods,
and the 8 classes implemented so far contain 80 methods.  Using methods
rather than classes as your size measure, you would now infer that you are 50%
of the way through implementation.  Yet a third estimate of implementation
completion could be calculated by using lines of code as the size measure,
and comparing the planned total lines of code to the actual lines of code
implemented thus far.

<p>

The ability to calculate multiple, possibly differing estimates of progress
toward completion is actually a strength of this method, not a weakness.
For example, if all three measures resulted in an estimates of completion
that ranged between 45% and 55%, then you might feel reasonably confident
that you are about halfway through implementation.  On the other hand, if
the three estimates ranged from 15% to 80%, then you might feel
considerably less confident of your actual progress toward completion,
unless you could account for the disparity. (For example, you might have
one very large class and four small helper classes, and implement the
helper classes first. In this case, progress based upon implemented classes
would lead to an estimate of 80% completion, which of course would be
unrealistically high.)

<p>

A second way you can use size is to provide insight into development rate,
which is the size of a work product divided by the time required to build
it. For example, my development rate on the initial draft of a chapter of
this user guide was approximately 400 words per hour.  As before, different
size measures can lead to different values of development rate---other
possible development rates for this same chapter were 0.8 sections per
hour, and 1.1 printed pages per hour.

<p>

Development rate is often referred to as "productivity", so we will
sometimes use this term, even though "productivity" is somewhat misleading.
The problem with this term is that most people think that "high
productivity" is always preferable to "low productivity".  However, it is
usually possible to achieve very high productivity by sacrificing
quality. I could probably double my development rate on this user guide,
and thus my "productivity", by simply typing as fast as possible and not
worrying at all about whether I spell words correctly or structure my
sentences and paragraphs to make sense to the reader.  But this high level
of "productivity" would not result in a usable work product.  

<p>

Development rate can be quite useful during planning. For example, I
discovered that my development rate on the initial draft of the first
several chapters of this user guide varied between 350 and 580 words per
hour.  When planning a new chapter, I estimated that it would require about
about 6000 words. Using my prior development rates, I could thus estimate
that the initial draft of the chapter would require between 10 and 17 hours
to write. (You will learn later about more sophisticated approaches to time
estimation, but this example gives you the basic idea and may be quite
sufficient in many contexts.)

<p>

Development rate can also be useful for providing insight into your
development "efficiency"---in other words, your development rate when
combined with other factors such as quality and usability.  For example, I
hope that over time, as I become more experienced with the writing of user
guide chapters, I will become more efficient, and be able to improve my
development rate without sacrificing quality.  The goal of the Leap toolkit
is to provide you (and me) with mechanisms and supportive infrastructure
that enable us to replace blind "hope" for improved efficiency with
concrete approaches.

<p>


A third way to use size is to provide insight into the frequency of
occurrence (i.e. density) of certain characteristics within a work product.
For example, a popular characteristic to measure is defect density: the
number of defects divided by the size of the work product.  For example, if
a review discovers 14 major defects in a software module, then if the
module contained 7 classes, the observed defect density could be calculated
as 2 major defects per class.  (Defects per method and defects per thousand
lines of code (KLOC) and so forth are also common density measures.)

<p>

Tracking changes in the density of certain types of defects can be a useful
mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of changes to the development
process.  For example, assume that a development group is having
significant problems with null pointer exceptions escaping into released
code. To combat this problem, they institute checklists and reviews in an
attempt to prevent this kind of defect from escaping into their public
releases.  Tracking the density of occurrence of this defect over a few
projects can help the team discover both if the reviews and checklists are
effective in finding these defects, and if the customers are reporting this
type of problem less.  

<p>

Of course, measuring size in order to be able to calculate density isn't
absolutely necessary for tracking defects.  In the above situation, one
could have instead simply tracked the total number of reported null pointer
exceptions over time without regard to the size of the systems
involved. However, this can lead to misleading results.  For example,
assume that the total number of reported defects went from 100 in January
to 50 in February to 25 in March. Looks like our checklists and reviews are
having quite a positive impact, right?  Well, now let's factor in size, and
assume that 10,000 lines of new code were released in January, but only
5,000 lines of new code were released in February, and only 2,500 lines of
new code were released in March. Thus, while the total number of observed
null pointer defects in released code decreased substantially from January
to March, the null pointer defect density actually stayed the same.  The
addition of size to "normalize" the defect data helps to reveal that the
addition of reviews and checklists were not nearly as effective as the
defect data alone might indicate.

<p>

In summary, size measurement has a number of useful applications in the
development of work products, from tracking progress, to planning and
estimation, to evaluating the effectiveness of changes to development
procedures.  However, measurement and application of size is not
straightforward---we have already seen that there is more than one way to
size a system (classes, methods, and lines for software, chapters,
sections, words for technical documents, etc.), and that certain
applications of size measures can be uninteresting or even counter
productive (i.e. the pursuit of higher development rates without regard to
quality or other important factors). The next section introduces some
important characteristics of size measures that are implemented in
Leap. Subsequent sections introduce Leap tools for representing size,
followed by manual, then automated size measurement examples. 


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "Characteristics">Useful characteristics of size measures</a></h2>

In order to understand how Leap represents and manipulates work product
size, you must be familiar with three important concepts: hierarchical
size measures, multiple size measures, and incremental size measurement.

<h3><A NAME = "Hierarchical">Hierarchical size measures</a></h3>

A hierarchical size measure is one which allows you to talk about size
using a set of different, yet related levels of perspective, or "grain
sizes".  For example, my "size" as a person could be represented
hierarchically as height in yards (1.92), height in feet (5.92), and height
in inches (71).  The primary characteristic of a hierarchical size measure
in Leap is that there is some way to aggregate values from a measure at one
grain size to yield the measure at the next grain size.  In this case, you
can aggregate each 12 inches of my height to yield my height in feet, and
each three feet of my height to yield my height in yards.  An example of a
non-hierarchical set of size measures for me is: height in feet, weight in
pounds, and volume in cubic inches.

<p>

In Java programming, one hierarchy of measures is lines, methods, classes,
and packages.  Each line can be aggregated with one or more others to
represent the size of a single method, each method can be aggregated with
one or more others to represent the size of a single class, and so forth.
In technical report writing, one hierarchy of measures is lines,
paragraphs, sections, chapters.

<p>

Another important characteristic of a hierarchical size measure in Leap is
that each object at each grain size has a unique membership to an object at
the next higher grain size. For example, each line in Java program can be
uniquely associated with one and only one method. Each method can be
associated with one and only one class. In the realm of tech reports, each
word of text can be associated with one and only one paragraph, each
paragraph can be associated with one and only one section, and so forth.
You can visualize this as a tree structure.  Interestingly, some
"hypertext" work products can violate this characteristic, in that a
certain section, for example, might be associated with multiple
chapters. In these cases, you'd have to determine some way to assign a
"primary" chapter to each section for the purpose of size measurement using
Leap.

<p>

Note that a single size measure grain size is, by definition, hierarchical.  So, 
a size measure consisting only of height in feet is a valid hierarchical
size measure.  A size measure consisting only of weight in pounds is 
a valid hierarchical size measure.  Which neatly brings us to the 
next concept, multiple size measures.

<h3><A NAME = "Multiple">Multiple size measures</a></h3>


For some objects, there exist multiple, complementary, but 
essentially independent representations of size.  As you saw above, 
valid indications of my "size" could be height, weight, and 
volume, and there is no direct way to convert my size as a height 
into my size as a weight similar to the way you can convert my
size as a height in inches into my size as a height in feet.

<p>

Many work products can also have multiple, independent size measures. For
example, in Java, you can measure size in lines of code, and you can also
measure size in function points. These two measures are not hierarchical
(each line of code is not necessarily associated with one and only one
function point), and in fact there is no straightforward way to convert a
size in lines of code to a size in function points or vice-versa. (There
are some methodologies for "back-firing" lines of code to function points,
but these are approximations and their validity is contested. Function
points were invented, in large part, as an independent size measure not
suffering from the problems associated with lines of code.)

<p>

<h3><A NAME = "Incremental">Incremental size measures</a></h3>

The final concept is the incremental nature of size measurement.  Much of
the time, you don't start with a "blank screen." Instead, you start with an
initial version of the work product and enhance and correct it.  To
accomodate this situation, Leap size measures should be "incremental". In
other words, a Leap size measure should allow you to take two
versions of a work product and determine how much "new size" has been added
during the current project.

<p>

Calculating the "incremental" size of a work product is very difficult to
do precisely, and necessitates certain trade-offs.  To understand why this
is so, you must first recall why you calculate size in the first place.  As
noted in the first section of this chapter, size is useful for (among other
things), tracking progress, planning and estimation, and evaluating the
effectiveness of changes to development procedures.  In most of these
cases, a given work product size is intended to correlate with "amount of
work accomplished."  In the case of building a work product from 
scratch, this relationship is often easy to establish: you started with
nothing, you build a 30 page technical report, so the "work you have 
accomplished" is 30 pages worth of technical report. 

<p>

Now, however, assume that you start with a 30 page technical report, and
then you work on it for a week, and the result is a (much improved) 28 page
technical report!  How do you properly indicate the "amount of work
accomplished" during this week?  On the one hand, you don't want to just
use the total document size of 28 pages, since this does not take into
account the fact that you started with a 30 page document, and presumably
re-used much of it.  On the other hand, you don't want to simply subtract
the two values, since -2 doesn't even make sense as a size.

<p>

In Leap, the basic approach is to perform a "difference" operation on the
two documents. Let's say that the original 30 page technical report
consists of 1000 lines, which are organized into 100 paragraphs, which are
in turn organized into 10 sections.  After working for a week, you invoke a
software tool that takes the original and revised version of the technical
report, and compares their two structures. This program compares the two
documents line by line, and somehow determines how many lines changed in
each paragraph, if any.  It also associates each changed paragraph with its
section.  As a result of this program's effort, it is now possible to
figure out how many lines, paragraphs, and sections you changed during your
week of work. This kind of "difference" seems a much more reasonable
representation for the amount of work accomplished in an "incremental"
context.

<p>

Incremental size measurement is hard, and Leap's difference approach is
not without problems. First, we will often need a program to do this
differencing for us--for large work products, it will be way too much
effort and too error-prone to do by hand. Second, there are certain
"implementation details" that need answering---for example, do you
represent the work required to <em>delete</em> sections of a work product,
and is this work equivalent to that required to <em>add</em> (or modify) an
equivalent amount of work product?  Leap doesn't require that you decide on
these implementation details in only one way, though the approach does
require that you stay consistent across work products so that the
results are comparable. 
<p>

We have embodied one set of answers to
these implementation details in a software system called <A
HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/LOCC/LOCC.html">LOCC</A>, which will
be discussed in more detail later in this chapter.  For now, it is enough
to understand the need for incremental size counting and the utility of
some sort of difference-based mechanism to address this need.

<p>

A third problem with incremental size measurement is management of the
resulting data in Leap. To make this concrete, let's return to the tech
report example. Assume that you want to record Leap data on your work on
the initial 30 page version of the tech report. To do this, you would
define a project (named, for example, "Leap User Guide, Size Chapter"), and
record the time you spend, the defects you make, and of course the size of
the tech report that results from this effort.  Now, assume that several
months later, a new release of the system requires you to make some major
updates to this document.  You would like this to be a separate project
(named, for example, "Leap-6.5.4 Size Chapter Updates").  Now, you need to
enter into Leap the new size difference data and distinguish it from the
old size data <em>even though the size data was generated from the exact
same file at different times!</em> In other words, file names alone are not
sufficient in Leap to associate size data with projects, because two
different projects can have size data based upon the same file as it
existed at different points in time.  To resolve this problem, Leap
requires you to specify the start time and end time for each project and
the files included in it. Leap also requires that each size entry include
the name of the file and a timestamp representing when the size data was
collected.  Leap uses this information to "match" projects with their
size data. Several examples of this in the next section
should make the process clear. 


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "Leap">Size measurement in Leap using Aama,
Iole, and Ilio</a></h2>

Hopefully, you are now comfortable with three important reasons
<em>why</em> size measurement is useful (for tracking progress, for
planning and estimation, and for evaluating the effectiveness of changes to
development procedures). You are also hopefully comfortable with three
useful <em>characteristics</em> of size measures supported in Leap
(hierarchical, multiple, and incremental).  If these ideas sound foreign to
you, then you obviously skipped to this section without reading the first
parts of this chapter!  Well, if this is you, then either go back to the
beginning of this chapter right now or else read on at your peril, because I
will assume you understand these reasons and characteristics in the
following discussion.

<p>

Leap splits the task of size representation between two tools: Iole and
Aama. (Iole is the Hawaiian word for the Hawaiian Rat, and Aama is
the Hawaiian word for the Hawaiian Black Crab.) Aama allows you to 
define individual size measures (such as a measure for Java source
code, or techreports, or Powerpoint presentations), while Iole is
used to enter size data about specific work products (such as 
the Foo Version 2.3 software system, or techreport csdl-99-01). Leap
uses the Project definition tool, Ilio, to connect size data to 
specific projects and thus other data such as time and defects.

<p>
To fully understand size representation in Leap, it helps to break
the complexity down into a number of different scenarios.  We'll
start with the simplest first.


<p><h3><A NAME = "Size1">Simple size measurement</a></h3>


This first scenario presents a very simple situation of
size measurement.  Let's assume that you have a project 
called Project1 that produces a document called p1.html,
and you want to record its size in kilobytes. To accomplish
this, you need to define a size measure, a project, and 
a size entry.  Let's first look at the size measure 
definition as shown in the Aama tool:

<p>
<img src="screens/size-aama1.gif">
<p>

In this case, the size measure definition is very simple. The name
of the size measure is "FileSize", it applies to documents of type
"TechReport", and the units are KBytes. Next, let's look at the 
project definition as shown in the Ilio tool:

<p>
<p>
<img src="screens/size-ilio1.gif">
<p>

Here, we see that the project name is "Project1", and that it is associated
with only one work product, called "p1.html", which is located in the
directory "c:\techreports".  (Note that the syntax of the FileList field
supports wild cards and multiple file specifications, although this
is not shown in this example. The extended syntax is
covered in detail in the chapter on Project definition. Finally, note
that you actually use the Hee tool to define a project. Once you 
press "Update" within Hee, the data will appear within Ilio as shown above.)
<p>

It is also important to note the start and stop times: Project1
started on April 1 and ended on April 15.  Now, let's finally look
at the actual size entry as shown in the Iole tool:

<p>
<img src="screens/size-iole1.gif">
<p>

This size entry was generated on April 15, and records a size
using the FileSize size definition.  The path of the work product
is "c:\techreports", the file is "p1.html", and the number of 
KBytes in the work product is 332.

<p>

Now, notice that the "Project" field is filled with "Project1", but that
this field is italicized.  In Leap, field values in italics mean that the
field is automatically calculated from other data and cannot be entered
directly by the user.  Thus, Leap automatically assigns projects to
size entry data.  Understanding this assignment process is crucial
to avoiding intense frustration when using size data in Leap, and 
so the next section discusses this important issue in detail.


<p><h3><A NAME = "ProjectAssignment">Interlude: How Leap assigns the project field of size entries</a></h3>

How does Leap assign the project field of an individual size entry?  In
general, Leap associates a size entry with a project when all of the
following are true:

<ol>
<li> The path and file for the size entry matches the FileList
specification associated with the project.
<li> The date for the size entry falls within the start and end dates
associated with the project.
<li> The date for the size entry indicates that this is the most recent
size entry for the given SizeType, Path, and File that still falls
within the start and end dates associated with the project.
</ol>

In the example presented in the previous section, all of these constraints
happened to be satisfied.  In this section, to make these constraints more
clear, I will violate each of them and show you what happens. First, here's
what happens if I change the name of the file from "p1.html" to "p2.html"
(and tab out of the field so that Leap sees the change):

<p>
<img src="screens/size-iole2.gif">
<p>

Notice that the Project field is now blank, indicating that this size
entry is no longer associated with any project.
<p>

To violate the second constraint, I'll change the file name back to
p1.html, but change the date the size entry was generated to March 15:

<p>
<img src="screens/size-iole3.gif">
<p>

Once again, the Project field is blank, because now the size data was
generated prior to the start time of the Project.  Start and end times are
actually tricky, because although the Date is <em>displayed</em> showing
only the month, day, and year, it is stored internally as a timestamp that
includes seconds, hours, and so forth.  Thus, if your size entry was
generated at 12:00 noon on April 1, 1999, but your project ended at 11:55am
on April 1, 1999, the size entry will not be associated with the project,
even though both fields say "4/1/1999".  If you confront this situation,
simply tab into the date fields whereupon the full timestamp will be
displayed.

<p>
The third constraint is designed to allow you to enter size data during the
project for analysis, and use only the latest set of data for the current
analysis.  For example, let's say you calculate and enter the size of your
p1.html work product once a week.  The third constraint ensures that only
the most recent size entry data of type FileSize will be used within the
time frame of the project. The following screen illustrates this constraint
in action:

<p>
<img src="screens/size-iole4.gif">
<p>

Let's look at each of these entries in turn. The first entry, on
3/22/99, is not included in Project1 because its date falls
before the start date of Project1, which is 4/1/99.  The 
second entry, on 4/4/99, does fall within the Project1 time
period, but is not included because there is a later time 
entry from 4/9/99 for the same file that falls within the 
Project1 time period.  This entry, from 4/9/99, is assigned
to Project1.  Finally, the last entry from 4/17/99 falls 
after the Project1 end date (4/15/99), so it is also not
assigned to Project1. 

<p><h3><A NAME = "Size2">Single, hierarchical size measurement</a></h3>

Let's now look at a simple example of hierarchical measurement. 
First, we need to define a hierarchical size measure, so we'll
add the following "WordSize" measure as shown in Aama:

<p>
<img src="screens/size-aama2.gif">
<p>

Unlike FileSize, this measure is truly hierarchical because we have more
than one "level" or grain size to measure.  Now, let's see what 
some actual hierarchical size data looks like:

<p>
<img src="screens/size-iole5.gif">
<p>

There are several interesting things to note about this example.  First,
you can see that we now have four entries associated with Project1. How
did we get four entries to <em>simultaneously</em> satisfy the three
constraints for assignment to Project1?  Before solving this assignment
puzzle, let's first discuss exactly what this hierarchical size measure
actually means and motivate why we want all of these four entries 
to be assigned
to Project1.

<p>

In every hierarchical measure, the First Level provides the "units" value
for the measure. In the case of WordSize, the "units" value is "Words".
Unlike our previous measure, FileSize, the WordSize measure also includes a
second level called "Section".  This second level represents an aggregation
of first level units.  When a size measure is defined with a second level,
such as "Section", then each size entry represents the size associated with
a single instance of the <em>second</em> level section.  So, in the case of
the p1.html work product, the size entries indicate that this work product
consists of four sections, named "1.0", "1.1", "2.0", and "3.0".  These
sections contain 678, 458, 1,234, and and 3,451 words respectively.  The
total size of p1.html in words at the time of Project1 is thus the total of
all of the WordSize entries, or 5821 words. 

<p>

In summary, with "true" hierarchical size measures---those with more than
just the units measure defined---the overall size of the work product must
be represented as a <em>set</em> of size entries, one for each aggregation
listed in the "Second Level".  The total size of the work product for a
project is calculated as the sum of the units value (which should always be
a positive integer, incidentally).

<p>

Now that you understand why we need to provide multiple size entries, let's
solve the project assignment puzzler.  The issue is with constraint (3),
which says that only the most recently timestamped entry for a given work
product and Size Type will be associated with the matching project.  In our
current example, we have four entries for the same work product and Size
Type, so how did we get them all to be "most recently timestamped"? The
simple answer is to provide them all with <em>identical</em> timestamps!
If the timestamps had differed by even a single second, then only the most
recent entry would have been used.  Since they were all identical, all of
them were used.  (When entering values manually into Iole, the easiest way
to obtain identical timestamps is to select an entire timestamp from one
entry, copy it, and then paste it into all of the other entries.)

<p>

A common misconception with hierarchical size measures is that you can
express the entire size of a work product in a single size entry. For
example, novice Leap users often try to create a size entry like this:

<p>
<img src="screens/size-iole6.gif">
<p>

Here, the user is attempting incorrectly 
to represent the idea that p1.html has a total size
of 5,821 words which is divided somehow among 4 sections.  But this
is not how Leap interprets this entry. Instead, Leap interprets this
entry as p1.html consisting of a single section named "4" with 
5,821 words in that section. 

<p>

The Leap representation for hierarchical size entries can result in the
requirement for many size entries in order to fully represent complex work
products.  Consider the JavaSize hierarchical definition, which consists of
lines, method, class, and package.  Here is a portion of the size table for
one Java software system, with a few fields hidden for display purposes:

<p>
<img src="screens/size-iole7.gif">
<p>

Notice that since the second level grain size is "method", each method in
the software system has its own entry in the size table, and that the first
level units (lines) indicates its size. The advantage to this
representation is that it is possible to obtain accurate aggregate data,
such as the number of methods, the number of classes, the number of methods
in each class, the number of lines in each class, the number of lines in
each package, and so forth.  The principal disadvantage of this
representation is that the entry of hierarchical size data for complex work
products like software systems virtually requires tool support, such as
LOCC.  

<p>

You might also notice that some of the entries have one or more blank
fields.  This is legal, and is a way to indicate "loose" size at one or
more levels of aggregation.  For example, in Java there can be lines of
code not contained within any method in a class (for example, declarations
of instance variables).  LOCC counts these lines and creates a size entry
for them containing a blank method field.  Similarly, in Java there can be
lines of code not contained within any particular class (such as the import
statement). LOCC counts these lines and creates a size entry with a blank
method and blank class fields.  (Strictly speaking, what really happens is
that LOCC defines a new method with a "blank" name and a new class with a
"blank" name to hold this size data.)


<p><h3><A NAME = "Size3">Multiple, hierarchical size measurement</a></h3>

Having seen simple measurement, and hierarchical measurement, let's 
now look at multiple size measurement.  Recall that multiple size
measurement is the ability to represent the size of a work product
using more than one size measure definition.  This is quite simple

In this screen, we return to our prior techreport example, and simply
include both the FileSize and the WordSize entries. 
Note that since the first size entry is of a different size type than
the remaining four, its assignment to a project is performed 
entirely independently.  Thus, entries of type FileSize don't have
to have the same time stamp as entries of type WordSize in order
to be assigned to the same project.

<p><h3><A NAME = "Size4">Incremental, hierarchical size measurement</a></h3>

The final situation to address is incremental size representation.  You
might be approaching this section with dread, given the prior lengthy
discussion on multiple and hierarchical size measures, since 
incremental size measurement is so much more complicated than 
multiple and hierarchical size measurement. 

<p>

Well, at last there is some good news.  There are no new concepts to
introduce in order to understand incremental size measurement.  In fact,
<em>Leap does not distinguish between a "total" size and an "incremental"
size</em>!  This is an important point: Leap assumes that the size data it
loads correctly represents the amount of "size added" during a particular
project.  If, for example, a project starts from scratch, then it is up to
the user to invoke a tool that computes the total size of the work product
and stores the resulting size entries in a file for loading into Leap.  If,
on the other hand, a project starts with an initial version of a work
product and enhances it in some way, then it is up to the user to invoke a
tool that compares the original version to the new version, computes the
incremental size, and stores the resulting size entries in a file for
loading into Leap.  LOCC is an example tool that provides two interfaces,
one for computing total sizes of work products, an done for computing
differences between two work products. 

<p>

Incidentally, once you start needing incremental size measurement,
you quickly recognize the advantage to requiring a separate size
entry for each second level aggregation (such as methods in JavaSize). 
This advantage is the ability to easily represent exactly which 
methods, classes, and packages you "touched" during a particular
project. 

<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "Hints">Hints for size measurement</a></h2>

Here are some helpful rules of thumb for size measurement:

<ul>
<p><li> <em>Avoid manual measurement and entry of hierarchical size measures.</em> We
have found that in almost all cases, it is too difficult to
manually measure and enter hierarchical size measures (in other
words, size measures that contain more than just a first level
name in the Aama). In the preceding discussion, for example,
the "FileSize" measure would be appropriate for manual 
measurement and entry, but the WordSize and JavaSize measures
would require automated support.  

<p><li><em>Formatting guidelines may often be needed to ensure consistent
size measurement across work products.</em>  For example, consider
a technical report size measure definition that counts lines.  If
some technical reports break lines after 60 characters and some 
break lines after 80 characters (or, equivalently, set the 
margins differently), then differences in the measured size may not
accurately reflect differences in the "true" size of the document.
This can also be true for source code.

<p><li><em>Don't include commas when entering first level unit values!</em> 
Due to a bogosity in a third party tool used in Iole, you must enter a four
digit size value like "5,234" as "5234" without any commas, even
though the comma is added as soon as you tab out of the field.
</ul>
  

<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "Assign">Diagnosing problems in assigning
size entries to projects</a></h2>

Many Leap users have occasional problems getting Leap to assign a 
size entry to the correct project.  If you are having this problem,
here is a procedure that you can use to diagnose why the assignment
is not being made:

<ol>
<p><li> Check to make sure that the timestamp of the size entry is 
between the start and stop timestamps of the project. Note that
Leap records dates down to the second, so you will have to physically
click into each of the three fields to perform this check.

<p><li> Check to make sure that the path and file name of the 
size entry matches against the FileList of the project.  Note
that Leap performs this matching process via a textual comparison
and does not resolve aliases, shortcuts, or symbolic links. In
general, avoid the use of aliases, shortcuts, and symbolic links
in Leap, or else be sure to use them consistently.

<p><li> Check to make sure that this entry is the most recent 
entry in Iole of a given size type and path/file name.  Leap
only includes the most recent entry.  If you want multiple 
entries with the same path/file name and size type to be
associated with a project (which is the typical case in 
hierarchical size measurement), then you need to make sure
that each of these size entries has an <em>identical</em> date timestamp. 
Tools such as LOCC generate identical timestamps for all size
entries during a given run.  If you are entering size entries
by hand, you'll need to copy and paste the date field to obtain
an identical timestamp.
