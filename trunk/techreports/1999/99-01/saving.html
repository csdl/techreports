<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "motivation">Motivation</a></h2>

The first question you may be asking yourself is, "Why manage Leap data at
all?"  Why not simply provide a backend database to perform all storage
management for the Leap system?

<p>

The question is a fair one.  In fact, at some point in the future, it is
quite likely that we (or some other sufficiently perturbed user) will
implement a database backend to Leap.  The Leap architecture is designed to
make it relatively simple to "swap in" a database to replace our current
ASCII file-based approach.  And, to be honest, the use of a database
backend would eliminate certain data management cruftiness present in the
ASCII file-based data management scheme.  However, the current
implementation of Leap eschews a database management system for the
following reasons:

<ul>
<p><li> <em>ASCII files are free and cross-platform.</em> A 
database solution to data management would force us to 
choose either a platform-specific solution (such as Microsoft Access) and/or
a non-free solution (such as an Oracle database).  We feel strongly
that providing a usable implementation of Leap that is 
completely free and cross-platform is 
quite important for its adoption and evaluation. 

<p><li> <em>ASCII files facilitate interoperation.</em> 

For Leap to be adopted, it must be easy to integrate it with other tools
and software development environments. Because Leap data is stored as ASCII
files, the <A
HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/LOCC/LOCC.html">LOCC</A> size
counting tool can easily generate Leap size data, and the <A
HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/Defmacs/Defmacs.html">Defmacs</A>
plugin for Emacs can easily generate Leap defect data. Database systems
tend to store data in proprietary, binary formats. While some database
systems support "import" and "export" ASCII formats, we have decided that
instead of supporting both binary and ASCII formats, we would just go with
ASCII for now. 

<p><li> <em>ASCII files facilitate evolution.</em> Once the infrastructure
was built, it became relatively simple to evolve our data structures
in a backward compatible manner such that old file formats would still
be readable by the system.  Database systems cannot typically 
read in data files built from prior versions of the database schemas. 

<p><li> <em>ASCII files facilitate transparency and inspection.</em> Our
choice of ASCII files was also motivated by our strong desire to make the
data stored by the system easy for users to understand and verify. In
addition, ASCII files facilitates debugging of the system, and the
occasional manual correction of a gorked data file.
</ul>

Given the decision to use ASCII files, the next issue is their
internal structure.  Current Leap data management is influenced
by the following key design decisions:

<ul>
<p><li> <em>Leap data is organized into collections of predefined
types.</em> Leap hardwires a set of primitive types.  This primitive type
set has evolved over time, but it is not user-configurable.  Currently, the
set of predefined types are: defects, times, sizes, projects, doctypes,
defect types, severities, phases, docIDs, size definitions, checklists, and
patterns. Furthermore, instances of each of these predefined types 
are stored together in a collection.  

<p><li><em>Collections of a predefined Leap data type are 
represented in files as a restricted form of HTML table.</em>  
When you look at the contents of a Leap data file, what you'll
find is one or more HTML tables.  For example, here's an
example Leap table representing two effort entries:

<pre>
&lt;table border&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;TRL Plain 2.0.0
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Project&lt;th&gt;Phase&lt;th&gt;DocType&lt;th&gt;Start&lt;th&gt;Stop&lt;th&gt;Interrupt&lt;th&gt;Delta&lt;th&gt;Description
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td type=Project&gt;98-13
&lt;td type=Phase&gt;Planning,0
&lt;td type=DocType&gt;TechReport
&lt;td type=Start&gt;09:19 12/14/1998
&lt;td type=Stop&gt;09:33 12/14/1998
&lt;td type=Interrupt&gt;0
&lt;td type=Delta&gt;14
&lt;td type=Description&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td type=Project&gt;98-13
&lt;td type=Phase&gt;Initial draft,2
&lt;td type=DocType&gt;TechReport
&lt;td type=Start&gt;09:38 12/14/1998
&lt;td type=Stop&gt;10:06 12/14/1998
&lt;td type=Interrupt&gt;0
&lt;td type=Delta&gt;28
&lt;td type=Description&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</pre>


Thus, if you open a Leap data file within a Web browser, it will display as
one or more formatted tables. However, only HTML tables formatted in a very
specific way can be read by the Leap parser---you can't simply create a
table in Netscape and expect Leap to read it.  The <A
HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/LEAP/dev_info/leap-file-format.html">Leap
File Format</A> document specifies the precise syntax for legal Leap data
files.(Yes, for the markup language cognoscenti out there, XML might be a
better choice, but so far HTML has worked out just fine for our relatively
simple application domain.)

<p>

You can see from this example that each table is identified as being of a
specific type (the above example table is of type "TRL Plain") and has a
version number for that type (this above version is "2.0.0".) Each HTML row
contains a single Leap data object and the "type" tag is used for
documentation purposes to specify what value is provided in each field of
the row.

<p><li><em>A Leap data file can contain one or more tables, and 
multiple tables of the same type can be included in a single file.</em>
Each Leap table contains a collection of Leap data objects of a single
type.  Thus, for a file to contain, for example, project definitions
plus time entries plus size entries, it would need to include
three Leap tables.  Furthermore, it is perfectly acceptable to 
construct a Leap data file containing 2 or more tables of the same
type. 


<p><li><em>Order of entries within a Leap table is unimportant, 
and the order of tables within a Leap file is unimportant.</em>
This design decision is important for enabling data to be loaded
and saved in an efficient and relatively simple fashion. 


</ul>

So, in summary, Leap data management is file-based, and each file contains
one or more HTML tables, where each table holds instances of a single Leap
data object, of which there are currently 13.  

<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "organizing">Organizing your Leap files</a></h2>

As the preceding discussion reveals, Leap provides a great deal
of flexibility with respect to how you organize your Leap data
into files.  This section discusses some alternative organizations
of your Leap data into files and the advantages and disadvantages
of each.  Many "hybrid" approaches that combine one or more
of the following schemes are also possible, and we encourage
you to experiment to find the approach that best fits your needs.

<p>

In the following discussion, I will sometimes refer to example
file names, such as "definitions.leap".  However, it is important
to note that Leap does not care about the file name chosen. 
You could name your Leap data file "myfile.doc" and it would
load just fine into Leap as long as it was an ASCII file 
obeying the Leap file format specifications. 

<h3><A NAME = "allinone">All in one</a></h3>

The simplest approach to Leap data organization is to keep all of your Leap
data in one single file.  The advantage to this approach is that all of
your Leap data is available to you all of the time by simply loading a
single file.  If you are just starting to use Leap, we encourage
you to consider this organization for your first couple of projects.
There are two primary disadvantages to this organization:
<ul>

<P><li> Over time, the amount of Leap data can grow to be large.   It will get
cumbersome to have Naia display by default all of the time data for every
day for every project for the past year, or Honu to display by default
every defect you've ever recorded, for example. We call this the
"ballooning data" problem.

<p><li> The pure "all in one" organization does not allow groups who use
Leap to share certain Leap "definition" data in common.  For example,
groups who use Leap for review can benefit from a shared data file
containing a project definition for the review, the definitions of all
defect types, the checklist items to be used, and so forth.  This data is
logically separate (and politically and socially separate) from the data
accumulated by individuals on the time they spend on review, for example.
</ul>

<h3><A NAME = "defs">Separate definitions and primary data</a></h3>

The "separate definitions and primary data" approach solves the second
disadvantage of "all in one".  In this approach, you store most or all of
the Leap "definition" data (i.e., the Leap data under the "Definitions"
menu in the Leap Toolkit window) in a single file, such as
"definitions.leap".  You store all of your "primary" Leap data (i.e., size,
time, and defects, found under the "Data" menu) in a separate file, such as
"data.leap".  This approach has the advantage of enabling a group to share
and enhance a common "definitions.leap" file yet keep their own time, size,
and defect data to themselves. It is also convenient in the sense that
definitional Leap data does not tend to become very large in size, nor does
it change extremely fast (except for an initial period of development when
it does tend to evolve rapidly).
<p>

A simple extension of this approach is to have two levels of definitions
files: a common definitions file used by the entire group, and a personal
definitions file used by you alone.  This allows a group to specify, for
example, some "basic" defect type categories for review, yet allow
individuals to extend these initial categories with defect types of
particular use to their own circumstances.  

<p>

There are two disadvantages to the "separate definitions and primary data" approach:

<ul>
<P><li> It still does not solve the "ballooning data" problem of the "all
in one" approach: over time, the amount of Leap data that you collect is
going to grow large, and this applies to your "data.leap" file.

<p><li> The "definitions.leap" file will contain "condensation" data,
which provides summary information about the defects, sizes, times,
and other information related to a project. (Project condensation
is covered in detail in the chapter on 
<A HREF="projects.html">Introduction to Leap Projects</A>.) 
Sharing files between
people containing projects that have been condensed can unwittingly
reveal (at least in aggregate form) personal Leap data that the
individual may have wished to keep private.  Furthermore, if a 
file containing project definitions is shared and two people 
condense it, it is possible to for the second user to "clobber" the 
condensation of the first user. 
<p>

As a general rule, therefore, if you have a file containing project
definitions for shared use, you should not use the condensation feature
on those projects unless you ensure that all of the members of the 
group are aware that the file is being used to maintain condensed 
data.

</ul>


<h3><A NAME = "functional">Functional organization</a></h3>

Another useful file management strategy is to place Leap data
related to different functional activities into different files. 
For example, I currently maintain all of my Leap data related to 
technical report production in one file, and all of my Leap data
related to programming in a separate file.  Since these two
types of activities have little overlap with respect to size types, 
defect management, planning, and estimation, it is helpful to 
keep them separate. 

The primary disadvantage of a functional organization is when
you interleave activities related to both types of projects during
your daily course of events.  With a strict functional separation,
this would result in your effort data being accumulated in two 
separate files.  This simply means that both files would need to
be loaded before you could determine aggregate values such as
the amount of direct time you spend across all functional areas. 
An alternative approach would be to keep all time data in one
file, and a functional decomposition for the remaining Leap data.


<h3><A NAME = "rolling">Rolling organization</a></h3>

Yet another approach is to maintain a file of Leap data collected
for a given month, then "roll over" to a new file approximately once
a month.  This strategy can work well when combined with the 
"definitions plus data" approach, so that you maintain a consistent
set of definitions, and roll over only the "data" file once a month.

<h3><A NAME = "projects">Projects-only mixin</a></h3>

"Mixin" is ancient hacker terminology going back to the 
days of Lisp machines and the Flavors object oriented system.
It refers to an approach that can be "mixed in" as a 
grace note to another primary approach, similar to the way 
Steve's Ice Cream parlor in Cambridge, Massachusetts 
began providing customers with the ability to "mix in" 
diced candies and chocolates into their ice cream in the 
mid-1970's.  The designers of the Flavors system used to 
frequent Steve's ice cream shop and added the concept of
"mixin" as an explicit language feature. 

<p>

Well, enough reminiscing; back to the '90s and Leap. The Projects-only
mixin is a Leap data file management approach that can supplement the
approaches mentioned above, and which can begin to deal with the
"ballooning data" problem.  The basic idea is to separate out your project
data from your other definition data, typically by putting it into a single
file.
<p>

Why does this help?  The answer has to do with the motivation for
condensation.  We recognized early in the development of Leap that while
detailed data on individual defects, sizes, and times can be extremely
useful for gaining insight in current and recently completed projects, this
sheer mass of this data would become overwhelming over months or years of
Leap usage.  For older projects, and in order to scale the system, one
solution would be a "condensed" version of the defect, time, and size data
associated with a given project.  For example, instead of complete details
about each individual defect, including its description, fix time, and so
forth, the "condensation" of a project includes only aggregate defect
information, such as the number of defects injected and removed during each
phase, the average density of defects, and so forth.  Instead of
maintaining a record of each individual effort entry, the condensation of a
project includes only aggregate effort such as that devoted to each phase
and overall effort for the project. Size data is similarly aggregated.
Leap stores this "condensation" of the data associated with a project in a
special field associated with each project entry. (This field is normally
hidden, but which can be displayed via the <A
HREF="tables.html#hide">hide/show menu</A>. It is saved in an encoded, not
very human-readable ASCII format.)  Furthermore, Leap does not calculate or
maintain this data implicitly: to create a condensation, you must
explicitly load all of the data associated with a project, then invoke the
"Condense Project" menu item in Ilio, the Project viewer.

<p>

The benefit of a project condensation is that it is a compact
representation of most of the information you need to know about old
projects to support planning, estimation, and trend analysis, and once
you've created a project condensation, you no longer need to load the time,
size, and defect data associated with that project as long as you have the
project entry itself and wish only to perform the analyses included in the
condensation menu.  

<p>

Thus, the "Projects-only mixin" refers to a file containing only a
Project table, where each entry is an "old" project that has been 
condensed after its conclusion.  This mixin allows you to load 
dozens or hundreds of projects into Leap and obtain many useful
analyses without also loading the thousands upon thousands of 
individual time, defect, and size records associated with them.

<h3><A NAME = "export">Project export mixin</a></h3>

Another useful mixin is to create a "Project Export" as you 
complete a project.  The "File" menu in Ilio (the Project
viewer) contains a menu item called "Export project". This
operation allows you to create a new file containing all
of the data from all tables related to a single project.  
This serves as a convenient way to "archive" all Leap data
related to a single project in one place. 

<h3><A NAME = "tips">Tips for Leap data file management</a></h3>

As you can see, Leap provides a potentially bewildering variety of 
approaches to storing your data.  However, most people quickly find
a relatively simple storage scheme that works well for their purposes, 
although we have found within our research group that no one organizes
their Leap data in exactly the same way!  In general, I suggest that 
you be guided by the following general heuristics:

<ul>
<li> Keep it simple at first.  Start by saving everything in a single
file. You can always modify your file management strategy later on if
you need to.  
<li> Don't construct group or organizational "standards" from the 
beginning and attempt to impose them on group members. Let any
"standards" evolve bottom up.  On the other hand, it can be very
useful to provide "template" Leap data files containing definitions
found useful in the organization.
<li> Creating project exports at the end of a project as an archival,
"backup" of your Leap data is highly recommended. 
<li> Remember that Project condensations are manually created and
maintained. If you go back to a project and add any time, size, or
defect data, you will need to rebuild that project's condensation
to integrate the new data.  Also, you'll need to make sure that all
time, size, and defect data for that project is loaded before 
rebuilding the condensation. 
</ul>

<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "semantics">The "semantics" of Saving</a></h2>

As the preceding discussion indicates, Leap allows you to load files
containing multiple tables from multiple sources.  For example, you
might load three files containing project export data, where each
of these three files contains some time data, some defect data,
some size data, and of course various Leap definitions.  Once
this data is loaded, it is organized within Leap by type, so that
all of the time data from all three projects can be viewed within
Naia, all of the defect data from all three projects can be viewed
within Honu, and so forth.  

<p>

When Leap loads a file, it needs to keep track of where each individual
Leap data object in each table came from so that it can save the it back to
file from which it came if the user edits it during this session.
Individual Leap data objects are represented as a row in a Leap table
viewer.  So, for example, if you loaded three files, each containing a
table of defect data, and then edit the description field of one of those
defects, Leap must be able to save that defect entry back to the file from
which it came.  Leap accomplishes this using a special field called
"LeapDataFile" that is associated with each table entry.  This field is
initialized with the file membership of an entry when it loaded.  You can
see this field and its contents using the Hide/Show menu, though it is
hidden by default.  When you create new entries during a Leap session, 
this field is empty. 

<p>

It turns out that this implementation, along with the design constraints
mentionned at the beginning of this chapter, leads to rather subtle
and sometimes unintuitive behavior when saving Leap data.  The following
sections attempt to clarify exactly what happens when Leap data is saved,
and why.

<h3><A NAME = "save">Save</a></h3>


Assume that you've loaded three files, gone into Honu, edited some
old defect entries, added a few new ones, then pressed "Save" in Honu.
What should happen?  Clearly, you want to update the files whose entries
you modified with their new contents, and you also want to save out the
newly created entries to some file.  It is easy to save out the modified
entries, since the LeapDataFile field holds their file membership, but
where should the new entries go?  Leap solves this by providing you with a
pull-down menu as part of the Save dialog box that asks you to specify
where to save the new entries from among the existing files it knows about
in Honu. All new entries are always saved to a single file, and that 
single file must be one of the files already loaded. (In the event that
there are no entries in this table, Leap pops up a file dialog
box allowing you to save the entries out to a new file.)

<p>

As part of writing out these new entries, Leap will write the name of 
the file you selected into each entry's LeapDataFile field.

<p>

While "Save" is invoked from within a specific table-based viewer, its
effect is not necessarily restricted the contents of that single table.
Consider the example above once more.  When we press "Save", we want to
write out all of the files containing defects whose entries have been
modified in Honu.  However, to maintain data integrity, we don't want to
write out <em>just</em> the defect table to that file---we want to write
out a complete update of the modified file, including all of the other
tables that were present in that file originally (and which may have been
subsequently modified in other viewers!)  Thus, even though you invoke
"Save" within Honu, the effect of this operation may be to save changed
data in other tables as well as long as that changed data was loaded from
one of the files that is being saved out by Honu.  In general, you will be
fine if you understand that "Save" is <em>guaranteed</em> to save out only
the changed entries from a single table, but might <em>potentially</em>
save out some other data as well, depending upon the circumstances.


<h3><A NAME = "saveAs">Save As</a></h3>

The "Save As" button, although it appears in several screen dumps,
is no longer supported in Leap. This is because it can result in
loss of data in certain circumstances where multiple files are loaded
into Leap. The safer alternative is to use "Export" to create a 
new copy of the contents of one or more tables. 


<h3><A NAME = "saveTables">Save Tables</a></h3>

Unlike "Save", which is available only from within
table-based viewers such as Honu, Ilio, Naia, etc., the "Save Tables" menu
operation is available from the Leap toolkit window under the File menu.
We located it in the Leap toolkit because it is a "global" save mechanism
that operates across all the tables in the toolkit.  "Save Tables" brings
up a dialog box with entries for all the tables in the system and the files
associated with each of them.  With "Save Tables", you are asked which
tables you would like to save (a table is checked by default if it has been
changed since the last save), and where you would like to place new entries
(which may be an existing file or a new file).

<p>

Like the "Save" mechanism, "Save Tables" requires all entries loaded from
a file to be re-saved out to the same file they came from.  Unlike 
the "Save" mechanism, "Save Tables" allows you to save out all Leap 
data present in the system.


<h3><A NAME = "exportTables">Export Tables</a></h3>

"Export Tables" is also available from the Leap toolkit window 
under the File menu, because it also provides a "global" save
mechanism.  Invoking "Export Tables" brings up a window
enabling the user to specify, for each table, a file to which 
the contents of the table will be written.  

<p>
"Export Tables" does not change the file membership 
of any entries in any of the tables; instead, it makes a new copy of the 
data. 

<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "duplicate">Loading and saving duplicate data</a></h2>


Duplicate data is an important issue that must be addressed in Leap,
given the variety of ways that people can choose to partition their
data among various files.  There are two fundamentally different
duplicate data problems:

<ol>

<li> The problem of duplicate definition data.  This problem occurs, for
example, when you load two exported project files that use the same defect
type definitions.  This would result in two copies of the same defect type
definition in Pueo, the defect type viewer.

<li> The problem of duplicate primary data.  This problem occurs, for
example, when you unwittingly load two copies of the same exported project
file into Leap at once. This would result in twice
as many defects being represented as belonging to that project.

</ol>

Currently, Leap provides a solution to the first problem but doesn't solve
the second.

<p>
Leap solves the first problem by checking, when loading a new 
definitional Leap data object, whether or not the same data object
currently exists in the table.  If so, Leap does not add the new
object, but Leap does add an additional file membership to that object.
Thus, the definition Leap data object now belongs to two files 
simultaneously for the purposes of saving.  If you edit that definition
and press save, both files will be updated. 

<p>

Currently, we know of no general strategy for avoiding the second problem
for defect data.
We can detect and delete duplicate time and size entries. 
We admit that the potential to "double count" defect data is a
potentially serious shortcoming in our file-based mechanism, but we have
found that with a little vigilance, this problem can generally be avoided.
