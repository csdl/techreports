Much of the information in Leap consists of sets of data objects with a
consistent internal structure.  For example, as you use Leap, you typically
accumulate a set of "project" objects, each of which has associated with it
a name, a description, a file set, a start timestamp, and so forth.

<p>

It is convenient and natural to manipulate these sets of objects using
a tabular interface.  So, to manipulate a project instance, you open 
the Ilio tool, which presents you with a table where each row represents a
different project instance, and each column in the table provides access
to the value of a field in that object. By filling out a new row in a
table, you create new instances of these objects. 

<p>

All of the Leap tools that present data objects in a tabular format adhere
to a common "look and feel" and implement several standardized functions in
their interface.  This chapter documents these shared interface mechanisms.
I will refer to this interface as the "Leap table viewer" in order to
clearly distinguish them from the Leap output file format (which is often
referred to as a "Leap table").  The current set of Leap table viewers
includes Honu for defects, Naia for effort, Iole for size data, Ilio
for projects, Puaa for projects, Pueo for defect types, Noio for Severities,
Ulua for phases, Nene for Document IDs, Aama for size definitions, 
Kala for checklists, and Opihi for patterns.  
There are currently two Leap tools that are not table viewers and do not
provide the facilities specified below: Io, the real-time effort recording
tool, and Ahi, the preferences tool.  

The following screen illustrates one of the table-based viewers 
in Leap and annotates many of the 
features to be described in this chapter.


<p>
<img src="screens/tables0.gif" width=100%>
<p>



<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "popup">Popup menus</a></h2>

One useful feature in Leap table viewers is popup menu support for
selecting predefined values.  Many fields in Leap objects refer to other
Leap objects.  For example, the project object has an internal field called
"Phaseset".  Usually, when you use this field in a project entry, you will
want to refer to one of the Phaseset objects you previously defined using
the Ulua tool.  You could simply type in the name of the Phaseset by hand,
but this is slow and there is always the danger that you might mispell or
miscapitalize your entry.  To make this easier, Leap allows you to right
click (or whatever mouse gesture is required for your operating system)
within any field that is normally filled with values from other defined
Leap objects. This right click pops up a menu of all currently defined Leap
objects of that type for you to select from.  In certain cases, the popup
menu is hierarchical. For example, the popup menu for defect types is
hierarchically organized by document type:
<p>
<p>
<img src="screens/tables1.gif" width=100%>
<p>

No fields in Leap <em>require</em> the use of popup menu, because Leap does not
require you to predefine the set of possible values for a field before
you can use it. Any field that provides a popup menu also allows you to
simply type a value into it manually.  This allows you, for example, to 
"try out" a defect type on a few entries before making it a part of the
set of formally defined types.

<p>
Popup menus are dynamically updated. So, for example, if you go to 
the Pueo defect type definition tool and add a new defect type, it
will immediately show up in the popup menu associated with any field
in Leap that takes a defect type. 

<p>
Unfortunately, Leap does not currently provide any visual indication of the
fields providing popup menus.  


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "sorting">Sorting</a></h2>

Leap provides a limited, but useful capability for sorting the entries
(i.e. rows) in a table viewer.  In each table, clicking on the 
column header sorts all of the entries by that field's value.
Leap currently recognizes three data types when sorting: alphabetic,
numeric, and time data. When sorting time data, the most recent
entries appear at the beginning, in other words, the entries are
sorted in reverse chronological order.
<p>
Sorting can be quite useful. For example, consider a situation where
your colleagues are performing a review of a work product you 
have authored. Each reviewer has sent you a Leap data file containing 
defects.  You load each file into Leap and display them using Honu 
as follows:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables2.gif" width=100%>
<p>

However, this results in a display of all the defects by the first
reviewer, followed by all the defects by the second reviewer, and
so forth. It would be far more convenient to sort the data by location
so that you can fix or discuss the defects with one pass through the 
document. Clicking on the "Location" field column header accomplishes
this:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables3.gif" width=100%>
<p>
As you can see by looking at the "Location" field, the defects are
now presented in sorted order by location within the document.


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "filtering">Filtering</a></h2>

Filtering is a simple mechanism to hide certain entries (rows) in a table
based upon the values of one field (column).  Only certain fields support
filtering: these are represented by a Filter icon in the column header that
is intended to resemble a funnel.  See the first screen at the beginning of
this chapter for a pointer to the Filter icon.  When a column header
contains the funnel icon, shift clicking in that column header brings up
the filtering dialog box:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables4.gif">
<p>

The pulldown choice lists allow you to select a single value from 
the current values of the field to match against or to not match
against:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables5.gif">
<p>
 
In this case, the filtering operation will hide all entries 
whose location is not 1-7, and the result is:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables6.gif" width=100%>
<p>

It is important to realize that filtering does not delete any data---it 
simply hides it from view. To show that data again, shift-click to 
bring up the Filter dialog box and press UnFilter.  The above filtering
example is used for fields containing strings; other dialog boxes are 
displayed when filtering based upon numbers or dates. 


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "hide">Hiding and showing columns and rows</a></h2>

Filtering provides control over the visible <em>rows</em> in a table-based
viewer.  Hide/Show columns provides control over the visible
<em>columns</em> in a table-based viewer.  Selecting "Hide/Show" from the
Column menu in a table-based viewer brings up a dialog box containing a set
of checkbox items, one for every column (i.e. field) that can be viewed in
the Leap data object.  In Naia, for example, the Hide/Show dialog box looks
like this:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables7.gif">
<p>

In the above example, I've already clicked on some boxes to change the
default setting for the displayed columns.  After pressing OK on this
dialog box, Naia will present its data in the following way:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables8.gif" width=100%>
<p>

The set of displayed columns for a given tool is  
"sticky" between invocations of the tool.  Each time you bring up 
Leap, it displays the set of columns last visible from the previous
invocation.

<p>

One field is always hidden in all table-based viewers: the "LeapDataFile"
This field contains a list of values indicating the file or files 
associated with this individual entry in the table. The LeapDataFile
field is an internal field that Leap uses to keep track of where data
should be saved. This is unfortunately a somewhat complicated subject,
and for full details, you should consult the chapter on 
<A HREF="saving.html">Saving Leap Data</A>.   At any rate, I do  not
recommend that you edit the LeapDataFile field by hand, and under
most normal circumstances, you do not need to be concerned with this
field or its value.   However, its presence is a useful reminder of the fact
that each row in a table-based viewer represents a single Leap data
object, and that different Leap data objects can be saved into and
loaded from different locations.  (In fact, a single Leap data
object can be associated with multiple files simultaneously! See,
I told you saving was complicated :-)


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "button">The generic table button bar</a></h2>

As illustrated in the screen dump at the beginning of this chapter, each
table-based viewer contains a button bar beneath the tabular arrangement of
data entries.  This button bar contains a number of standard buttons
providing quick access to certain common operations on the table, and
include: Save,  Load, Clear Table, Add Rows, Delete Rows, Hide Rows,
and Close.  Certain tools add special purpose buttons to the button
bar. For example, Honu (the defect table-based viewer) adds a "Mail" button
for emailing defects to others during a review).  This section documents
the operation of those buttons included in all table-based viewers.

<p>

<p><b>Save</b><p>

 The Save button enables you to save out the contents of this
table. Recall that a table can contain Leap data objects loaded from across
several files, and that some of those may have been edited during this
session. In addition, new objects may have been added during this session
which do not have any file associated with them yet.  So, the Save button
is responsible for saving back to their originating files all of the
entries which were loaded, as well as saving out new entries
to a file for the first time.  To accomplish this, pressing the Save
button pops up a dialog box asking for the file location where new 
entries should be saved:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables9.gif">
<p>

Note that you are given a pull-down menu of files to choose from, taken
from the set of files providing Leap data objects to this table.  Thus, the
"Save" button requires you to save all new entries into one of the files
you previously loaded containing Leap data objects displayed in this table.
<p>
(Note: as you can see, this screen dump illustrates a common bug in the
current Swing implementation: the title associated with Windows menus
is not updated.)
<p>

If all of the entries in the table are new entries, then Save displays
a standard File Chooser dialog box instead:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables10.gif">
<p>


<p><b>Load</b><p>

The Load button pops up a standard File Chooser dialog box, as illustrated
below:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables11.gif">
<p>

After selecting a file and pressing "Open", the contents of that file will
be loaded into Leap.  Note that this operation is not specific to the
particular table-based viewer in which you pressed Load.  In other words,
the file you load may or may not contain Leap data objects belonging to the
particular table, but the data will be loaded just the same.  For
example, if you are in Naia, press Load, and load a file containing only defect
entries, then nothing will be displayed in Naia but Honu will now be
augmented with new data.

<p><b>Clear Table</b><p>

The Clear Table button removes all of the entries from
the current table-based viewer.  Pressing the Clear Table button
pops up the following dialog box:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables12.gif">
<p>

If you press "Yes", all of the entries in this table will be removed and no
longer loaded in Leap.  This operation is destructive and not particularly
forgiving: if there are new entries in this table or if you have edited old
entries, you will not be prompted to save them before the table is erased.
Of course, you can always reload the file or files from which any entries were
loaded, but any changes or new additions will be lost.


<p><b>Add Rows</b><p>

When a table-based viewer is initially displayed, it provides 10 blank rows in
addition to the rows containing Leap data objects.  During a session, it is 
possible to fill up these 10 blank rows with new data objects.  Pressing
the Add Rows button adds 10 additional  blank rows so that further new
data can be added.

<p><b>Delete Rows</b><p>

To delete a Leap data object in a table based viewer, you can select the 
row containing the data object and press the Delete Rows button.  To 
select a row, click in the index number on the left hand side of the 
row. The corresponding row will be highlighted.  To select a range
of rows, click in the first row and drag the mouse vertically to select
adjacent rows. For example, here is the Honu table-based defect viewer
with one row selected:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables13.gif" width=100%>
<p>

Once you have selected your rows, pressing the Delete Rows button will
bring up a dialog box asking you to confirm this deletion. For example,
having selected the row above, pressing Delete Rows will result in the
following dialog box:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables14.gif">
<p>

Pressing yes will confirm the deletion and the row will be deleted.
All subsequent rows will be updated with new index values. 
<p>
Note that there is no "undo" operation for deleted rows.

<p><b>Hide Rows</b><p>

The Hide Rows button provides you with a row-based, rather than column 
value-based, approach to filtering.  Hide Rows is similar to Delete
Rows in that you must first select a row by mouse clicking 
over the index number associated with the row to be hidden, and
dragging vertically to select additional adjacent rows if desired.
Once the row or rows is selected, pressing Hide Rows brings up 
a dialog box confirming that you wish to filter the specified 
Leap data object. For example, if I selected the object in at
index 24 to filter and pressed Hide Rows, the following dialog 
box would appear:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables15.gif">
<p>

After pressing Yes, the Leap data object in row 24 would be hidden from
view.  You can tell that the object is hidden because the index value
is now missing:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables16.gif" width=100%>
<p>

If the object had been deleted, index value 24 would have been reassigned
to the next data object. 
<p>
To redisplay the hidden rows, you must UnFilter the table using standard
Filtering mechanisms.  This involves shift-clicking on any column 
containing the Filter icon, which brings up a dialog box containing an
UnFilter button.  Pressing this button will unhide all hidden rows as
well as all other data hidden using filtering. 

<p>
For more details on Filtering, see the section earlier in this chapter.


<p><b>Close</b><p>

The close button closes the window containing the table-based viewer tool.
It does not have any destructive effect on the Leap data, however.  You 
can reselect the tool from the Leap Toolset window and all of the data
you entered will be still there. 

<p>
Close does not implicitly save the data. 


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "file">The generic table File menu</a></h2>

All table-based viewers provide a File menu, as illustrated below:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables18.gif">
<p>

The File menu facilities include:

<p><b>New/Clear</b><p>

"New/Clear" is bound to the same operation as the "Clear Table" button.
See the above documentation on the Clear Table button for details.

<p><b>Load</b><p>

"Load" is bound to the same operation as the "Load" button.
See the above documentation on the Load button for details.

<p><b>Load URL</b><p>

The "Load URL" menu item brings up a modal dialog box allowing you to type in an
URL:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables19.gif">
<p>

If the URL points to a Leap data file, then this file will be loaded. 
Unlike Leap data files on a local file system that you load using the 
"Load" button or File menu item, Leap data loaded via an URL cannot 
be saved back to its originating location.

<p><b>Save All</b><p>

The "Save All" menu item allows you to save out all the currently loaded
Leap data files and any new entries.  Invoking Save All brings up the 
Save Tables modal window:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables20.gif">
<p>

This window shows you via the checkbox which tables have unsaved and/or new
entries in them, and allows you to specify into which file you would like
to save the new entries. For convenience, a pull-down list provides you
with access to all of the files that have contained entries for that
particular table type. The Browse button brings up the standard File
Chooser window.
In the above screen, only the Defects table
contained new or modified entries, and so that is the only table that
appears with a check in its checkbox. For more details on the somewhat
complicated topic of Saving, see the Save chapter.

<p><b>Export</b><p>

The "Export" menu item allows you to create one or more new Leap files containing 
data from one or more Leap tables. Selecting the Export menu item
results in the following dialog window:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables21.gif">
<p>

Notice that in this case, every table containing any data at all is checked 
by default.  You should uncheck any tables you do not wish to save to the 
new file location, then type in the new file or files where you wish the
table data to be exported. Note that Exporting does not change the current state
of your Leap internal files. In other words, if, after exporting, you 
modify an entry in a table and then press save, it will be saved out to 
the original location it was read from, not to the location where the 
table was exported.   Exporting produces a copy of your Leap data files
without changing the internal file membership of individual entries. 

<p><b>Save as HTML</b><p>

In many situations, the contents of a Leap table is well suited as  
the basis for a "report". For example, you might want to print out
the contents of Honu or make the current contents of that table 
accessable via the Web to another person. 
<p>
Since Leap data files are output in a constrained form of HTML, you
could in some sense do this simply by providing an URL to your Leap
data file or including it in a larger HTML document. However, most
Leap data files contain fields devoted to particular contexts
that may not be relevant to the purpose at hand (for 
example, the "Doc ID" field if the entire table concerns only one document).

<p>

The "Save as HTML" menu item enables you to easily create an HTML formatted
version of the current table, where only <em>visible</em> columns and rows are
output to the HTML file.  This allows you to customize the set of columns
(i.e. data fields) present in your report.

<p>

It is important to keep in mind that the "Save as HTML" menu item does not
produce a file that can be read back in to Leap, unlike the normal Leap
data files (which, only coincidentally, are also formatted as HTML.)

<p><b>Duplicate selected</b><p>

"Duplicate selected" is a poorly named menu item for a very useful
operation.  When using Leap, you will sometimes find yourself in a
situation where you want to merge the contents of one Leap data file into
another.  In my workaday world, this frequently happens when I use the LOCC
system to generate a Leap data file containing size information for a work
product. LOCC typically generates a single file containing size information
for each work product.  However, I have another Leap data file called
techreports.leap in which I am accumulating data about all of my tech
report projects, including their size.  What I frequently want to do is
load the data file generated by LOCC into Leap, and have it saved out into
my techreports.leap file.  For example, the next screen illustrates my use
of LOCC to generate the current size of the file I am now editing,
tables.html, and save the Leap data file into the file tables.siz:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables22.gif">
<p>

After loading this file into my Leap process, the Iole table viewer
(after some hiding and showing of columns) shows the following:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables23.gif" width=100%>
<p>

As the above screen illustrates, all of my old sizes have been saved in 
techreports.leap, but the last size entry is from tables.siz. If I
quite Leap now, then the next time I start up, I will have to load
both techreports.leap and tables.siz to recover the full contents of
this table.  It would be more convenient if I could easily tell Leap
to save that entry into techreports.leap.  This is the goal of 
the "Duplicate Selected" menu item.  First, select the row you 
wish to add a new LeapDataFile entry to:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables24.gif" width=100%>
<p>

Next, invoke the Duplicate Selected menu item, which results in the
following dialog box:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables25.gif">
<p>

Next, select the file in which you want this entry to be saved out
to in addition to its original file. In my case, I want this entry
to be included in the techreports.leap file:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables26.gif">
<p>

Then press "Copy".  This has two results. First, the specified file
is added to the LeapDataFile entry for each of the selected entries.
Second, all of the entries in the table containing LeapDataFile
entries are saved out. The screen below illustrates the new 
LeapDataFile entry for the selected size data:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables27.gif" width=100%>
<p>

Now I can quit Leap, and the next time I bring it up, I can load 
techreports.leap and all of the associated data will be included.

<p><b>Close</b><p>

The close menu item invokes the same operation as the Close button.
See the above documentation on the Close button for details.



<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "analyses">The generic table Analyses menu</a></h2>


With the single exception of Iole, the size data viewer, every other
table-based viewer contains an "Analyses" menu item. This menu item allows
you to run one or more potentially useful analyses on the data current
displayed in that table.  For example, the following screen illustrates
the analyses currently available from Honu on defect data:

<p>
<img src="screens/tables17.gif" width=100%>
<p>

Table-based analyses focus on the data in that single table and other
Leap definitions, and as with
all analyses, reflects the current filtering in effect. If you filter out
or hide data, that data will not show up in the analysis.


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "resizing">Resizing rows and columns</a></h2>

You can resize the space provided to individual rows or columns by
positioning the mouse over the column or row divider. The mouse will
change to an icon indicating that resizing will occur if you press
the mouse and drag.
