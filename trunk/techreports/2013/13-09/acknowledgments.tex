This research project could not have been completed without the help of a number of people. My deeply thanks go to Prof. Philip Johnson, who has been my most respectful advisor and mentor for my four fruitful years in the Collaborative Software Development Lab. 
  
I'd also like to thank past and present members of CSDL in chronological order: Robert Brewer, George Lee, Michelle Kat\-chuck, Carleton Moore and Jordan Takayama. Special thanks go to George Lee, who developed the initial version of Makahiki. The Makahiki research project would not have happened without your long hours and hard work.

I would like to thank my committee members Prof. David Chin, Prof. Scott Robertson, Prof. Lipyeow Lim, and Prof. Daniel Port for taking the time to read and evaluate this dissertation.

This research is supported in part by grant IIS-1017126 from the National Science Foundation and the funding from the Center for Renewable Energy and Island Sustainability (REIS).
