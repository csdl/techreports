It seems the major take away of reading the debates of gamification is that, before the novelty of simple gamification hadn’t worn off, and it seemed like an amazing idea that everything could be made more fun and motivational with achievements and points. Now we know it’s crucial that we make good games, rather than take the easiest bits to reproduce (points) and apply them to everything.

There was a definite feeling of, “We’re only at the start of something here, a turning point, so we better steer it well” throughout it all…

In a field rife with anecdotes but little hard data, Wharton's Werbach and New York Law School's Hunter intend to develop in-depth case studies to examine the types of business problems organizations want gamification to solve, the techniques used and the results. According to Werbach, there currently are few bridges between game design as a craft and psychological research. "That's why research is valuable -- to get beyond whether gamification is good or bad, and does it work or not."
