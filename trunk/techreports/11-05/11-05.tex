\begin{abstract}
As "Gamification" quickly becomes the hot debating topic across a wide range of industries and academia, it deserves more thorough studies and researches both qualitatively and quantitively. This document intends to survey this recent phenonemon of gamification being argued as a world changing layer or a useless buzzword. It provides a comparative review of different school of thoughts on the effectiveness of applying game mechanics to non-game context. Both industry implementations and academia researches are reviewed and analyzed. With the goal of providing a empirical research on effectively gamifying web applications, the current methodology of game related analytics is also surveyed.
