\begin{abstract}
As ``Gamification'' quickly becomes a hot topic across a wide range of industries and academia, it deserves more thorough study through qualitative and quantitative research. This document provides a survey of this recent phenomenon of ``gamification'': a concept that has been applauded as a ``game changing layer'' and derided as a ``useless buzzword''. It provides a comparative review of different schools of thoughts on the effectiveness of applying game mechanics to non-game contexts. Both industry implementations and academic research is reviewed and analyzed. With the goal of providing an empirical research basis on effectively gamifying web applications, this document also surveys the current methodology of game related analytics.
