<h3>Introduction</h3>

Current software engineering activities in CSDL can be viewed as consisting
of two basic components: product engineering and process
engineering. Product engineering refers to the various work products
created during development.  Process engineering refers to the various
measurements and analyses performed on the development process.  A major
continuing focus of CSDL for the past five years has been to better
understand and improve our process and product engineering within our
academic research development environment.  
<p>

This document presents an overview of our findings thus far. It emphasizes
the software engineering techniques that we have successfully adopted
within CSDL and used consistently, in most cases for several years. The
final section of this document briefly presents our current and planned
future experimental activities in software engineering.


<p>

<h3>Product Engineering</h3>

In our development, we observe the following relative degrees of 
volatility in our work products:

<pre>
code &gt; tests &gt; class interfaces &gt;&gt; class hierarchy &gt;&gt; architecture
</pre>

In other words, code changes very rapidly and unpredictably.  Public class
interfaces are less volatile than the code, but still change a great deal.
The overall collection of classes and their relationships changes more
slowly, and the architecture---the fundamental principles of coordination
and process---changes more slowly still.  This observation does not imply
that architecture is fixed: we redesigned the architecture of Egret (our
framework for collaborative systems) three distinct times, for example.  This
observation also does not imply that architecture is dictated top-down: in
Egret's case, many architectural features emerged in a bottom up style from
our experiences of building a suite of distinct collaborative applications
using Egret as infrastructure.

<p>

These different levels of volatility led us to conclude, from an
engineering perspective, that while it was reasonable to create stand-alone
documentation for slowly changing work products, such as architecture, it
was completely infeasible to create independent documentation for things
like code, tests, and class interfaces. While documentation of these
volatile components was absolutely essential to enable review, improvement,
and reuse of these work products, the only feasible way to maintain
accurate documentation in this highly exploratory environment was to
generate it by parsing the primary work product (typically Lisp source code).
We developed the initial version of a tool called DSB around 1992 for this
purpose.  DSB is a kind of "JavaDoc on steroids", in that it not only
generates HTML (or better yet, LaTeX) by extracting class interfaces and
comment strings, it also provides a simple but useful form of quality
assurance. DSB checks, for example, to see that all public functions have a
documentation string, and that all documentation strings for a public
function mention each parameter explicitly.  Violations of these and other
errors or omissions and their location are provided as an appendix to the
generated design document.

<p>

DSB is integrated with another system called Defsys, also initially developed
around 1992.  Defsys uses RCS and other tools to support a simple
configuration management scheme which provides a serial stream of
"releases", along with a separate "development" version of software
components. We use a three level release versioning scheme in CSDL:
<em>X.Y.Z</em>, where <em>X</em> indicates a major redesign of the
component, <em>Y</em> indicates an enhancement, and <em>Z</em> 
indicates a bug fix. 

<p>

From 1991 to 1995, we developed Egret and a suite of collaborative
applications based upon it: AEN (a collaborative hypertext authoring
tool), CSRS (a collaborative code review tool), CLARE (a collaborative
learning environment), and ShEmacs (a shared Emacs editor). We used 
DSB and Defsys to coordinate this development.  Egret, for example,
went through 3 major releases (each of which involved an architectural 
redesign), over two dozen minor releases, and perhaps 60-100 distinct
bug fix releases. 

<p>

For details on DSB, Defsys, and our methods for product engineering in the
Egret system and its applications, see our internal developer page at:
<blockquote>

         http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/Primer/lisp.html</a>
</blockquote>





We did not "finish" Egret, then start work on its applications. 
Instead, Egret and its applications were developed concurrently
in a deeply co-evolutionary manner.  In such a situation, where
architectures, interfaces, designs, and code are in a state of
flux for literally years, configuration management (using defsys) and 
current documentation (using DSB) were not sufficient by themselves.
The third essential component of our product engineering was
automated regression testing.  
<p>
We approached testing from a purely pragmatic point of view. 
We realized that unless testing was virtually free, we wouldn't do
it. We also realized that any sort of comprehensive testing would
take too much work and anyway, we didn't really understand what it 
would mean to do "comprehensive" testing, and weren't interested
in trying to figure that out.  The goal of testing in CSDL was to
try to minimize and quickly catch <em>regression</em>: the situation
where something that used to work has stopped working, either because
your code or someone's code that you're using has changed in an
unforeseen manner.  CSDL testing also had to be <em>automatic</em>:
it must be possible to invoke a single function to run all the test
cases defined for a given system and report the results.  These
goals led to the following style of test case development:
<ul>
<li> No user-level interaction.  All tests consist of calls to 
the public interface of classes.
<li> Minimal attempt at breadth.  A satisfactory test suite for a component
called every public function at least once. More than one function could
be called in a given test case, of course.
<li> Incremental test suite development. The set of tests included with 
the initial release of a component could be relatively small. 
However, after finding and fixing a bug, we would often add a new test case to 
exercise the function that was broken. 
</ul>

Despite this extremely unsophisticated approach, the Egret regression
test suite alone grew to over 100 test cases, which were always invoked
before any new release of the system. Implemented this way, CSDL
regression testing became very popular with all the developers, since
each test case would be defined only once but could be used on every 
subsequent release of the system as a simple quality assurance check.
Needless to say, innumerable errors were caught during regression test,
and the "unit-level" nature of the test meant that the failing test
typically pointed the developer quite accurately toward the code 
(or at least the developer) responsible. 
<p>

We also found an unanticipated use for regression testing. The Egret
regression test cases are provided with the public release and used in the
installation process to check whether the system is running correctly.

<p>
For an example of our regression testing system, see the following design
document (in postscript) for ECSTest, the regression test suite we built for Egret:
<blockquote>

         http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/designs/ecstest-1.2.4.ps</a>
</blockquote>


In the summer preceeding the public release of Egret, I began work on a
tutorial guide which was intended to (a) explain the basic mechanisms in
Egret, (b) how to combine them together to produce collaborative systems,
and (c) illustrate via simple examples some of our general insights on how
to develop collaborative systems. Several students took an independent
study course with me, worked through all the examples, and generally
debugged the presentation. The 120 page Egret Primer became an essential
supplement to the 180 page Egret design documentation, because Egret and
its application suite had now grown to over 60,000 lines of code, the
client side alone involving six major subsystems, 35 classes, and over 500
public functions:

</blockquote>


In 1995, we made the first public release of Egret and a set of
applications developed using it: 

<blockquote>

<a href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/egret/release-notes.html">
         http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/egret/release-notes.html</a>
</blockquote>



Since 1995, Egret has been downloaded from our site over 300 times, and
continues to be downloaded on an average of about once every week.  Actual
<em>usage</em> at remote sites has been non-zero (reports on use of Egret
and/or Egret applications have appeared in publications by several
independent research groups), but it is clear that very little if any
long-term "adoption" of Egret technology within external organizations has
occurred.

<p>

Despite low adoption, I am extremely proud of the Egret project, not only
for its research contributions (as reported in six journal articles, seven
conference publications, and ten refereed workshop articles) but for its
software engineering aspects alone.  It took us three major redesigns over
four years, but Version 4 of Egret is (in my humble and admittedly biased
opinion) an elegant collaborative architecture.  The class structure verges
on the poetic in its simplicity, economy, and expressiveness. Much of the
code cuts like butter. But don't take my word for it: take a look at the
design and code yourself. In the end, we built Egret to be read as
literature as much as to be executed as a system.



<h3>Process Engineering</h3>

At the beginning of 1996, a few months following Egret's public release, a
couple of important shifts in my view on CSDL software engineering
occurred. First, I felt that CSDL had acquired a basic grounding in the
principles of software product engineering, and that although further
product engineering improvements were needed, we also needed to begin
emphasizing process issues as well.  At the same time, I started teaching a
course based upon Watts Humphrey's "A Discipline of Software Engineering".
This book articulates a "personal software process", which struck me as
much more relevant and adaptable to the needs of CSDL than prior process
work such as the Capability Maturity Model, which seemed to require large
institutional infrastructure not accessable to my group.

<p>
Second, I felt that the XEmacs/Unix platform constraints for Egret 
had too severely constrained our user/evaluation community, and that
Java ("twice as good as C++, half as good as Lisp") was a cross
platform development language with acceptably low levels of bogosity.
After some initial playing around, we decided to move to Java for 
new development and suspend further work on the Egret code base.

<p>
During 1996 and continuing to the present, we have been working on a
Java-based toolkit to support PSP-style development and CSRS-style software
review in an integrated format. Moving to Java meant that we needed to
rebuild our product engineering environment (Defsys, DSB, regression
testing, etc). We no longer needed DSB, since the JavaDoc package provided a
sufficient subset of its functionality.  We did modify DefSys to work on Java
files and observe the Java package-subdirectory relationship.  Finally, we
defined some conventions for how to build regression test suites for each
package.

         http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/Primer/Java/regression-test-standard.html</a>
</blockquote>


In addition to the product engineering support, which we carried over
from the Egret project, we added a more formalized development process
which combined aspects of our de facto process that resulted from 
Egret with additional procedures to support process improvement from
our PSP experiences. We call this process CSDL/Baseline, as it is 
intended to be the "jumping off point" from which each CSDL 
developer builds their own, individualized development process

</blockquote>

For this project, I also extended our product engineering 
efforts by developing a software requirements 
specification document. This document was intended to articulate the vision
for the research project through a set of scenarios.  The SRS 
also included extremely simple mockups of the user interface and 
a preliminary task breakdown:

<blockquote> 
PSP/Baseline: Software Requirements Specification:<br>

         http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/96-19/96-19.html</a>
</blockquote>


We have now worked for approximately six months using this product and
process engineering, and the preliminary results are encouraging.  
CSDL has gone on hiatus this summer, partially due to my sabbatical 
visit to DSTC, and partially due to my inordinate success at placing
CSDL students in industry internships for the summer. 
The released packages in the system so far can be
viewed at:

<h3>Summary</h3>

Despite the gradually increasing level of formality in both process and
product software engineering within CSDL, and an increasing emphasis on
requirements, design, and testing in addition to coding, we do not use, nor
are we moving toward a "waterfall" model of software development. We see
requirements, design, coding, and testing as a linear, sequential process
only during the initial implementation of a software component; for the
majority of a component's lifetime, these phases are concurrent, entwined
activities.  Our development process can be better viewed as a structured
walk through the space of all possible component designs and component
interactions. CSDL software engineering is designed to accelerate the
velocity of this walk and to provide insight into its direction.

<p>

The legacy of the multi-year Egret project is that current CSDL members
are, for example, actively using and maintaining code (such as DefSys) that
was designed five years ago by members who have graduated from the group.
We know through our own personal experience and through our daily
activities that it is worthwhile to invest time and energy into product and
process engineering activities, because we will have to live with the
outcomes of these activities for months or years to come.

<h3>Future Directions: Toward Organizational Engineering</h3>

CSDL is still a young organization and its software engineering
culture is still quite volatile.  Furthermore, significant gaps in its
product and process engineering still exist, which I hope we will address
over the next several years. 
<p>

While everyone in CSDL is committed to improving our process and product
engineering, I intend over the next year to add a third focal point to
CSDL: <em>organizational</em> engineering.  Becoming a world class software
engineer within a world class software engineering group requires more than
simply state-of-the-art tools and methods. In fact, it is generally
accepted that these issues are of secondary importance next to the social,
cultural, managerial, and physical environments surrounding the activity of
software development.  Over the next year, in concert with the move of CSDL
to its new space in the POST building, I will begin activities intended to
explore organizational engineering and its relationship with product and
process engineering.  My ultimate goal is to provide CSDL members with an
example of and experience with a world-class product, process, and
organization. CSDL members can use this experience as a basis for
transforming and improving their post-CSDL professional development
environments.  A separate document on organizational engineering in CSDL is
forthcoming.
