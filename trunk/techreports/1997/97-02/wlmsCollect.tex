\caption{{\bf Data Collection for each WLMS inspection.}
This figure shows the data collected from one team's WLMS inspection (using the
DC inspection method). The first three rows identify the review team members, th
e inspection methods they used, the number of faults they found, and shows their
 individual fault summaries. The fourth row contains the team fault summary. The
 fault summaries show a 1 (0) where the team or individual found (did not find)
a fault.
Meeting gain and loss rates can be calculated by comparing the individual and
team fault summaries. For instance, fault 21 is an example of {\it meeting
loss}. It was found by reviewer 18 during the fault detection activity,
but the team did not report it at the collection meeting.
Fault 32 is an example of {\it meeting gain}; it was first discovered
at the collection meeting.}
