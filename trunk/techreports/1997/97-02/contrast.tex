\caption{{\bf Fault Detection Rates by Independent Variable.}
The dashes in the far left column show each team's fault
detection rate for the WLMS and CRUISE. The horizontal line
is the average fault detection rate. The plot demonstrates the
ability of each variable to explain variation in the
fault detection rates. For the Specification variable, the vertical
location of WLMS (CRUISE) is determined by averaging the fault
detection rates for all teams inspecting WLMS (CRUISE). The
vertical bracket, ], to the right of each variable shows one
standard error of the difference between two settings of the
variable. }
