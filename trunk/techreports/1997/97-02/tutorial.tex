What Makes Inspections Work? Discovering the Drivers of Inspection
Costs and Benefits. 

For two decades, software inspections have proven effective for detecting
defects in software. We have reviewed the various proposals 
for conducting software inspections, and empirically evaluated claims 
about the cost-effectiveness of different methods. 

We detect a disturbing pattern in the evaluation of inspection methods. 
Although there is near universal agreement on the effectiveness of software 
inspection, their economics are uncertain. Our research leads us to conclude that
the benefits of inspections are often overstated and the costs (especially
for large software developments) are understated. Furthermore, 
there is little understanding of the mechanisms that drive these costs
and benefits.

Extensive work is needed to determine exactly how, why, and when software 
inspections work, and whether some defect detection techniques might
be more cost-effective than others. In this talk we describe a long-term
study in which we compare the cost-effectiveness of several different 
software inspection methods and determined which factors really drive these
costs and benefits.
