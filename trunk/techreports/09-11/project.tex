\subsection*{Project Vision, Goals, Objectives, and Outcomes}


{\em Describe the CT-centric vision, goals, objectives, and anticipated outcomes of the proposed project. Clearly indicate how they will contribute to realization of the three CPATH program goals: (1) contribute to the development of a globally competitive U.S. workforce with CT competencies essential to U.S. leadership in the global innovation enterprise; (2) increase the number of students developing CT competencies by infusing CT learning opportunities into undergraduate education in the core computing - computer and information science and engineering - disciplines, and in other fields of study; and, (3) demonstrate transformative CT-focused undergraduate education models that are replicable across a variety of institutions.

``Computational thinking involves solving problems, designing systems, and
understanding human behavior, by drawing on the concepts fundamental to
computer science \cite{Wing06}''.  In her presentation ``Computational
Thinking and Thinking About Computation'', Wing refines these fundamental
computer science concepts as in terms of the ``Two As'': abstraction and
automation.  Activities in the first A include: choosing the right
abstractions, operating at multiple levels of abstraction, and defining
relationships between abstractions.  Activities in the second A involve
mechanizing the first A via precise notations and models.  Automation
amplifies the power of abstraction.  Computational thinking, from this
perspective, is about the correct choice of abstraction combined with the
correct choice of automation.

The vision of this proposal is to develop an approach to computational
thinking that combines abstraction and automation to transform {\em
empirical thinking} in software development.

The term ``empirical'' is variously defined as ``derived from experiment
and observation rather than theory''; ``evidence or consequences observable
by the senses''; and ``capable of being verified or disproved by
observation or experiment.''

Empirical thinking is already commonplace in software development.  For
example, beginning programmers use empirical thinking when the observe the
output of the compiler to learn how to write syntactically correct
programs.  Beginners also tend to make extensive use of experimentation:
they will run their program with example data, compare the actual behavior
to what they expect to be the behavior, then make modifications as
necessary.

These forms of empirical thinking, while satisfactory for beginning
programmers, do not scale because they do not contain the two A's.
Clearly, direct observation of the program behavior or its source code
contains neither abstraction nor automation.

One would think that as students progress into more advanced computer
curriculum, two things should occur: the complexity, size, and personnel
involved in software development projects will scale upwards, and the
degree of abstraction and automation support for empirical thinking will
increase commensurately. While advanced software development courses
certainly require students to develop significantly more sophisticated
systems than their introductory counterparts, their empirical thinking to a
great extent remains non-abstract and non-automated. 

The goal of this research is to explore, enhance, and evaluate tools and
technologies for abstraction and automation of empirical thinking in
advanced software development courses.  As one example, we have developed a
system and associated curriculum called the ``Software Intensive Care
Unit'' which automatically collects raw software development process and
product data and abstracts it into a set of ten ``vital signs''.that
provide an empirical way for students to gauge the ``health'' of their
ongoing projects.  The Software ICU enables a form of empirically-based,
computational thinking by students about the state of their projects and
how they might work more efficiently and effectively to produce a higher
quality system.

To achieve this goal, we will pursue several concrete objectives. Firstr, evaluate
in courses at University of Hawaii.  Disseminate to other courses.  Create a community around the empirical thinking approach and the technology.  Produce tailored versions for other universities.  Produce enhancements for both professioanl settings and for more introductory programs. 


Our anticipated outcomes will directly support the goals of the CPATH program as follows:
We anticipate creating software development professionals with experience using abstract, automated, empirical forms of computational thinking.   These skills will increase their productivity and competitiveness. As our target is advanced software development courses, this program will inject this new form of empirical computational thinking into

Where appropriate, provide institutional data to document the current environment by uploading data into the Supplementary Docs section in FastLane.}

\subsection*{Implementation Plan}

{\em Describe in detail the CT-centric activities to be undertaken to realize the project vision, goals, objectives and anticipated outcomes. 

Define, or describe how the proposing team will attempt to define, the core computing concepts, methods, technologies and tools to be integrated into promising new undergraduate education models.  Describe your plans to identify and implement effective strategies to develop and assess CT competencies in the relevant learning communities.  Identify the stakeholder cohort, e.g. K-20 administrators, faculty, teachers, students, etc., that will participate in and/or benefit from the activities. If relevant, describe how change will be effected and sustained in the participating organizations.  

Describe project milestones in the context of a project timeline and identify responsible parties and expected outcomes for each milestone.  Summarize this information in a figure that you upload into the Supplementary Docs section in FastLane. 

Describe how project outputs and outcomes will be disseminated to the relevant stakeholder groups and to the national community and if relevant, how project resources will be made available to others to adopt or adapt. Identify proactive measures to find and support adopters of promising models and/or practices. Describe plans for outreach to other groups or interested institutions that will take place during the project.
