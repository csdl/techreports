\subsection*{Salaries}

The project budget provides salary support for the principal investigator
(one summer months) and two graduate research
assistants (11 months) for each of the three years.  The principal
investigator will perform or supervise all major system design enhancements
and empirical studies, and manage and train the graduate student
assistant.

\subsection*{Travel}

The project budget provides funds for two trips per year from Hawaii to the
mainland.  These funds will be used by the principal investigator to attend
one relevant conference (e.g., ICSE, FSE, ISERN, or CSEET) each year, as well 
as attend one CPATH meeting per year. 

\subsection*{Materials and Supplies}

The principal investigator directs the Collaborative Software Development
Laboratory, which is currently equipped with one enterprise server and several
workstations, along with a printer and networking peripherals.  The project
budget provides funds of \$4,000 per year for each year of the grant to
provide materials and supplies related to thep lab.

\subsection*{Cost breakdown}
\label{cost-breakdown}

All calculations are rounded to the nearest dollar.

\paragraph{Summer Salary.}  
The budget provides for one month of summer salary (\$12,918) for the principal investigator for
each of the three years.  A 2\% increase is projected for each of the following two years. 

\paragraph*{Research Assistants.}  
The budget provides for two graduate research assistantships
for each of the three years.  The salary for each research assistant is
based upon an 11 month RA-Step 7 salary (\$19,680) for each year, with a 
2\% increase each year. 

\paragraph*{Fringe benefits.} 
Fringe benefits for salaries are calculated at 3.5\% for the principal
investigator and 25\% for the graduate assistants.

\paragraph*{Overhead.}  
University of Hawaii overhead cost is calculated as 38.4\% of Modified Total
Direct Costs (MTDC), i.e. salaries, travel, and supplies (equipment is
excluded).
