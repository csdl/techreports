\subsubsection{Education and workforce development}

{\em This project will not only include development of science and
  technology, but also curriculum materials. We will teach a variety of
  courses alongside the development of the microgrid which will enable our
  students to develop skills necessary to deploy these technologies. These
  curriculum materials will be made publically available.

  Contributions of this part of the research will include the development of curriculum
  materials and the creation of engineers and scientists skilled in this
  area.}
