\subsection{Results from prior NSF research}

{\em From the NSF GPG:

If any PI or co-PI identified on the project has received NSF funding in the past five years, information on the award(s) is required. Each PI and co-PI who has received more than one award (excluding amendments) must report on the award most closely related to the proposal. The following information must be provided:
\begin{itemize}
\item	the NSF award number, amount and period of support;

\item	the title of the project;

\item	summary of the results of the completed work, including accomplishments related to the Broader Impact activities supported by the award and, for a research project, any contribution to the development of human resources in science and engineering;

\item	publications resulting from the NSF award;

\item	evidence of research products and their availability, including, but not limited to: data, publications, samples, physical collections, software, and models, as described in any Data Management Plan; and

\item	if the proposal is for renewed support, a description of the relation of the completed work to the proposed work.

\end{itemize}
Reviewers will be asked to comment on the quality of the prior work described in this section of the proposal. Please note that the proposal may contain up to five pages to describe the results. Results may be summarized in fewer than five pages, which would give the balance of the 15 pages for the Project Description.
