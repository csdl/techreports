If I find evidence that my thesis claims are true, then I believe the
formal inspection process should address some sort of quantitative approach
for initiating inspections.

In addition, I believe that the system's quantification of quality is
valuable in of itself. Development teams can use the system's attributes of
quality to guide the management of quality.
