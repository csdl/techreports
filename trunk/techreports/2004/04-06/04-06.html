<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This report presents several screen shots of Hackystat Analyses that
were conducted on the Mission Data System's Release 9 (February 16 -
May 15, 2004). The goal of this report is to identify a single to a few
screen shots that could be useful in the future Monthly Management
Report
for the Mars Science
Laboratory. <br>
<br>
Section 1.0 provides the screen shots of various Hackystat Analyses.
Section 2.0 provides a collection of comments reported back about the
analyses.<br>
</p>
<h2>1.0 Hackystat Analyses </h2>
<p>Each of the following subsection provides a screen shot of data
relevant to the MDS Release 9.&nbsp; In this report we provide little
to none explanations of the results, rather we simply provide initial
glimpses into some of the analyses that we are now able to do
execute.&nbsp; Please see&nbsp; &lt;<a
 href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/04-02/04-02.html">http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/04-02/04-02.html</a>&gt;
for detailed descriptions of past results. <br>
<br>
NOTE: these images are screen shots and therefore lose all of the "tool
tip" functionality that Hackystat provides. <br>

<h3>1.1 Active Developers</h3>
This analysis provides a bar chart of the number of developers that
contributed to a state change for a specified interval.&nbsp; In the
future this analysis will be useful to track how attributes of MDS
changes when the number of active developers increase over time.<br>

<h3>1.4 Promotion vs Demotion<br>

promotions and demotions that occur in a given interval.<br>

<h3>1.5 Throughput</h3>
This analysis provides line charts of the number of State Changes that
occur for specified State Changes in a given interval.&nbsp; For
example, we can calculate the number of State Changes between the Dev
and Dev Complete Harvest States. <br>

<h3>1.6 Work vs Rework<br>
</h3>
This analysis provides stacked bar charts of the level of work vs the
level of rework.&nbsp; Work is defined as scheduled work and is
operationalized with the measurement of the number of Change Packages
that move from Dev to Dev Complete for the first time in the packages
workflow.&nbsp; Rework is defined as the unscheduled work and is
operationalized by measuring the number of Internal Modifications,
number of Internal Anomaly&nbsp; Reports, and the number of Change
Packages that transition from Dev to Dev Complete (for CPs we only
count transitions after the first transition in the package's workflow).<br>
<br>
1.6.1 Work vs Rework - All Data<br>

<h2>2.0 Comments </h2>
<h3>2.1 Dr. Philip Johnson (CSDL, UH)<br>
</h3>
<div>
<ul>
  <li>&nbsp;The tooltips over the bar graphs are not informative.&nbsp;
Particularly when you have 20 or so lines on a chart, the colors don't
really distinguish the identities. It would be very helpful to have the
tooltips identify the 'owner' of the line as well as the current value
of the data point.</li>
  <li>1.2.2&nbsp; Build Results - Release 9 - Week Data</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Why were there so many compile failures in February?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>1.3.2&nbsp; Number of packages built - Release 9 - Week data</li>
  <ul>
    <li>OK, there's the answer to my last question.&nbsp; The reason
there wer so many compile failures in February is because that week had
many more packages included in a single build.</li>
    <li>It looks like we've got the beginnings of a causal chain: the
number of packages in a build might be a predictive measure of the
number of compile failures.&nbsp; The next step would be to see if
there are different impacts on development when you have a high number
of builds due to many compile failures (as in the week starting 08-Feb)
vs. around the same number of builds but with significantly less
compile failures (as in the weeks starting 18-April and 25-April)</li>
  </ul>
  <li>1.6.2 Work vs. Rework release 9</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Another chart showing that 08-Feb was a bummer week.&nbsp; The
"work" values might serve as a good baseline; they seem relatively
constant.</li>
    <li>All of this indicates to me that I'd really like to see these
values related to (a) the overall size of the system, (b) the number of
unit tests of the system (which is another proxy for 'functionality')
and (c) the amount of churn.</li>
    <li>I think I also want to see some of these values related to the
"magic" transition that indicates the package is finished (i.e. cm
build -&gt; integration test?)</li>
    <li>Basically, what we want is to see how values of "process"
(which are things like the throughput values, build results, the
box-and-whisker charts, etc.) are related to "product" (which is,
roughly speaking, the increase in functionality of the system, which
can be proxied by the value of the "magic" transition, the size, the
number of unit tests in the system, etc.)</li>
    <li>It does look like we're getting some "signal" out of the data,
which is good.&nbsp; The 08-Feb week is clearly an anomaly; it shows up
as a special week on at least three analyses.&nbsp; It might be worth
doing a little investigation to ask them what was going on that
week.&nbsp; At the same time, you can look for false negatives---were
there bad (or good) weeks that don't show up as such in this data?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>1.8.3 Comparative</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This is a cool new analysis! I'd like to also know the total
number of calendar days for each release, and then do some statistics
to see if there are relationships between calendar days and any of
these other indicators.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>1.9.* Developer data</li>
  <ul>
    <li>I can't see anything useful in here!</li>
  </ul>
  <li>1.11.2 Package age, release 9</li>
  <ul>
    <li>This one looks extremely interesting to me.&nbsp; I would like
to know how many packages are used to build each distribution in a
given week (as a tool tip).&nbsp; What I'm seeing here is that the
package age distribution is (and should) fall in
variability/mean/median as you get closer to a release date.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>So, a couple of questions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>&nbsp;How hard would it be to get some basic "product" measures
(size, churn, number unit tests, "magic" transition) into the analysis
mix?</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Can we start doing some analyses that combine one or more
key "product" measures with one or more key "process" measures?&nbsp;
What are the candidates for "key" process measures from the JPL
perspective, after looking at this data?</li>
    <li>Which product and process measures are available from other
projects? How can we "normalize", so that we can start to do things
like compare the MDS product/process trajectory with that of other
projects?</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
