   {
   Formal technical review (FTR) is an essential
   component of all software quality assessment, assurance, and
   improvement techniques.  However, current FTR practice leads to
   significant expense, clerical overhead, group process obstacles, and
   research methodology problems.
  
   CSRS is an instrumented, computer-supported cooperative work
   environment for formal technical review.  CSRS addresses problems in
   the practice of FTR by providing computer support for both the
   process and products of FTR.  CSRS also addresses problems in
   research on FTR through instrumentation supporting fine-grained, high
   quality data collection and analysis.  This paper describes CSRS, a
   computer-mediated review method called FTArm, and selected findings
   from their use to explore issues in formal technical review.  }
