\title{Hyperbase Server Performance comparisons} \author{Cam Moore}

\maketitle

I tested the three versions of the hyperbase server.  I connected to each
of the servers separately and called their functions.  I recorded the time
it took to execute each function 200 times.  For each function I repeated
this procedure five times and averaged the times.  The following table
contains the results of my timing:

             \begin{tabular} {|l|c|c|c|} \hline
             \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{{\bf Timing Results}} \\  \hline

\end{tabular}

             \caption{Average Times. }
             \end{figure}
             \normalsize
The times are very close.  It appears that there is no real difference in
performance between the three servers.  I beleive the differences in the
times are due to different loads on the machine while the test was being run.
