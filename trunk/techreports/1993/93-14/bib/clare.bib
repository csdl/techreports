The evolution of HCI technology has been characterized by the
task-artifact cycle, raising the question how do artifacts change tasks?
In answer we have started to analyze personal redesigns of Smalltalk/V
tools, to understand how and why the programming environment and the tasks
it supports evolve. We interviewed designers working with Smalltalk/V, and
asked them to describe their personal redesigns of the system tools
(browsers, inspectors etc.), motivations for redesign, and typical
scenarios of use before and after redesign. We found that designers do
consider usability issues, but sometimes not all the usability strengths
and weaknesses of existing interface techniques and of their redesigns. We
show how psychological claims analysis can support and guide such redesign

Technology development in human-computer interaction (HCI) can be
interpreted as a coevolution of tasks and artifacts. The tasks people
actually engage in (successfully of problematically) and those they wish to
engage in (or perhaps merely to imagine) define requirements for future
technology and, specifically, for new HCI artifacts. These artifacts, in
turn, open up new possibilities for human tasks, new ways to do familiar
things, and entirely new kinds of things to do. In this article, we
describe psychological design rationale as an approach to augmenting HCI
technology development and to clarifying the sense in which HCI artifacts
embody psychological theory. A psychological design rationale is an
enumeration of the psychological claims embodied by an artifact for the
situations in which it is used. As an example, we present our design work
with the View Matcher, a Smalltalk programming environment for coordinating
multiple views of an example application. In particular, we show how
psychological design rationale was used to develop a view matcher for code
reuse from prior design rationales for related programming tasks and
environments.}

Based on three years of user feedback, a design team at IRIS embarked on
a project to enhance INTERMEDIA to better support small groups of

functionality. The result of this process was the design and
implementation of InterNote. One aspect of InterNote involves a
fundamental extension to INTERMEDIA's navigational linking paradigm.
Instead of simply being able to traverse links, users are now also able to
transfer data across the links using a technique we call warm linking. In
this paper we describe extensions to our hypermedia framework to support
annotative collaboration, including the user interface of the new linking
functionality and the InterNote extension. Finally, we discuss our plans

 In this paper we discuss the Hypermedia Templates project. We first

to it. We point out some general principles for building consistent
hypermedia collections and discuss how these were reflected in the list of

This paper describes an application specific hypertext system

It implements a specific method, called Issue
Based Information Systems (IBIS), which has been developed
for use on large, complex design problems. The hypertext
system described here, gIBIS (for graphical IBIS),
makes use of color and a high speed relational database
server to facilitate building and browsing typed IBIS networks.
Further, gIBIS is designed to support the collaborative
construction of these networks by any number of
cooperating team members spread across a local area network.
Early experiments suggest that the IBIS method is
still incomplete, but there is a good match between the
tool and method even in this experimental version.}

graphical hypertext tools for conducting IBIS discussions called gIBIS and
a simple indented text notation. We describe a field trial in an
industrial setting in which the "low-tech" indented text IBIS was used to
capture more than 2,300 requirements and design decisions. We also explore
the implications of this experience for the design of computer tools that,
like gIBIS, seek to capture DR nonintrusively.}

I describe how I have used IRIS INTERMEDIA, a sophisticated hypermedia

first describe the program and summarize the pedagogical results of using
the program as documented at Brown University. I then describe various
uses of the program in the Drury class, and the observed impacts of these
uses. Our experience with hypermedia at Drury College both corroborates
and extends the pedagogical impacts of hypermedia already documented at
Brown University, especially in terms of dramatically increasing student
mastery of difficult material, and student involvement in the course
through collaborative learning strategies supported by hypermedia resources
distributed across a network. These pedagogically desirable benefits,
however, are accompanied by concerns regarding "fragmentation" and
"decentering" in student work in hypermedia, and regarding ethical
irresponsibility towards shared and thus vulnerable resources.
 These results are especially significant as they demonstrate that
instructors with relatively limited resources can nonetheless reap dramatic
pedagogical benefits from hypermedia technologies in the classroom. This
also means: relatively exotic hypermedia technologies may successfully
migrate to the resource-limited classrooms of smaller colleges and
universities.},

Documenting argumentation (i.e., design rationale) has great potential
for serving design. Despite this potential benefit, our analysis of Horst
Rittel's and Donald Schon's design theories and of our own experience has
shown that there are the following fundamental obstacles to the effective
documentation and use of a design rationale: (a) A rationale representation
scheme must be found that organizes information according to its relevance
to the task at hand; (b) computer support is needed to reduce the burden of
recording and using rationale; (c) argumentative and constructive design
activities must be linked explicitly by integrated design environments; (d)
design rationale must be reusable. In this article, we present the
evolution of our conceptual frameworks and systems toward integrated design
environments; describe a prototype of an integrated design environment,

Abstraction is the means by which information can be stored and

abstraction mechanisms in hypertext from a theoretical perspective.
Abstractions then become various first-order logic formulae. Specifically
we consider abstraction: sets, sequences, aggregations generalizations,
revisions, and information structures. Interesting results of this work
are the definition of level of generality of a hypertext node, the
demonstration of revision histories as a partial order, and the notion of
compatible-similar nodes. Also defined in this paper is the notion of
primitive hypertexts versus application hypertexts, and the usage of
attributes of nodes (illustrated by the use of keywords) across various
abstractions. An illustration of the concepts is given using the contexts
mechanism suggested by Delisle and Schwartz [DS87].}

It is argued that in order to efficiently tackle complex problems, user
and support system should intimately interact, complementing each other's
weaknesses. Strengths and limitations of human intelligence, respectively
computer intelligence, can be derived from the mechanism of associative,
respectively "chunk-based", memory. A good interactive interface should
hence allow one to translate between associative (context-dependent) and
chunk-based (formal) representations. Associative knowledge can be
expressed more explicitly through hypermedia, consisting of a network of
linked chunks. Different tools for supporting the creation of networks are
reviewed: check-lists, outlining, graphic representations, search
functions, ... Knowledge can be automatically structured by looking for
"closed" subnetworks, which define higher-order chunks and link types that
can be used to guide inferences. A prototype implementation of an
interactive interface, the CONCEPTORGANIZER, is sketched, and some
potential applications in the areas of idea processing, knowledge
elicitation, decision support, and CSCW are outlined.}

New users of four computer-mediated communication systems were asked to
indicate which of a variety of learning modes they had used, including
reading written manuals, using online automated help facilities, personal

Despite often elaborate documentation and online help, the most frequent
mode actually selected by users is trial and error learning. Rather than
bemoaning the fact that users do not make proper use of written
documentation, the implication for system implementation is that it should
be designed to effectively encourage and support trial-and-error learning.
An experimental intervention offering a guided learning activity supports

Hypertext systems are used for a variety of representational tasks, many
that involve fairly formalized structures. Because hypertext systems are
generally intended for developing informal (unstructured data) and
semi-formal (semantic networks) structures, developing more formal
structures can be difficult. Regular patterns in structures must often be
recreated from primitive elements (individual nodes and links) resulting in
a high overhead cost. In this paper we describe the Instructional Design
Environment, or IDE, a hypertext system application that facilitates the
rapid and accurate creation of regular network patterns in hypertext. IDE
focuses on the task of instructional design, but its facilities are general
and useful to many representation tasks. IDE features structure
accelerators that provide simple menu interfaces to (1) define network
structures out of patterns of typed node and link connections, (2) create
new node types that contain structured content, and (3) tailor the
interface for creating cards, links and structures to focus attention
during different stages of the representation task. These mechanisms allow
the user to tailor the hypertext environment to better meet his or her
representational needs. We also report on the field use of IDE by
instructional designers.}

This paper addresses combining hypertext with knowledge representation
as used in knowledge-based systems. Hypertext imposes explicit structure
on text, whereas certain knowledge representation formalisms of AI are
designed for structuring knowledge. We propose a way of tightly
integrating hypertext and structured object representation, using (AI)
frames for the basic representation of hypertext nodes. Moreover, we allow
for the additional option of explicit representation of structure using
partitions of hypertext nodes, which are realized as slots. In order to
make the text more dynamic, our approach facilitates some aspects of
object-oriented programming using message passing from the text in the
browser.
 The proposed tight integration is useful for design tasks, in particular
for building knowledge-based systems. According to our experience,
hypertext provides a useful intermediary representation of knowledge
between informal and formal. Based on a level of basic hypertext
functionality, we provide several features useful for supporting knowledge
acquisition. As an example of our results of using this method of
knowledge acquisition, we illustrate the strategic knowledge in our
application domain. In addition, tight integration supports important
aspects of software engineering and the user interface. Moreover, we
discuss several advantages from a hypertext point of view. In particular,
the partitions of hypertext nodes can be useful for selective inheritance
of text. In summary, both AI and hypertext will benefit from such a tight
integration.},

One purported advantage of hypertext systems is the ability to move
between semantically related parts of a document (or family of documents).
If the document is undergoing frequent modification (for example while an
author is writing a book or while a software design stored in the hypertext
system is evolving) the question arises as to how to incrementally maintain
semantic interconnections in the face of the modifications.
 The paper presents an optimal technique for the incremental maintenance
of such interconnections as a document evolves. The technique, based on
theories of information retrieval based on lexical affinities and theories
of incremental computation, updates semantic interconnections as nodes are
checked into the hypertext system (either new or as a result of an edit).
Because we use the semantic weight of lexical affinities to determine which
affinities are meaningful in the global context of the document,
introducing a new affinity or changing the weight of an existing affinity
can potentially have an effect on any node in the system. The challenge
met by our algorithm is to guarantee that despite this potentially
arbitrary impact, we still update link information optimally.
 Once established the semantic interconnections are used to allow the
user to move from node to node based not on rigid connections but instead
on dynamically determined semantic interrelationships among the nodes.},

Design Space Analysis is an approach to representing design rationale. 
It uses a semiformal notation, called QOC (Questions, Options, and
Criteria), to represent the design space around an artifact. The main
constituents of QOC are Questions identifying key design issues, Options
providing possible answers to the Questions, and Criteria for assessing and
comparing the Options. Design Space Analysis also takes account of
justifications for the design (and possible alternative designs) that
reflect considerations such as consistency, models and analogies, and
relevant data and theory. A Design Space Analysis does not produce a
record of the design process but is instead a coproduct of design and has
to be constructed alongside the artifact itself. Our work is motivated by
the notion that a Design Space Analysis will repay the investment in its
creation by supporting both the original process of design and subsequent
work on redesign and reuse by (a) providing an explicit representation to
aid reasoning about the design and about the consequences of changes to it
and (b) serving as a vehicle for communication, for example, among members
of the design team or among the original designers and later maintainers of
a system. Our work to date emphasizes the nature of the QOC representation
over processes for creating it, so these claims serve as goals rather than
objectives we have achieved. This article describes the elements of Design
Space Analysis and illustrates them by reference to analyses of existing
designs and to studies of the concepts and arguments used by designers
during design discussions.}

   ANNOTE = {
Hypertext is a technology well-suited to exploring different kinds of
representational problems. It can be used first as an informal mechanism
to describe the attributes of objects and to capture relationships between
the objects. Then hypertext structures can be constrained into a more
formal representation of a domain, model, or analytic technique. A range
of strategies for using hypertext can be employed to describe a problem and
converge on an appropriate representation; competing representations can be
informally evaluated to compare their relative expressive power.
 This paper discusses several applications that have used NoteCards, a
hypertext idea processing system, to tackle representation problems.
Examples from each problem domain have been collected using the hypertext
system as the initial acquisition vehicle. Subsequent analysis using
hypertext structuring tools has revealed the semantics of each problem
domain enabling the development of competing representations. Abstraction
of the structure and form of these representations can be used to guide
system extensions. These tailored extensions support the evaluation of a
representation's relative merits; the representation that has been
developed in response to a particular problem can be applied to analogous
problems to determine the limits of its scope.
 The first application described in this paper models a type of policy
decision-making process; the second looks at approaches to representing the
logical structure of an argument; and the third suggests some methods for
capturing the structure of a political organization as an alternative to a
conventional database design. The applications are discussed in terms of
the issues they raise and the trade-offs they involve, how hypertext-based
tools have been used to exploit the representations, and the solutions and
techniques that have been developed in the process of creating each
representation.}

It has been shown that the famous problem of user disorientation in
hypertext is not due to the concept of hypertext itself but rather
generally results from the lack of a conceptual model for hypertext
application. Unfortunately, in most hypertext systems, the weakness of
structure specification mechanisms discourages the development and use of
such a model since it is difficult to reinforce hypertext structure and to
really incorporate knowledge. A lot of works provide intelligent
mechanisms to help navigation but either they use external knowledge or
automatically synthesize links from information included in nodes which
thereby have no sufficient conceptual value.
 The present paper focuses on an object-oriented hypertext model
(implemented in the MacWeb system) using structured types to incorporate
knowledge in hypertexts. Concepts and their relationships as well as their
instances and their own relationships may be represented. Such a model
makes the capture of knowledge at source easier thus allowing a more
conceptual navigation. Furthermore, active behaviors may be associated, as
methods, to types. This provides a powerful mechanism to help develop
structured hypertext as well as task centered applications, by taking
advantage of knowledge representation.},

The long-range goal of the research reported here is to study the role

managing large amounts of information over an extended period of time.
Thus, synthesis WRITING is a task that is well-suited for testing the
potential of hypertext technologies to support work on complex tasks.
 From a case study of experts and novices, we have developed a theory of
the cognitive processes involved in producing a written synthesis. We have
also developed a preliminary theory of the role of external representations
in the WRITING process. We have drawn upon these two theories to design
several hypertext-based external representations that we believe will
augment writers' performance on a written synthesis task. The
hypertext-based applications include a general graph object and a table

support synthesis WRITING, namely, a summary graph, synthesis grid and

engineers, scientists and managers, using distance teaching and predicated
on students using their industrial base as a classroom and laboratory.
 The paper also draws a comparison between the practices of user-centred
iterative software design and the way that our course was developed.},

The goal of this paper is to investigate the dynamics of exploration as

An experiment was conducted on learning a computer system by unassisted
exploration. Five subjects with previous computer knowledge explored a
system for two hours. Their verbal comments were recorded, and the session
was videotaped and timestamped. The main results show that the exploratory
process may be decomposed into a series of work episodes which in turn may
be broken into chunks of behavioral and cognitive activity. A chunk is
centered on some task and thus includes a goal, reasoning modes, a
strategy, difficulties (frequently), and an outcome. This paper examines
that way goals are set, the strategies and reasoning modes that are
involved in exploration, and factors responsible for transitions from one
chunk to another. Recommendations for improving the explorability of

We present the conceptualization and implementation of AAA, a prototype

part of a more comprehensive effort of GMD-IPSI, where the hypertext
authoring system SEPIA (Structured Elicitation and Processing of Ideas for
Authoring) is developed. AAA will be used for writing and design
experiments the results of which will be used in the design of SEPIA. It is
designed to support the creation of argumentation patterns in accordance
with the IBIS/PHI (Procedural Hierarchical IBIS) model combined with a
micro argumentation structure according to Toulmin. For rapid prototyping
purposes it has been implemented as a hypertext system using the Writing
Environment WE developed at UNC.
 AAA uses a combination of different independent but cooperating modes of
operation dedicated to different cognitive tasks of the argumentative
writing process. The entire argumentation structure is represented as a
layered network of typed nodes and links in which different layers},

navigating such networks with a minimum of user confusion and
disorientation. The key factors in the Web View's success are a display
that combine a record of the user's path through the network with a map of
the currently available links; a scope line that summarizes the number of
documents and links in the network; and a set of commands that permit the
user to open documents directly from the Web View.},
