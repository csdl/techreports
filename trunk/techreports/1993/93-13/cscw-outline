Collaborative Filtering of Usenet

Abstract:

The daily data from Usenet overwhelms any user who tries to read more than a
minute fraction of it. Traditional filtering and retrieval techniques are
unable to address the problem of information overload. A collaborative
method coupled with an adaptive interface can radically improve the overall
interest level of information presented to a user. Using this technique,
users can spend their time understanding information, not wading through
it.

Keywords:

	collaborative filtering, adaptive interfaces, usenet, large databases

Problem:

	Description of the information overload problem in Usenet.

	- Usenet cultural background
		- Largest real-world collaboration system (fact?)
		- Anarchic, de-localized structure

	- Problems with Usenet
		- Massive volume
		- Exponential growth

	- Usenet nuts & bolts
		- Newsgroup hierarchy
		- Threading

Solution:

	Explanation of the URN approach to solving the information overload
	problem.

	- Collaborative Filtering
		- Weighting functions
		- Limitations of WF as quality selectors
		- Automated keyword extraction, and limitations
		- Collaborative keyword processing
		- New issues raised by mutually exclusive collaborative keyword selection

	- Adaptive WF generation
		- User's article ratings as training instances
		- Simple WF generation algorithm

Defense:

	Discussion and analysis of data from experiment.

	- Hypothesis

	- Method
		- Subject group
		- Length of experiment
		- Data collection technique
		- Type of data collected

	- Data
		- Graph of both interest and combined ratios over time for individuals
		- Graph of both interest and combined ratios over time for group
		- Data table?

	- Analysis
		- URN succeeded triumphantly! :)
		- [See RO 93-02 Section 3.5 for all possible outcomes]

Related Work:

	Show that this research is novel and important

	- trn, GNUS, etc (standard newsreaders)
	- strn: "Scan Threaded Read News"
	- grapeVINE ?
	- INFOSCOPE

Future Directions:

	Discuss evolving URN and relationship to other projects in CSDL

	- Collaboration!
		- Recommending articles to other users
		- Virtual moderation of newsgroups
		- Archiving, and shared archives
		- Link URN to CSRS and CLARE databases for further collaboration
	- More use of IR knowledge (dead word list, suffix stripping, etc)
	- Better WF generation algorithm
