\section{COLLABORATIVE USENET PARTICIPATION WITH URN}

To better understand the information overload problem and to explore
approaches to effective information management in Usenet, we designed,
implemented, and evaluated a collaborative system called URN.  This section
presents URN's requirements, design, implementation, and relationship
to other Usenet interfaces.  The next section will discuss our results from
its evaluation.

\subsection{Requirements}

The design of URN is influenced by the following essential requirements,
which we believe must be satisfied by any system providing effective
information management in Usenet.

\begin {itemizenoindent}

\item {\em URN must provide a representation of the user.} The range of
  domains in Usenet, and the variety of users require an effective information
  management technique to explicitly represent users and their interests.
  Given the dynamic nature of both Usenet domains and user interests, the
  representation should be adaptive and provide confidence levels. For example,
  it should distinguish between topics for which the user evidences a strong
  interest, topics for which the user evidences a strong disinterest, and topics
  for which URN has no evidence of the user's level of interest.
  
\item {\em URN must provide an improved representation of Usenet
  articles.} The effectiveness of current information management systems
  for Usenet is vastly circumscribed by the poor quality of their
  representations. This poor quality results from two features. First,
  representations at the level of newsgroups are too coarse. For example,
  comp.software-eng is too coarse a representation of a user's interests for
  effective assessment of individual article relevancy.  Second,
  representations at level of individual articles (i.e. based upon the
  Subject line or References line) is frequently inadequate or wrong.  For
  example, subject lines frequently do not fully summarize the contents, or
  even misrepresent them entirely.
  
\item {\em URN must introduce minimal overhead.} An information
  management system that introduces substantial additional overhead beyond
  that which Usenet already incurs will not be successful.  Any
  ``investment'' the user makes in terms of URN overhead must ``pay off''
  directly in terms of improved Usenet information access.
  
\item {\em URN must exploit the power of collaboration.} The preceding
  requirements create a dilemma: URN must provide new, explicit
  representations for users and information, yet do so without introducing
  excessive overhead.  We believe collaboration is the only effective means
  to increase the representational quality and expressiveness of a Usenet
  information management system without introducing excessive overhead on
  individual users.
\end {itemizenoindent}

\subsection{Design}

To satisfy these requirements, the design of URN incorporates three
intertwined design features.  First, URN provides a weighting mechanism
that explicitly represents both the level and confidence associated with
interests.  Second, URN provides a simple voting mechanism as part of its
navigation facilities that enables users to express their interest in an
article without incurring any additional overhead.  Third, URN provides a
method for users to improve the quality of representation of individual
articles by editing a default list of keywords generated automatically for
each article by URN.  Each of these design features are discussed in more
detail below.

\subsubsection{Weighting Functions}

Conceptually, a weighting function takes a feature of an article and a user
as input, and returns an integer value representing the level of interest
that the user has displayed in that feature.  Highly positive values
indicate that the user has expresses highly predictable interest in
articles with this feature, while highly negative values indicate the
reverse.  URN might represent our hypothetical Apple lover with one
weighting function that assigns a moderately negative weight to articles
related to IBM, and another weighting function that assigns a high positive
value to articles related to Apple.

Given a set of features associated with an article, a prediction of
the user's interest in an article can be made by simply summing up the
values returned by the weighting function for each feature.  The user can
then order articles by interest level (``weight'' is somewhat of a
misnomer, considering that articles with high weight rise to the top).

For example, given the weights described above, an article discussing an
Apple/IBM partnership would get a low positive rating because the moderate
negative weight associated with IBM would be added to the high positive
weight associated with Apple. Because conflicting weights indicate
representational uncertainty about the relevancy of an article to a user,
negative weighting functions make a smaller relative contribution than
equivalently positive weighting functions to the total value attributed to
an article. This means that URN tends to give higher rankings to articles
for which it has been provided with ``mixed messages''.

%%% The weighting is performed by an autonomous background process that
%%% computes the weights of all the Usenet articles in the current database for
%%% each user.  This computation is performed during off-peak hours and cached
%%% to improve the responsiveness of the system.

\begin{figure*}[t]
  {\centerline{\psfig{figure=figures/sbuff.eps}}}
  \caption{The URN Unread Article Selector.  The second column displays the
  weights assigned to each article by URN, based upon the votes applied to
  similar articles by this user in the past.  Weights of 0 typically
  indicate that URN does not have any information about the user's
  interests relevant to assessing the article.}
  \label{fig:sbuff}
\end{figure*}


\subsubsection{Voting}

Article weighting overcomes one of the problems associated with current
Usenet information practice, since it explicitly represents both interest
and non-interest at the article level.  However, manual generation and
maintainance of these values would be error-prone and introduce substantial
new overhead.  For this reason, URN completely automates the generation and
maintenance of weighting functions based upon a simple voting mechanism. To
indicate that they are finished with an article, users press one of three
keys indicating that the article was: interesting, ambivalent, or
uninteresting.  The design of explicit voting requires a careful balance
because if users are asked to do too much rating, they will become annoyed
and stop giving useful ratings.  While some interest level information
might be inferred indirectly from user actions (such as not completely
displaying the entire article before moving on to the next one), the more
simple strategy of explicit voting appears more robust.  We believe that
our three level rating system presents a low enough overheard that that
users will make use of it.

The next section on the implementation of URN describes in detail how 
votes are transformed into weighting functions. 

\subsubsection{Collaborative Article Representation}

A second problem introduced by weighting functions is the requirement for
each article to be represented in terms of a set of features.  As noted
previously, a fundamental problem with Usenet is that it encompasses a
virtually unbounded set of domains, and the structure imposed upon
individual articles is insufficient for both precise and accurate
representation of article content.  To resolve this, URN generates a
default list of keywords to be associated with each article, which can then
be edited by any user to better conform to the true content of an article.
This keyword-based representation of article content is shared by all
users, which means that the overhead of its construction and maintenance is
also shared among all users.  

Having now overviewed the essential requirements and major design features
of URN, the next section presents details of its implementation.


\subsection{Implementation}

URN is implemented using Egret, a Unix/X-window environment for the
implementation of exploratory collaborative hypertext applications
\cite{csdl-91-03,csdl-92-01}.  Egret consists of a 20 KLOC server process
written in C++, which communicates via TCP/IP to Lucid Emacs clients
extended with 15 KLOC of Lisp. The URN application specializes Egret to
Usenet with approximately four additional KLOC of Lisp.

\subsubsection{Inputting Articles}

URN keeps its own database of Usenet articles. Articles are read into the
URN database periodically by an agent process via the NNTP protocol
\cite{rfc977}.  As it reads in each article, keywords are extracted from
the header of the article. The header fields Subject, Summary, Author, and
Keywords from the original article are parsed into separate words. Next
``noise'' words (such as ``the'', ``or'', ``and'') are removed and the words
are converted to lower case.  These words are then stored with the article,
and are called the article's keywords. We keep track of how many unique
keywords are in the database, and the frequency of each keyword. Articles
in a thread contain hypertext links to their neighbors.

\subsubsection{User Interface}

Once there are articles in the database, users connect to the database
through an URN client. After connection, they are shown a list of all the
articles in the database, sorted in descending order by weight (see Figure
\ref{fig:sbuff}). Users click on any article from the list to retrieve and
display it. Articles are displayed similarly to other news readers: the
header lines are on the top, followed by the list of hyperlinks and
keywords, and then the body of the article (see Figure \ref{fig:nbuff}).

\begin{figure*}[t]
  {\centerline{\psfig{figure=figures/nbuff.eps}}}
  \caption{An Article Displayed with URN. Articles are displayed along
  with a field containing a list of keywords representing the
  collaboratively built, consensual representation of the content of this
  article.}
  \label{fig:nbuff}
\end{figure*}

From any article, the user can click on any of the highlighted links to
move to the related article.  The user may also select any keyword in the
Keywords field and delete it, or select text from the body of the article
and add it to the Keywords field (Free-form entry of keywords not found in
the article is also supported.) In this way, users collaboratively build a
consensual representation of the contents of each article. In fact, one
user may vote on an article, and later on another user may change the
keywords associated with that article.  URN will then recalculate the
weighting functions associated with the first user to correspond to the
improved representation of the article.

After reading the article, the user votes on the article as either:
interesting, ambivalent, or uninteresting. This vote is recorded, and the user
goes on to the next article in this thread. When users finish reading articles,
they disconnect from the URN database to end their URN session.

\subsubsection{Keyword Agent}

After users vote on articles, a background process called the Keyword Agent
takes their votes and turns them into weights. First, the agent reads a
list of all keywords that have been manually added by users. The bodies of
all articles in the database are then scanned for these words, and if any
are found then those keywords are ``promoted'' to the Keywords field for
the article it was found in. User keywords are treated this way because URN
assumes that user-added keywords are more relevant than automatically-added
keywords, and less likely to be bogus. The net effect is that if a user
adds a keyword to an article, then the keyword is added to all other
articles in the database containing that keyword in their body.

Next, the Keyword Agent uses each user's votes to generate their weighting
functions. URN's weighting functions are currently quite simple: a keyword
and its associated weight. For each user of the system, URN assembles a
list of all the articles that they voted as interesting.  URN then builds a
list of all of the keywords from those articles, noting the frequency of
each keyword. This is called the ``goodlist''.  URN does the same thing for
articles that were voted as uninteresting, resulting in the ``badlist''.
URN then compares the two lists and eliminates any keyword that appears in
both lists.  For each keyword in the goodlist, URN computes a weight using
the following formula:

\begin{displaymath}
W_g = f_l \cdot \frac{1}{f_g}
\end{displaymath}

where $W_g$ is the weight computed, $f_l$ is the local frequency of this
keywords, and $f_g$ is the global frequency of this keyword. The local
frequency of a keyword is simply the number of times it appeared in the
goodlist. The global frequency of a keyword is the number of times it appeared
in the whole database. By taking the product of the local frequency with the
inverse of the global frequency, URN generates higher weights for rare
words, and lower weights for more ubiquitous words
\cite{cacm-infofiltering-92}.

For each keyword in the badlist, URN computes a weight using the following
formula:

\begin{displaymath}
W_b = - f_l \cdot \frac{1}{f_g} \cdot \frac{8}{10}
\end{displaymath}

where the variables are defined similarly to $W_g$. Note that bad weights
are negative, and that for any given $f_l$ and $f_g$, $W_b$ will be smaller
in magnitude than $W_g$ due to the constant term in the calculation of
$W_b$.  As stated previously, URN does this to bias the system toward
presenting irrelevant articles with false positive weights rather than
missing relevant articles with false negative weights.

Importantly, all the weighting functions are dynamic: they are recomputed
each time the Keyword Agent runs. This allows the weights of articles to
change over time as user interests change or new information about the user
is provided.

Once all individual weighting functions are generated, the Keyword Agent
computes the new weights of all articles in the database for each user. For
each article, the agent compares the list of keywords for that article to
the list of weighting functions for a user. If there is a match, then that
weighting function's weight is added to that user's weight for the article.


\subsection{Other Usenet Readers}

Many different programs have been written to read Usenet. What follows is a
brief survey of some that are related to URN's goals.

\subsubsection{trn, GNUS, etc.}

These are the standard programs used by most Usenet users. They allow
subscription to newsgroups and threads are explicitly represented. Typically a
user will be shown a list of all the threads from a group, and the user can
select any number to be read. The only filtering technique provided is kill
files. There is primitive support for the automated creation of kill files
(i.e. a user may ask to have the Subject line from the article they are reading
deposited in their kill file). There is no support for signalling articles as
especially interesting, nor is there any kind of collaboration support.

\subsubsection{strn.}

``Scan Threaded Read News'' is an enhanced version of trn. It adds the
concept of virtual newsgroups which are categorizations of newsgroups by
certain search criteria, and assigning ``scores'' to articles by patterns
(similar to URN's weighting functions). Its scores can only be based on
the header lines of an article, and they must be created manually. There is
some collaborative potential available through sharing of ones' virtual
newsgroup index files.

\subsubsection{INFOSCOPE.}

This newsreading tool allows the creation of virtual newsgroups
via filtering \cite{chi-infoscope-91,cacm-infoscope-92}. The filters are
generated by background agents that monitor users' activity and display their
findings to the user, who can either accept or reject them.  The filtering is
performed on individual users and INFOSCOPE does not provide any collaboration
support.  The filters are a subset of boolean logic, and they only search
header lines. It also provides a graphical user interface for browsing through
the Usenet hierarchy. Because it derives all its information about articles
through the header lines, it cannot determine that a thread's contents have
changed from the actual Subject line.

\subsubsection{Tapestry.}

This collaborative document filtering tool \cite{cacm-tapestry-92} contains a
complex query language (TQL) which users can use to write their own queries.
Filters written in TQL can access ``annotations'' or ``endorsements'' created
by other users in order to filter a message. These endorsements are similar to
votes in URN, and allow for ``virtual moderation'' of newsgroups. However,
filters must all be created manually by the user using TQL. Articles are only
prioritized for display in the last step of the Tapestry process using a email
client program that does not have access to the full TQL language.
