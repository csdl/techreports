\begin{abstract}
  
  Usenet is an example of the potential and problems of the nascent National
  Information Infrastructure. While Usenet makes an enormous amount of useful
  information available to its users, the daily data overwhelms any user who
  tries to read more than a fraction of it. This paper presents a
  collaboration-oriented approach to information classification and
  evaluation for very large, dynamic database structures such as Usenet. Our
  approach is implemented in a system called URN, a multi-user,
  collaborative, hypertextual Usenet reader.  We show that this collaborative
  method, coupled with an adaptive interface, radically improves the overall
  relevance level of information presented to a user.
