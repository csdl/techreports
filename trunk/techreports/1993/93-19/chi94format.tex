\section{INTRODUCTION}

The Conference Proceedings and Conference Companion represent the 
final archival records of the conference. As in previous years, we 
are striving to give the book a single, high quality appearance. To 
do this, authors must follow some simple guidelines.


In essence, we ask you to make your paper look exactly like this 
document. You should match the type style, type size, line spacing, 
indentation, and layout format as closely as you can. In fact, if you 
received this document online, you can use it as a template. Just 
replace the text by your text, while keeping the same format. To get 

a RTF or LaTeX version of this document send an electronic mail to:
CHI94-format@bellcore.com.

Use an A4 or 8.5''x11'' sheet of paper. 
Center the image on the page. The whole image of your text should 
absolutely fit in a 17.8 cm x 24 cm box (7'' by 9 1/4''). Your 
submitted material will be photographed 1-to-1 (no reduction) for 
printing. We have included here recommendations to help you match this 
sample with the facilities you might have, such as Script, Microsoft 
Word on Macintosh or PC, MacWrite, or an impact printer.

\section{TITLE AND AUTHORS}
The title, author's names and affiliations run across the full width 
of the page. We also recommend phone number and e-mail address, if 
available. (See the top of this page for  two names with different 
addresses. If only one address needed, center all text in the page)



\begin{itemize}
\item Title area: 1~column, 5.9~cm~(2~1/3'') length, 17.8~cm~(7'') width.

\item Title: bold 18 point helvetica - mixed cases

\item  Names: italic 12 point times roman 

\item Addresses, Tel, E-Mail: plain 12 point times roman
\end{itemize}



Do not say ``first contact'' in the papers or summaries, only on the cover sheet.

\section{RE: THE ABSTRACT}
Each paper should begin with an abstract, followed by a set of 
keywords, both placed in the left column of the first page under the 
left half of the title. This abstract does not have to be the same as 
the 100 word abstract that some categories have to submit separately. 

\section{FIRST PAGE COPYRIGHT NOTICE}
Remember to leave at least 2.5 cm (1'') of blank space at the bottom  
of  the  left column  of  the first  page,  as  on this page. You must 
leave this space for the copyright notice on ALL submissions intended 
for publication in the proceedings or companion (i.e. papers as well 
as the one or two page summaries).  Please note that all the authors 
of all accepted papers and summaries will have to sign a copyright 
release form.  Those forms will be sent with the acceptance letters 
and need to be returned rapidly.  We encourage the contact persons of 
each submission to keep track of their co-authors' locations because 
they will be responsible for rapidly collecting the signatures.

\section{NUMBER OF PAGES:}
Submissions in different categories have different 
page limits. These limits refer to the total number of pages including 
the pages made of color images (plates).


\begin{itemize}
\item Papers: 7 pages maximum
\item SIGs and Workshops: 1 page summary
\item All Others (videos, demos, 
short papers, tutorials, posters, panels, interactive experience and 
organization overviews):  2 page summary
\end{itemize}

\section{TWO COLUMNS}
After the title use a double-column format as shown 
here. Column width is 8.5 cm, with 0.8 cm between columns (for a total 
image width still equal to 17.8 cm).  Total text length should remain 
between 23.2 and 24 cm (9 1/4'') Right margins should be justified, 
not ragged.   Separate each paragraph by a blank line (and do not 
indent them)  Hyphenation is at your own discretion.  The two columns 
of the last page should be of equal length. 


\section{SECTIONS}
The title of a section should be in Helvetica 9 point bold in all 
capitals.  Notice that the sections are not numbered!  

\subsection{Subsections}
The title of subsections should be in Helvetica 9 point bold with only 
the initial letters capitalized. (Note: Words like ``the'' and ``a'' 
are not capitalized.)

\subsubsection{Subsubsections}
The heading 
for subsubsections should be in Helvetica 9 point italics with initial 
letters capitalized. (Note: Words like ``the'' and ``a'' are not 
capitalized.)  Here the heading is not followed by a return.


\section{TYPESET TEXT}
Papers should be prepared on a typesetter or word processor.  Please 
do not use your favorite obscure font.  We want to produce a book that 
looks like a book, not like many dissimilar papers thrown together.  
Please use a 10 point Times Roman font, or other Roman font with 
serifs, as close as possible in appearance to Times Roman in which 
these guidelines have been set.  The target is to have a 10 point type 
set on an 11 point line, as you see here.  Do not use a sans-serif 
font (e.g., {Helvetica)} except for emphasis, headings and 
the title.  The Press 10 point font available to users of Script is a 
most acceptable substitute for Times Roman.  If actual Times Roman is 
not available, users might try font Computer Modern Roman.  Macintosh 
users should use the font named Times.

If you do not have a laser printer, try to borrow 
one, rent one, or make friends with somebody who has one.  In some 
cases you might be able to bring a disk to a business that will print 
your document for you.   If you really cannot use a laser printer send 
your submission on the best alternative printer you have.  As a very 
last resort, if typesetting facilities are not available, papers can 
be typewritten on a typewriter.  In this case, the text must be 
prepared on larger pages and then reduced 25\%.  



\section{FIGURES}
Figures must be inserted at the appropriate point in your text (Figure 
1).  Figures can extend over the two columns up to 17.8 cm (7'') if 
necessary.  Black and white photographs (not Polaroid prints) may be 
mounted on the camera-ready paper with glue or double-sided tape.  
(Please note that even clear tape mounted over figures or text will 
cause a noticeable smudge; attach figures only from behind.)

\begin{figure}
\unitlength 1mm
\framebox(85,30){\large FIGURE}
\caption{an example of figure caption. It is set in helvetica 9 point,
with a small 0.5cm indentation.}
\end{figure}

For better quality you can have stats or screened 
velox prints that are about 150 lines per inch prepared by your local 
printing service.  Of course you can do it yourself with a good 
scanner.  Remember that some readers may never see anything other than 
a poor photocopy of your paper, so make sure that the figure will 
still be readable (try to see how it looks after recopying it a couple 
of times).

\section{COLOR IMAGES (PLATES)}
Color images (plates) must be placed on separate pages at the end of 
your submission. They are grouped on separate pages so that in the 
proceedings they may be collected into a single color section. 
Consider carefully whether you really prefer color: black and white 
images, which you prepare and place as they will appear within the 
rest of your submission, may be as meaningful and nice as color images 
separated from your text.

Color plate captions are to be the author(s)' last 
names followed by a comma (,) and a plate number (e.g., Jones, Smith, 
Color Plate 1). Captions of color plates are to be used when referring 
to them in the text (e.g. See Smith, Color Plate 4).

Slides and transparencies are the preferred methods 
of submitting color material for camera ready materials (on the other 
hand the copies for review should have paper prints). We will not be 
able to return any of these materials. Please do not submit color 
xerographic copies of photographs. 

\section{REFERENCES AND CITATIONS}
Use the standard CACM format for references, i.e., a numbered list at 
the end of the article, ordered alphabetically by first author, and 
referenced by number in brackets [2]. (See the examples of citations 
at the end of this section or other examples in the April 93 issue of 
the Communications of the ACM, page 135). References should be 
materials accessible to the public (i.e., articles in standard 
journals and open conference proceedings.)  Internal technical reports 
should be avoided unless easily accessible (i.e. you can give the 
address to obtain it).  Private communications should be acknowledged, 
not referenced.

\section{HEADERS, FOOTERS AND PAGE NUMBERING}
Do not use headers, footers or footnotes. Page numbers, footers and 
headers will be added when the Conference Proceedings and Companion 
are assembled. Papers submitted to the paper chairs for review should 
have page numbers (to help the review process).  But do NOT put 
numbers on the two page summaries.

\section{PROCEEDINGS AND COMPANION}
Records of the events of CHI~'94 will be published in two volumes.  
The Proceedings and the Companion will be  distributed to all 
conference participants and will be sold by ACM. The Proceedings 
volume will also be distributed to all members of SIGCHI as well as a 
large number of libraries. 

\section{OTHER CONSIDERATIONS}
\subsection{No Private Material.}
Presentations may not contain any proprietary or confidential 
material. Please clear all materials before submitting or presenting 
them.  Submission of pictures of identifiable people should be done 
only with the understanding that responsibility for collection of 
appropriate permissions rests with the submitter not CHI'94.

\subsection{Equations}
Displayed equations should be centered, with 
optional equation numbers right-justified to the right margin of the column.

\subsection{Spelling}
Spelling may follow any dialect of English (e.g., British, 
Canadian, or American) but please use it consistently.

\subsection{Language}
The language of CHI '94 is English for an international 
audience. Avoid puns and  slang. English will not be the mother 
tongue of many readers (and reviewers).  Today, part of striking the 
right tone is also handling gender-linked terms sensitively.  Avoid 
gender specific expressions when unnecessary.  But also try to avoid 
the awkward he/she or her/his.  Consider the plural or replace third 
person singular possessives with articles (e.g. ``a'' rather than 
``his'').  Occasionally  passive forms can be used.

\section{ATTENTION POSTERS AND SHORT PAPERS}
Unlike the other 
participation styles Posters and Short Papers have a late submission 
deadline and require original camera

% The horrible cut to get nice even columns
\newpage

ready documents to be submitted 
(with extra copies for reviewing). Posters and Short Paper authors 
should be extremely attentive to the formatting directives as there will
be no time for revisions and the summaries will be published ``as 
is''.  We do need clean originals. Please include some stiff material 
(e.g., cardboard) in your envelope to prevent bending in transit.

\section{ACKNOWLEDGMENTS}
The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of many 
previous editors in the writing and formatting of this document.


\section{NOTE:}
The Call for Participation listed the title as 
all capitals and the figures captions as helvetica 7 points with 1 cm 
indentation.  We find those characteristics inappropriate so please 
ignore those two items and use whatever is requested and shown in this 
detailed document.
