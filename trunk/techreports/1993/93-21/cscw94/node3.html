RESRA, which stands for ``REpresentational Schema of Research Artifacts,''
is a semi-structured knowledge representation language designed
specifically to facilitate collaborative learning from scientific text,
such as research papers. It has the following design goals:
<P>
<UL><LI> An organizational tool that allows incremental, fine-grained
  representation and integration of scientific artifacts;<LI> A mapping tool that highlights essential thematic features and
  relationships within and across scientific text, and that helps
  expose gaps and ambiguities in existing knowledge;<LI> A communication tool and a shared frame of reference that
  highlights similarities and differences between learners'
  points of view; and<LI> A tool for learning about the norms and conventions governing formal
  communication of scientific knowledge.
</UL>
<P>
To achieve these goals, RESRA defines three types of conceptual constructs:
<I>node primitives</I>, <I>link primitives</I>, and <I>canonical
forms</I>. Node primitives represent discrete thematic features of the
artifact, for example, <I>claim</I>, <I>concepts</I>, and <I>
theory</I>. They also explicitly represent the learner's points of view in
terms of <I>critiques</I>, <I>questions</I> and <I>suggestions</I>.
<P>
Link primitives describe relationships between thematic features
represented by node primitives. For example, in a research paper, a <I>
claim</I> is typically made with respect to a particular <I>problem</I> and
must be supported by some <I>evidence</I>. In RESRA, these relationships
are expressed as ``<I>claim</I>  <I>problem''</I> and ``<I>evidence</I>
 <I>claim</I>,'' where <I>
responds-to</I> and <I>supports</I> are link primitives.
<P>
The canonical form characterizes typical artifact-level thematic structures
as a directed graph of RESRA node and link primitives. Research artifacts
are classified into various types, such as <I>concept</I>, <I>empirical</I>,
and <I>survey</I> papers. For each of these artifact types, a
stereotypical RESRA structural graph can be identified. For example, in
software engineering, one important type of research artifact is an
``experience paper''. Such artifacts report the experience of an
organization with a software package or strategy, including the problem it
attempted to solve or alleviate, the initial justification for adopting
that software or strategy, and how the actual outcome compared to the
expected result. In RESRA, a canonical form for experience reports could be
expressed as shown in Figure <A HREF="node3.html#figexperiencecrf"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.

<P>
<P>
Learners in software engineering may use the above structural model as a
``template'' to guide their interpretation and evaluation of all experience
papers in that domain, and their efforts in constructing their own
experience papers so that they may also conform to the same structure. In a
group setting, such structural knowledge can be used as a shared framework
for learners to engage in discussions about the content of related
artifacts.
<P>
RESRA is based upon three premises: (1) Human knowledge can be represented
in term of a small number of node and link primitives; (2) The use of these
primitives to characterize scientific artifacts and subsequent group
activities are a meaningful learning process; and (3) Different learners
are likely to generate different representations of the same artifact; by
comparing these representations, one can discern the similarities and
differences in points of view held by individual learners.

Figure <A HREF="node3.html#tabresra"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> provides a synopsis of all RESRA node primitives,
while Figure <A HREF="node3.html#figsumresra"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> graphically depicts relationships
between representative RESRA node and link primitives.

Figure <A HREF="node3.html#figfagan"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows an example use of RESRA that summarizes a
seminal paper on software code inspection [<A HREF="node15.html#Fagan76">8</A>].  The <EM>source</EM>
node in the upper left corner provides a reference to the artifact under
study. The paper addresses one <EM>problem</EM>, against which three <EM>
claim</EM>s are made. To support these <EM>claim</EM>s, the author introduces
three <EM>concept</EM>s and two <EM>method</EM>s. The latter are used to generate
<EM>evidence</EM>, which in turn supports two out of the three <EM>claim</EM>s.

Several interesting observations can be made about Figure <A HREF="node3.html#figfagan"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>.
First, the representation captures what is important in the research paper:
it is not simply an outline of the paper but rather a map of its knowledge
structure that reflects the learner's mental model about the author's
intent. Second, as discussed later in this paper, different learners will
derive quite different representations of this same artifact. Figure
<A HREF="node3.html#figfagan"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> is merely one of many possible representations. By
comparing and contrasting these distinct representations, one can gain a
better understanding of not only what this artifact is really about but
perhaps more interestingly, how different learners interpret the same
content. Third, also as described later, constructing these representations
is non-trivial and requires significant learner effort, since RESRA node
primitives, such as the <EM>problem</EM> node in Figure <A HREF="node3.html#figfagan"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A>, may
be only implied rather than explicitly stated by the author. Thus, the
learner must infer these objects from the context of the paper, and relate
them to other RESRA objects. Deriving such a representation is a meaningful
learning experience because learners must ask
themselves many deep-level questions: what is the claim(s) being
made? With respect to what problem? Is a given theme a <I>claim</I> or
<I>theory</I>? How are those themes related? Are there any ``orphan'' or
unconnected themes?  Answers to these and other related questions reveal
what the artifact really means to individual learners.
