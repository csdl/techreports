CLARE, which stands for ``Collaborative Learning And Research
Environment,'' is a distributed learning environment that supports SECAI
and RESRA.  It is a client-server system, running in a Unix/X-windows
environment, and is built on top of the EGRET framework for exploratory
collaboration [<A HREF="node15.html#csdl9201">11</A>, <A HREF="node15.html#csdl9309">12</A>].
<P>
Use of CLARE begins by converting the scientific text to be studied into
CLARE's internal hypertext format. Typically, the full text of the document
is split up into smaller chunks called <I>source nodes</I>, each one
corresponding to a physical section or subsection of the document. The
current implementation of CLARE does not provide support for graphical
images, so tables and figures are shown in the hypertext network as logical
references and supplied to the learners as hardcopy documents.
<P>
Figure <A HREF="node5.html#figexplore"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows a snapshot of the CLARE user interface
during the exploration phase. The left window shows a source node
corresponding to one section of the artifact under study.  The node is
connected to other source nodes via the <I>Up</I>, <I>Next</I>, and <I>
Prev</I> links displayed on the first line of that node.  Learners navigate
through the scientific artifact under study by following these links.
<P>
To summarize a paragraph or any arbitrary block of text, the learner first
highlights the text by dragging the mouse over it, and then selects the
corresponding node type from the <I>Summarize</I> menu. CLARE creates a
new node of the chosen type (e.g., <EM>problem</EM>, <EM>evidence</EM>) with
default field template, and displays it in the lower right window. An
explicit link is also automatically added between the selected text in the
left window and the newly created node. The learner then provides
annotative comments about the summarization in the <B>Description</B> field.
<P>
The above process is repeated until the learners believe they have fully
summarized the document. (Summary nodes may also be created without
reference to any text in the artifact.)  Evaluation nodes are created
analogously, although both source nodes and summary nodes may serve as
targets of evaluation.  The learner adds RESRA link primitives between two
eligible nodes by choosing <I>Link Mode</I> from the <I>Summarize</I>
menu. The upper right window in Figure <A HREF="node5.html#figexplore"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows what the
current learner has created so far for the current artifact.

Figure <A HREF="node5.html#figconsolidate"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows a snapshot of the CLARE user interface
during the consolidation phase. The upper left window displays a
comparative view of the <EM>problem</EM> instances created by three learners
(Peter, Cam, and Rose) during exploration. It highlights the differences
and similarities between these learners with respect to their views on the
problem the original authors attempt to address. Similar comparisons can
also be made for the other RESRA primitives, for example, <I>claim</I>, <I>
evidence</I>.  To see the actual node instance corresponding to a given entry,
the learner mouse clicks on the bold italicized text.  If a learner then
wants to know the precise place in the artifact from which the
summarization node was derived, he can follow the link in the <B>
Summarization</B> field.
<P>
To raise a question or make a critique on the <EM>problem</EM> node, one
selects the corresponding RESRA node type from the <I>Argument</I> menu in
the lower right window. This creates a new node instance of that type and
links it to the <EM>problem</EM> node.  When the creator of the <EM>problem</EM>
node sees this new link, he can explain or defend his position using a
similar procedure. He might also declare his <EM>problem</EM> as <I>
similar-to</I> another node using the <I>Integrate</I> menu.
<P>
The upper-right window in Figure <A HREF="node5.html#figconsolidate"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> summarizes the state
of all learner's work. For example, Peter has created ten <EM>claim</EM>
nodes, while Cam has seven, and Rose has six. Clicking on an entry
generates a detailed listing for the corresponding user, from which
individual node instances for any learner can be retrieved.

In addition to these computational services, CLARE also includes an
instrumentation mechanism that unobtrusively gathers fine-grained process
data. Each time the user performs a semantically interesting action, such
as creating a new node or link, a timestamp representing this event and the
time at which it occurred is recorded. The instrumentation also detects
periods of idle-time for correcting elapsed-time calculations.  This
instrumentation provides vital data for answering such process-level
questions as: what is the sequence in which learners visit nodes, and does
this navigation strategy differ among learners? How much time do learners
spend on each portion of the document? How much time do learners spend on
each activity of SECAI?  How are node creation and the link creation
related procedurally?  Answering these and other questions was the goal of 
a set of experiments we performed using CLARE, discussed next.
