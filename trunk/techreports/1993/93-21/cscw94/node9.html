<P>
The post-session survey responses from the subjects show that CLARE is a
novel and useful collaborative learning tool: approximately 70% of
learners indicated CLARE helped them understand the content of research
papers in a way not possible before, and nearly 80% of learners indicated
that CLARE helped them understand their peers' perspectives in a way not
possible before. Approximately 84% of the learners found that RESRA
provides a useful means for characterizing the important content of
research papers, and 90% of the learners agreed that RESRA helped expose
different points of view on the same artifact.
<P>
Responses from the post-session survey also assessed the usefulness of
individual components of our approach. The RESRA node primitives and the
SECAI learning model were ranked the highest, assessed by 82% and 70% of
the users, respectively, as ``very'' or ``extremely'' useful. The least
useful features were the online examples, assessed by 25% of the users as
``not'' useful. RESRA canonical forms, the comparison mode, and link
primitives were received mixed reactions from the user.
<P>
In addition to the empirical data, subjective responses to the approach
were revealing.  The following response from a subject shows that, in at
least one instance, CLARE succeeded in fostering meaningful learning:

<BLOCKQUOTE> <I>``... I don't quite know how to use
  it [CLARE] very well yet, but it
  really helped me get more out 
  of the artifact we read.  Without
  CLARE I would have just read the
  artifact and not really studied it
  or learned about the subject. CLARE
  made me look at the artifact from
  another point of view.  That point of
  view was what is the author trying to
  tell me and how is the author
  trying to tell me that information ...
  Before I used CLARE I just read the
  artifacts.  Now using CLARE I look
  for the meaning of the artifact and
  learn more about the subject...''</I>
