SECAI, which stands for ``Summarization, Evaluation, Comparison,
Argumentation, and Integration,'' defines an explicit process model for
collaborative learning from scientific text. Figure <A HREF="node4.html#figsecai"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> shows
how these activities are related together to support collaborative
knowledge construction. The world outside the concentric circles consists
of various types of scientific artifacts, which constitute the raw material of
learning.  Metaphorically, collaborative learning with SECAI pulls learners
from an external, isolated, and individual position inward toward an
internal, integrated, and collaborative perspective on the artifact.
<P>
The first phase of SECAI is called <I>exploration</I>, which consists of two
activities: <I>summarization</I> and <I>evaluation</I>. During this
phase, learners derive a personal representation of the artifact and an
evaluation of its content, both expressed in terms of RESRA. This phase is
performed <I>privately</I> - learners are not allowed to see what other
learners are doing or have done.  This policy prevents learners from being
distracted by each other's work or from free-riding off the work of others.
The result of exploration is a set of representations similar to that shown
in Figure <A HREF="node3.html#figfagan"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> (except for the addition of evaluation nodes).
<P>
The second phase of SECAI is called <I>consolidation</I>, which consists of
three activities: <I>comparison</I>, <I>argumentation</I>, and <I>
integration</I>. During comparison, learners evaluate the similarities and
differences between their representation and those of other learners.
Comparison is done at three levels: the artifact level, the link primitive
level, and the node primitive level.  At the artifact level, learners
compare their classifications of the artifact type, such as whether the
artifact appears to be a <I>concept paper</I> or an <I>experience
report</I>. In addition, they also compare their representations with
respect to the canonical form selected for the artifact to see how their
representations deviate from the standard one. At the link primitive level,
learners compare their derived relationships, such as each learner's
interpretation of the supporting evidence for a claim. Finally, at the node
primitive level, learners compare their instantiations of nodes and the
artifact content referenced by them.
<P>
Comparison activities provide a basis for <I>argumentation</I>. For
example, suppose that John compares his representation to Jane's, and
determines that his representation contains a <EM>problem</EM> node that is
apparently missing from Jane's representation.  He might then generate a
<EM>critique</EM> node concerning Jane's representation, noting that it is
missing an important problem raised in the artifact.  Jane might respond by
agreeing that her representation omitted an important problem.
Alternatively, Jane might respond that one of her <EM>problem</EM> nodes in
fact subsumes the problem noted by John.  Another potential response might
be to disagree with John's interpretation of the artifact content as a
problem: that it was actually a method or claim of the research, as
described in Jane's representation. This process of comparison and
argumentation leads to an improved understanding of the meaning of the
artifact. Perhaps as importantly, it reveals other learners' perspectives
on the artifact.
<P>
The final step in the consolidation phase is <I>integration</I>, where
learners create explicit links between their individual representations to
improve their collective coherence and consistency. Going back to our
hypothetical learners, if Jane realized that John had correctly identified
a problem missing from her representation, she could integrate her
representation by linking John's <EM>problem</EM> node into her representation
in the appropriate places.  Alternatively, if Jane believed that one of her
<EM>problem</EM> nodes subsumed the problem identified by John, she could
integrate his representation by creating an <EM>is-part-of</EM> link between
his and her nodes.
<P>
The large shaded arrows in Figure <A HREF="node4.html#figsecai"><IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/figs/cross_ref_motif.gif"></A> indicate the direction in
which SECAI ``pushes'' the group process: as learners proceed through the
various activities, the level of collaboration among learners increases
and, concurrently, a group knowledge base emerges.  This dynamic knowledge
base articulates both areas of consensus and areas of disagreements among a
group of learners as they summarize, evaluate, compare, deliberate, and
integrate their individual perspectives on the learning artifact.
