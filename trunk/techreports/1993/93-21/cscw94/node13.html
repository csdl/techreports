This paper presents findings on a computer-based approach for supporting
learning as a process of collaborative knowledge-building.  The system,
CLARE, differs from other learning systems in three important ways. First,
it provides a semi-structured knowledge representation language that serves
as a shared meta-cognitive framework to facilitate communication and
collaboration among learners. Second, it defines an explicit process model
of collaborative learning. Third, it implements fine-grained
instrumentation mechanisms to gather detailed process data concerning the
behavior of its users.
<P>
Analysis of experimental data confirms that CLARE is a novel environment
that fosters meaningful learning. It shows that RESRA and SECAI provide
useful structural and process-level guidance on how to collaboratively
construct knowledge. In addition, analysis also reveals a number of issues
for further research.
<P>
First, computer-supported collaborative learning is still a quite recent
phenomenon for which no coherent theoretical frameworks yet exist. Many
current learning theories, such as the ones on which CLARE is based, do not
explicitly address such essential issues as how people develop shared
mental models of the same artifact or problem situation, how to deal with
differing terminologies for the same construct, and so on. As evidenced
from the CLARE experimental result, these problems are intrinsic and also
essential to collaborative knowledge-building, and cannot be answered by
simply extrapolating proposals from individual-based learning
theories. Hence, new and better theoretical explanations and guidance are
called for.
<P>
Second, collaborative learning is not confined to classroom settings or
scientific artifacts. Rather, it is part of every work situation in which
artifact-based collaboration is required, such as software development,
business proposal development, and so forth. Our long-term goal is to
develop computer-supported environments that foster collaborative learning
across task domains through tailorable structural and process-level
support. RESRA and SECAI represent the first step in this direction.
<P>
Finally, we intend to apply CLARE's approach to collaborative learning as a
means to assess the quality of the research/learning artifact and to help
authors improve the quality of the artifacts they create. We hypothesize
that a good scientific artifact contains a clearly-articulated knowledge
structure and thus is easier to summarize using CLARE than a bad artifact.
As a simple test of this hypothesis, we invite you--our readers--to
contemplate a RESRA representation of this paper, and send us your
assessments and discoveries.
