\opening {Dear Professor Knight,}

Enclosed please find a pre-publication version of a paper I recently
completed entitled ``Design for Instrumentation: High Quality Measurement
of Formal Technical Review''.  This paper was submitted to IEEE Computer
for their special issue on metrics and measurement.

I reference your work on Phased Inspections and the INSPEQ environment in
this submission, and wanted to provide you with an opportunity to review
this paper and correct any errors or omissions I may have made.  I also
believe that our own work on CSRS may be of interest to you.  There is an
internet mailing list that I would be happy to put you on if you so desire.

Finally, I am teaching a graduate seminar on FTR methods this Spring, and
would be very interested in getting a copy of INSPEQ to use in our
classroom if this is possible.  (I understand completely if this is not
possible; CSRS is not yet available for external, unguided installation.)

Thanks very much, and I look forward to your comments on our research.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
