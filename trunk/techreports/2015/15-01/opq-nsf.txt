Crowd sourced data

	- Research issues
		- Geo-tag determination
			- Can we determine accurate crowd sourced data while maintaining privacy?
		- Report verification
			- Can the data we receive be verified?
			- Is this a problem if all of the devices use SSL?
		- Automated report summarization
			- What types of summarizations of data can we perform algorithmically?
			- Maybe ... (the following are my own ideas, not from the paper)
				- Power quality for a particular neighborhood over a specified period of time
				- Correlated power quality information with weather data
				- Personal PQ summary over some period of time
				- Automated reports of near by power events (we're already doing this)
		- Spatial-Temporal Mining for Social Behavior Prediction
			- Can we use our crowd sourced data to predict future power events?
				- Can we use future weather models to predict future PQ?
				- Can we detect cascading power events over a geographical area before it happens?
					- And if so, is there enough time to issue any kind of warnings or take corrective actions?
		- Scalability and safety
			- Does our system scale with many distributed devices?
			
	-Disaggregated End-Use Energy Sensing for the Smart Grid
	- http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.187.8177&rep=rep1&type=pdf
		- Authors argue that home users don't understand their power consumption
			- Can we gauge how well home owners understand their power quality?
		- Can we use power quality data for disaggregation information?
			- It looks like yes, this paper discusses several tecniques such as voltage signatures
		- Would a distributed view of power disaggregation be useful?
			- For instance, if we see an event every time someone turns on a GE washer machine, can we 
			  learn about it's signature, tag it, and then identify the same events happening in other locations
			  and tag them as the same type of event?
			- What types of clustering and automated learning can we achieve on power events? What metrics do we use to perform the clustering?
			- How do we evaluate the results?

	- http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.188.6036&rep=rep1&type=pdf
		- This aurthor would call what we're doing geocentric crowdsourcing (might be useful for further searches)

Privacy
	- Privacy-friendly Aggregation for the Smart-grid
	- http://www.msr-waypoint.com/pubs/146092/main.pdf
	- Authors argue that privacy is an issue because smart meters don't have much computational horsepower
		- They state that because of this, the power meters send most of the data elsewhere for processing
		- If we perform most of the processing on board, how does this affect privacy issues, if at all?
	- "NIST has identiffed privacy as one of the main concerns in a smart grid implementation, and proposes using the 'privacy by design' approach [3] to alleviate them"
	- What kind of identifiable information exists in PQ data? This may make an interesting research question.
	- Do any special considerations need to be taken in regards to privacy if the device is reporting back every (minute, 15 minutes, etc) and is generally not turned off
	- The rest of the paper discusses a secure protocol and means of encryption and key exchange
		- Does our protocol meet any of these characteristics?
