\section{Temporal patterns and indexing} \label{tpatterns}
In previous sections of this chapter we have shown the PAA and SAX algorithms for conversion of real value time series into symbolic representation. Later we introduced temporal data models, concepts and operators. All these was a necessary background in order to continue with review of approaches for unsupervised pattern mining from symbolic temporal data. In this section we will review sequential pattern mining algorithms from time points data along with mining algorithms for time interval data. We will base the review on the univariate data extending it to the multivariate.

Before discussing algorithms we need to define patterns of interest we are looking for. For many data mining areas such as such as medicine, motion-capture, robotics, video surveillance, meteorology and others detection of \textit{repeated} or \textit{approximately repeated} patterns plays essential role. These repeated patterns are named as \textit{motifs}. In the same time in the mentioned and other areas detection of the \textit{unusual} (\textit{novelty}) patterns has the same or even greater value, for example it is important to detect unusual semi-repeated pattern in the ECG data or unusual activity patterns in video surveillance in order to recognize suspicious activity. These patterns, which appear uniquely or with some frequency highly different from expected, named as \textit{surprise patterns} \cite{citeulike:3025877}.


\subsection{Time points patterns}
According to M\"orchen, the most commonly searched pattern within univariate symbolic time series is order. This search for particular order of symbols within subsequence is not necesserely requires symbols to be consecutive, usually gaps and substitution allowed. The very similar problem of string matching is one of the central in the computation biology \cite{citeulike:465665} and many algorithms are very similar. The suffix tree algorithm is a standard approach for pattern discovery from the string time-series according to Palopoli et al \cite{citeulike:5003338}. Authors discussing algorithms of automatic discovery of frequent structured patterns (\textit{motifs}) in ``exact'' or ``approximate'' forms. 

As an opposite to motif finding problem, a \textit{surprise pattern} problem explored too. In many fields: biology, physics, astronomy and statistics various algorithms proposed. Keogh et al in \cite{citeulike:3025877} discuss methods of finding a surprise patterns from the temporal data and propose their ``TARZAN'' algorithm which is reporting surprising patterns occurring with substantially different frequency from that expected by chance.
