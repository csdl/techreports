\chapter{Methods}
This chapter discusses relevant to the research methods and structured as follows: the Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (\ref{paa}) and Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (\ref{sax}) sections explain the aproach taken for conversion of Hackystat telemetry streams into \textit{symbolic sequences}.  
The Temporal Concepts section (\ref{tconcepts}) introduces data models of \textit{time-points} and \textit{time-intervals} on the symbolic sequences along with \textit{temporal concepts} and applicable \textit{temporal operators}. The last section, Temporal patterns  and indexing (\ref{tpatterns}) defines \textit{temporal patterns}, introduces \textit{motif} and \textit{surprise} patterns along with discussing relevant pattern search algorithms and data structures used for patterns indexing.
