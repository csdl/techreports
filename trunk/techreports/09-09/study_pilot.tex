\section{Pilot study}\label{pilot.evaluation}
In order to demonstrate the ability of Trajectory to perform telemetry indexing and temporal recurrent patterns extraction, I have conducted two experiments which provide insights in the use of the motif frequencies and software process event taxonomies.

While it seems to be meaningful to find correlation between \textit{UnitTest\_Failure} and \textit{CodeIssue} streams unit test, this grouping happened due to the similarity of behavior pattern - short, high amplitude bursts; but note, there is no correlation of features in time .}

\subsection{Clustering of the Hackystat Telemetry streams}
The main purpose of the this study was to evaluate the ability of PAA and SAX approximations and indexing to capture a temporal specificity of telemetry streams through the discovery of recurrent temporal patterns. Knowing about the frequently misleading results of a time-series clustering \cite{citeulike:227029}, I did not expect to capture much interesting facts, nevertheless the results were encouraging.

The data used in this study was collected from student users of Hackystat during Spring, 2009. This dataset represents Hackystat metrics collected during sixty days of a classroom project by eight students. The following clustering experiments were conducted using the distance between vectors of motif frequencies extracted by indexing of telemetry streams:

Developers \#2 and \#7 were consistent (no bursts observed) in both, coding and measuring effort during whole time interval, while all others can be characterized with bursty, inconsistent effort.}
   \label{fig:cluster_developers}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Clustering of software process related telemetry streams collected from individual developers. I was able to group developers with similar behavioral patterns within clusters, which indicates the feasibility of the classification approach. Figure \ref{fig:cluster_developers} depicts results of this analysis.
	\item Clustering of software product-related telemetry streams by using motif frequencies. I was able to group telemetry streams, but while these groups look intuitively meaningful, the close examination of the stream features suggests that this grouping happened due to the similar temporal behavior on the short stretches. This result, while proving the correctness of approach, indicates it's limitation, pointing that instead of using just motif frequencies, some temporal ordering should be taken into account. Figure \ref{fig:cluster_streams} displays results of this analysis.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sequential patterns search}
The second pilot study, focusing on discovery of sequential patterns, was conducted using real data from my own concurrent development of two software projects. While working on the Trajectory framework, I made decision to split the code into two parts: an algorithm implementation library that I named JMotif, and user-interface part called TrajectoryBrowser. While this decision simplified development, it introduced a dependency of TrajectoryBrowser on the JMotif API. As a result of iterative and incremental pattern in my development, I changed the JMotif public API three times, which consequently involved extensive refactoring in the ProjectBrowser code. This dependency can be clearly seen from observing DevTime streams at Figure \ref{fig:sequential_growth} panel $a$.

   \includegraphics[height=80mm]{sequential_growth.eps}
   \caption{The illustration of finding of sequential $growth \; pattern$ in two DevTime telemetry streams. Panel $a$: The Hackystat ProjectBrowser showing telemetry streams. Panel $b$: the TrajectoryBrowser showing same telemetry streams along with identified pattern. Panel $c$: the symbolic representation of streams with highlighted pattern.}
   \label{fig:sequential_growth}
\end{figure}

In order to capture this dependency pattern in two Telemetry streams, representing the daily amount of development time spent on the TrajectoryBrowser and JMotif projects, I defined a synthetic \textit{growth pattern} as the large positive delta value between previous and current day effort. By transforming Telemetry streams with this simple rule in the symbolic form, I obtained a two dimensional symbolic time series, where letter $G$ represents a growth pattern, see Figure \ref{fig:sequential_growth} panel $c$. I defined a formal rule for \textit{sequential growth} pattern as the pattern like $G_{JMotif}\; \rightarrow \; G_{TrajectoryBrowser}$ where distance between these $G$s is less than three days. By application of this rule I identified a pattern which exactly corresponds to my experience. 

While this experiment was designed with a purpose and does not provide any value in the dependencies discovery, the ``sequential growth'' pattern and past effort information can be used in the estimation of effort needed for requested software changes.
