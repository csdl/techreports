\section{Introduction}
For my dissertation research, I propose to implement and evaluate a novel approach for discovering recurrent patterns of software development behaviors based upon automatically collected, low-level product and process data. There is a long tradition in software engineering of proposing specific patterns of software behaviors in order to produce high quality software. For example, the Waterfall Model process proposes a sequential pattern in which developers first create a Requirements document, then create a Design, then create an Implementation, and finally develop Tests. The Test Driven Development process proposes an iterative pattern in which the developer must first write a test case, then write the code to implement that test case, then refactor the system for maximum clarity and minimal code duplication.

One problem with the traditional top-down approach to process development is that it requires the developer or manager to notice a recurrent pattern of behavior in the first place \cite{citeulike:5043104}. In my research, I will apply knowledge discovery and data mining techniques to the domain of software engineering in order to evaluate their ability to automatically notice interesting recurrent patterns of behavior. As a simple example, consider a development team in which committing code to a repository triggers a build of the system. Sometimes the build passes, and sometimes the build fails. To improve the productivity of the team, it would be useful to be aware of any recurrent behaviors of the developers. 

My system might generate one recurrent pattern consisting of a) implementing code b) running unit tests, c) committing code and d) a passed build: $i \rightarrow u \rightarrow c \rightarrow s $, and another recurrent pattern consisting of a) implementing code, b) committing code, and c) a failed build: $i \rightarrow c \rightarrow f $. The automated generation of these recurrent patterns can provide actionable knowledge to developers; in this case, the insight that running test cases prior to committing code reduces the frequency of build failures.

The proposed contributions of my research will include: a) the implementation of a system aiding in discovery of novel software process knowledge (shown at the Figure \ref{fig:system_overview}); b) my experimental evaluation of the system which will provide insight into its strengths and weaknesses, and c) the possible discovery of useful new software process patterns.

\section{Approach and Methods}
Many temporal knowledge discovery and data mining methods developed in the last decade can be applied to the software process domain. In my research to date, I have implemented a Symbolic Aggregate approXimation algorithm \cite{citeulike:2821475} which transforms Hackystat telemetry streams (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}, panels $a$, $b$, $c$) into symbolic representations (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}, panels $d$, $f$, $h$). Symbolic telemetry streams are indexed and the index data are stored in a relational database. This approach addresses the data requirements of implemented KDD and clustering algorithms with SQL queries: for example, it's very easy to get the temporal motifs frequency vector for each of the telemetry streams or find the set of most frequent motifs across the subset of streams. Currently, I am working on the extension of the temporal indexes with fine-grained singular software development events data and with an interval series option (Figure \ref{fig:fig2}, panels $e$ and $g$). Using this rich index data, I am planning to experiment with Interagon Query Language (IQL) for symbolic temporal data \cite{citeulike:5043086}, AprioriAll \cite{citeulike:775528} and Pattern-Growth algorithms \cite{citeulike:5043097} as well as with Episodes \cite{citeulike:5043099} and Partial Order patterns \cite{citeulike:5043101}. For the time-interval data, I will investigate the applicability of Allen's interval algebra \cite{citeulike:191348} and its derivatives (UTG \cite{citeulike:5043086} and TSKR \cite{citeulike:3978076}) for the software process domain. 

\section{Related work}
To the best of my knowledge, the approach I am taking in my research has never been attempted. Current and prior research efforts in software process modeling are based on top-down and descriptive process modeling \cite{citeulike:5043670}, though recently, benefits of the mining of software repositories and archived communications for non-process purposes have been recognized \cite{citeulike:5043676}. The most relevant approach to my research is called \textit{incremental workflow mining} and was developed by Rubin et al. \cite{citeulike:1885717}. Authors built their system using a business process mining framework ProM by van Dongen et al. \cite{citeulike:5043673} which synthesizes a Petri Net corresponding to the process observed from a transition system discovered through the SCM mining. Jensen \& Scacchi in \cite{citeulike:5043664} proposed a similar reference model for OSS software processes discovery by extending CVS mining with domain-specific knowledge discovered from developer communications and some additional artifacts such as tool and resource usage.

\section{Current state of the research}
The methods I have investigated in my research so far include a wide variety of time-series approximations, similarity search and pattern matching. While I started by indexing temporal data with spectral decomposition methods, I have now switched to Dynamic Time Warping and built a time-series similarity search framework based on DTW. Currently I am working with SAX based approximation. During this time I have implemented several algorithms in Java and contributed this code to the community by creating the open-source JMotif library for time-series indexing. The latest version of Trajectory software uses this library and is capable of indexing telemetry streams with successive visualization of any strong sequential patterns (Figure \ref{fig:fig3} panel $b$). By performing indexing and using the discovered temporal motif frequencies, I have been able to carry out a number of classification analyses. The data I was working with was collected in a software engineering class taught at UH. I was able to successfully classify developers by similar activity patterns as shown at Figure \ref{fig:fig3} panel $c$. Classification of the individual Hackystat telemetry streams, Figure \ref{fig:fig3} panel $d$, shows some very intuitive correlations: for example the temporal behavior of the CodeIssue stream is closely followed with UnitTest failure count, and the DevTime stream is followed by the TotalBuild count.

As mentioned before, currently I am working on the capturing of low-level activity and patterns from individual telemetry streams aiming creation of a multivariate event streams for the sequential and episodic patterns discovery.

\section{Experimental validation}
I am planning a number of experiments to evaluate the ability of my system to discover useful recurrent patterns of software development. These experiments will be divided into two phases. Phase one experiments evaluate the ability of my approach for a discovery of potential recurrent patterns through the mining of two sources: 1) existing Hackystat datasets from Fall'08 and Spring'09 Software engineering classes taught at UH and 2) publicly available software process data sets \cite{Sayyad-Shirabad+Menzies:2005}. 
	
The pool of candidate patterns will be curated and validated in phase two. In this phase of my research, I am planning to implement a continuous telemetry indexing system and use it for a graduate level Software engineering class during Fall'09 semester: if some of the existing candidate patterns will be found in the telemetry streams collected, I will communicate with students in order to investigate the pattern generative process background. 

I will publish the results of my approach and its evaluation in conferences and journals associated with the software process community.

\section{Estimated timeline}
By the beginning of the Fall'09 semester, I plan to finish the implementation of a time-interval and a fine-grain telemetry event indexers and design an extended database schema capable of storing these indexes. This new indexing approach will allow me to keep a symbolic representation of telemetry streams data along with a symbolic sequences of recognized software development events. Immediately after that, I will proceed with the implementation of fundamental algorithms for associated and sequential patterns mining in order to perform all Phase one experiments before the data collection from the Fall'09 Software engineering class begins.

During the period of data collection (late Fall'09) I will be working with those students who will demonstrate a relevant recurrent behavior in the software process for clarification of observed phenomena and will continue to work on the Trajectory Expert View user interface implementation. By the end of the Spring'10 semester I am planning to finish all of my experiments and the software system implementation, and will move on to a peer-reviewed publication and the dissertation thesis defense.
