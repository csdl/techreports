    abstract = {Time series motifs are repeated segments in a long time series that, if exist, carry precise information about the underlying source of the time series. Motif discovery in time series data has received significant attention in the data mining community since its inception, principally because, motif discovery is meaningful and more likely to succeed when the data is large. Algorithms for motif discovery generally deal with three aspects  the definition of the motifs, domain based preprocessing, and finally, the algorithmic steps. Typical definitions of motifs signify the similarity or the support of the motifs. Domains impose preprocessing requirements to meaningful motif finding such as data alignment, interpolation, and transformation. Motif discovery algorithms vary based on exact or approximate evaluation of the definition. In addition, algorithms require different representations [Symbolic Aggregate {approXimation} ({SAX}), {DFT} etc.] and similarity measures [correlation, dynamic time warping ({DTW}) distance etc.] for time series segments. In this paper, we discuss these  three facets  in detail with examples taken from the literature. We briefly describe a set of applications of time series motif in various domains and elaborate on  a certain  application in entomology to analyze insect behavior.

    abstract = {Since code revisions reflect the extent of human involvement in the software development process, revision histories reveal the interactions and interfaces between developers and {modules.We} therefore divide developers and modules into groups according to the revision histories of the open source software repository, for example, sourceforge.net. To describe the interactions in the open source development process, we use a representative model, Legitimate Peripheral Participation ({LPP}) [6], to divide developers into groups such as core and peripheral teams, based on the evolutionary process of learning {behavior.With} the conventional module relationship, we divide modules into kernel and non-kernel types (such as {UI}). In the past, groups of developers and modules have been partitioned naturally with informal criteria. In this work, however, we propose a developer-module relationship model to analyze the grouping structures between developers and modules. Our results show some process cases of relative importance on the constructed graph of project development. The graph reveals certain subtle relationships in the interactions between core and non-core team developers, and the interfaces between kernel and non-kernel modules.},

    abstract = {A programmer performing a change task to a system can benefit from accurate comments on the source code. As part of good programming practice described by Kernighan and Pike in the book The Practice of Programming, comments should "aid the understanding of a program by briefly pointing out salient details or by providing a larger-scale view of the proceedings." In this paper, we explore the widely varying uses of comments in source code. We find that programmers not only use comments for describing the actual source code, but also use comments for many other purposes, such as "talking" to colleagues through the source code using a comment "Joan, please fix this method." This kind of comments can complicate the mining of project information because such team communication is often perceived to reside in separate archives, such as emails or newsgroup postings, rather than in the source code. Nevertheless, these and other types of comments can be very useful inputs for mining project information.},

    abstract = {Temporal segmentation partitions time series data with the intent of producing more homogeneous segments. It is a technique used to preprocess data so that subsequent time series analysis on individual segments can detect trends that may not be evident when performing time series analysis on the entire dataset. This technique allows data miners to partition a large dataset without making any assumption of periodicity or any other a priori knowledge of the dataset's features. We investigate the insights that can be gained from the application of time series segmentation to software version repositories. Software version repositories from large projects contain on the order of hundreds of thousands of timestamped entries or more. It is a continuing challenge to aggregate such data so that noise is reduced and important characteristics are brought out. In this paper, we present a way to summarize developer work history in terms of the files they have modified over time by segmenting the {CVS} change data of individual Eclipse developers. We show that the files they modify tends to change significantly over time though most of them tend to work within the same directories.},

    abstract = {Prediction of software defects works well within projects as long as there is a sufficient amount of data available to train any models. However, this is rarely the case for new software projects and for many companies. So far, only a few have studies focused on transferring prediction models from one project to another. In this paper, we study cross-project defect prediction models on a large scale. For 12 real-world applications, we ran 622 cross-project predictions. Our results indicate that cross-project prediction is a serious challenge, i.e., simply using models from projects in the same domain or with the same process does not lead to accurate predictions. To help software engineers choose models wisely, we identified factors that do influence the success of cross-project predictions. We also derived decision trees that can provide early estimates for precision, recall, and accuracy before a prediction is attempted.},

The focus is directed at understanding the requirements for open software development efforts, and how the development of these requirements differs from those traditional to software engineering and requirements engineering. Four open software development communities are described, examined and compared to help discover what these differences may be. Eight kinds of software informalisms are found to play a critical role in the elicitation, analysis, specification, validation and management of requirements for developing open software systems. Subsequently, understanding the roles these software informalisms take in a new formulation of the requirements development process for open source software is the focus of the study. This focus enables the consideration of a reformulation of the requirements engineering process and its associated artefacts, or (in)formalisms, to better account for the requirements for developing open source software systems},

We conducted a survey with Microsoft engineers on inter-team coordination and found that the most impactful problems concerned finding and keeping track of other engineers. Since engineers are connected by their shared work, a tool that discovers connections in their work-related repositories can help. Here we describe the Codebook framework for mining software repositories. It is flexible enough to address all of the problems identified by our survey with a single data structure (graph of people and artifacts) and a single algorithm (regular language reachability). Codebook handles a larger variety of problems than prior work, analyzes more kinds of work artifacts, and can be customized by and for end-users.

A heuristic-based approach that uses sequential-pattern mining is applied to the commits in software repositories for uncovering highly frequent co-changing sets of artifacts (e.g., source code and documentation). If different types of files are committed together with high frequency then there is a high probability that they have a traceability link between them. The approach is evaluated on a number of versions of the open source system {KDE}. As a validation step, the discovered links are used to predict similar changes in the newer versions of the same system. The results show highly precision predictions of certain types of traceability links.},

    abstract = {Software repositories have been getting a lot of attention from researchers in recent years. In order to analyze software repositories, it is necessary to first extract raw data from the version control and problem tracking systems. This poses two challenges: (1) extraction requires a non-trivial effort, and (2) the results depend on the heuristics used during extraction. These challenges burden researchers that are new to the community and make it difficult to benchmark software repository mining since it is almost impossible to reproduce experiments done by another team. In this paper we present the {TA}-{RE} corpus. {TA}-{RE} collects extracted data from software repositories in order to build a collection of projects that will simplify extraction process. Additionally the collection can be used for benchmarking. As the first step we propose an exchange language capable of making sharing and reusing data as simple as possible.},

We present a simple methodology for tool evaluation that correlates tool usage statistics with estimates of developer e ort, as derived from a project's change history (version control system). Our work complements controlled experiments on software tools, which usually take place outside the industrial setting, and tool assessment studies that predict the impact of software tools before deployment. Our analysis is inexpensive, non-intrusive and can be appliedtoanentire software project in its actual setting. Akey part of our analysis is how tocontrol confounding variables such asdeveloper work-style and experience in order accurately to quantify the impact of a tool on developer e ort. We demonstrate our method in a case study of a software tool called {VE}, a version-sensitive editor used in Bell Labs. {VE} aids software developers in coping with the rampant use of preprocessor directives (such as \#if/\#endif) in C source les.

    abstract = {Large scale software products must constantly change in order to
adapt to a changing environment. Studies of historic data from legacy
software systems have identified three specific causes of this change:
adding new features; correcting faults; and restructuring code to
accommodate future changes. Our hypothesis is that a textual description
field of a change is essential to understanding why that change was
performed. Also, we expect that difficulty, size, and interval would
vary strongly across different types of changes. To test these
hypotheses we have designed a program which automatically classifies
maintenance activity based on a textual description of changes.
Developer surveys showed that the automatic classification was in
agreement with developer opinions. Tests of the classifier on a
different product found that size and interval for different types of
changes did not vary across two products. We have found strong
relationships between the type and size of a change and the time
required to carry it out. We also discovered a relatively large amount
of perfective changes in the system we examined. From this study we have
arrived at several suggestions on how to make version control data
useful in diagnosing the state of a software project, without
significantly increasing the overhead for the developer using the change
management system},

    abstract = {Online service systems have been increasingly popular and important nowadays, with an increasing demand on the availability of services provided by these systems, while significant efforts have been made to strive for keeping services up continuously. Therefore, reducing the {MTTR} (Mean Time to Restore) of a service remains the most important step to assure the user-perceived availability of the service. To reduce the {MTTR}, a common practice is to restore the service by identifying and applying an appropriate healing action (i.e., a temporary workaround action such as rebooting a {SQL} machine). However, manually identifying an appropriate healing action for a given new issue (such as service down) is typically time consuming and error prone. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present an automated mining-based approach for suggesting an appropriate healing action for a given new issue. Our approach generates signatures of an issue from its corresponding transaction logs and then retrieves historical issues from a historical issue repository. Finally, our approach suggests an appropriate healing action by adapting healing actions for the retrieved historical issues. We have implemented a healing suggestion system for our approach and applied it to a real-world product online service that serves millions of online customers globally. The studies on 77 incidents (severe issues) over 3 months showed that our approach can effectively provide appropriate healing actions to reduce the {MTTR} of the service.},

    abstract = {A great deal of attention has lately been given to addressing software bugs such as errors in operating system drivers or security bugs. However, there are many other lesser known errors specific to individual applications or {APIs} and these violations of application-specific coding rules are responsible for a multitude of errors. In this paper we propose {DynaMine}, a tool that analyzes source code check-ins to find highly correlated method calls as well as common bug fixes in order to automatically discover application-specific coding patterns. Potential patterns discovered through mining are passed to a dynamic analysis tool for validation; finally, the results of dynamic analysis are presented to the {user.The} combination of revision history mining and dynamic analysis techniques leveraged in {DynaMine} proves effective for both discovering new application-specific patterns and for finding errors when applied to very large applications with many man-years of development and debugging effort behind them. We have analyzed Eclipse and {jEdit}, two widely-used, mature, highly extensible applications consisting of more than 3,600,000 lines of code combined. By mining revision histories, we have discovered 56 previously unknown, highly application-specific patterns. Out of these, 21 were dynamically confirmed as very likely valid patterns and a total of 263 pattern violations were found.},

    abstract = {Software measurement, like measurement in any other discipline,
must adhere to the science of measurement if it is to gain widespread
acceptance and validity. The observation of some very simple, but
fundamental, principles of measurement can have an extremely beneficial
effect on the subject. Measurement theory is used to highlight both
weaknesses and strengths of software metrics work, including work on
metrics validation. We identify a problem with the well-known Weyuker
properties ({E.J}. Weyuker, 1988), but also show that a criticism of these
properties by {J.C}. Cherniavsky and {C.H}. Smith (1991) is invalid. We show
that the search for general software complexity measures is doomed to
failure. However, the theory does help us to define and validate
measures of specific complexity attributes. Above all, we are able to
view software measurement in a very wide perspective, rationalising and
relating its many diverse activities},

    abstract = {Source code version repositories provide a treasure of information encompassing the changes introduced
in the system throughout its evolution. These repositories are typically managed by tools such as {CVS}. However, these
tools identify and express changes in terms of physical attributes i.e., file and line numbers. Recently, to help
support the mining of software repositories ({MSR}), researchers have proposed methods to derive and express changes
from source code repositories in a more source-code "aware" manner (i.e., syntax and semantic). Here, we discuss these
{MSR} techniques in light of what changes are identified, how they are expressed, the adopted methodology, evaluation,
and results. This work forms the basis for a taxonomic description of {MSR} approaches.},

    abstract = {{F/OSS} research faces a new and unusual situation: the traditional difficulties of gathering enough empirical data have been replaced by issues of dealing with enormous amounts of freely available data from many disparate sources (forums, code, bug reports, etc.) At present no means exist for assembling these data under common access points and frameworks for comparative, longitudinal, and collaborative research. Gathering and maintaining large {F/OSS} data collections reliably and making them usable present several research challenges. For example, current projects usually rely on \^{a}¬Ä¬úweb scraping \^{a}¬Ä¬ù or on direct access to raw data from groups that generate it, and both of these methods require unique effort for each new corpus, or even for updating existing corpora. In this paper we identify several common needs and critical factors in {F/OSS} empirical research, and suggest orientations and recommendations for the design of a shared research infrastructure. 1.},

@book{citeulike:12929216,
    abstract = {From the {Publisher:This} new work from Watts Humphrey, author of the influential book, Managing the Software Process, broadens his orderly view of software process management, and lays the foundation for a disciplined approach to software engineering. In his earlier book, the author developed concrete methods for managing software development and maintenance. These methods, now commonly practiced in industry, provide programmers and managers with specific steps they can take to evaluate and improve their software capabilities. In this new book, Humphrey scales those methods down to a personal level, helping software engineers develop the skills and habits needed to plan, track, and analyze large, complex projects. Humphrey and others have used material from this book to train professionals and students around the world in a projects-oriented software engineering course. First establishing the need for discipline in software engineering, and the benefits to practitioners of learning how to 
manage their personal software process, Humphrey then develops a model that they can use to monitor, test, and improve their work. Examples drawn from industry enhance the practical focus of the book, while project exercises give readers the opportunity to practice software process management as they learn it. Features: presents concepts and methods for a disciplined software engineering process; scales down industrial practices for planning, tracking, analysis, and defect management to fit the needs of small-scale program development; and shows how small project disciplines provide a solid base for larger projects.},

                Mid-infrared spectroscopy was used to discriminate between pure beef and beef containing 20\% w/w of a
range of potential adulterants (heart, tripe, kidney, and liver). Spectra were acquired from raw samples and from
samples cooked using two different cooking regimes. Chemometric methods (principal component analysis, partial least
squares regression, and linear discriminant analysis) applied to the spectra showed that discrimination between the pure
and adulterated sample types was possible, irrespective of cooking regime. The cross-validated classification success
rate obtained was approximately 97\%. Discrimination between all five sample types (pure beef and beef containing one of
each of the four adulterants) at each level of cook was also possible, but became more difficult as the cooking level
increased.

    abstract = {Abstract. In this paper, we introduce and analyze a new, dynamic generative user model to explain the behavior of file size distributions. Our Recursive Forest File model combines multiplicative models that generate lognormal distributions with recent work on random graph models for the web. Unlike similar previous work, our Recursive Forest File model allows new files to be created and old files to be deleted over time, and our analysis covers problematic issues such as correlation among file sizes. Moreover, our model allows natural variations where files that are copied or modified are more likely to be copied or modified subsequently. Previous empirical work suggests that file sizes tend to have a lognormal body but a Pareto tail. The Recursive Forest File model explains this behavior, yielding a double Pareto distribution, which has a Pareto tail but close to a lognormal body. We believe the Recursive Forest model may be useful for describing other power law phenomena in computer systems 
as well as other fields. 1.},

    abstract = {Most studies of software evolution have been performed on systems developed within a single company using traditional management techniques. With the widespread availability of several large software systems that have been developed using an \&ldquo;open source\&rdquo; development approach, we now have a chance to examine these systems in detail, and see if their evolutionary narratives are significantly different from commercially developed systems. The paper summarizes our preliminary investigations into the evolution of the best known open source system: the Linux operating system kernel. Because Linux is large (over two million lines of code in the most recent version) and because its development model is not as tightly planned and managed as most industrial software processes, we had expected to find that Linux was growing more slowly as it got bigger and more complex. Instead, we have found that Linux has been growing at a super-linear rate for several years. The authors explore the 
evolution of the Linux kernel both at the system level and within the major subsystems, and they discuss why they think Linux continues to exhibit such strong growth},

    abstract = {With the approach of the new millennium, a primary focus in software engineering involves issues relating to upgrading, migrating, and evolving existing software systems. In this environment, the role of careful empirical studies as the basis for improving software maintenance processes, methods, and tools is highlighted. One of the most important processes that merits empirical evaluation is software evolution. Software evolution refers to the dynamic behaviour of software systems as they are maintained and enhanced over their lifetimes. Software evolution is particularly important as systems in organizations become longer-lived. However, evolution is challenging to study due to the longitudinal nature of the phenomenon in addition to the usual difficulties in collecting empirical data. We describe a set of methods and techniques that we have developed and adapted to empirically study software evolution. Our longitudinal empirical study involves collecting, coding, and analyzing more than 
25000 change events to 23 commercial software systems over a 20-year period. Using data from two of the systems, we illustrate the efficacy of flexible phase mapping and gamma sequence analytic methods, originally developed in social psychology to examine group problem solving processes. We have adapted these techniques in the context of our study to identify and understand the phases through which a software system travels as it evolves over time. We contrast this approach with time series analysis. Our work demonstrates the advantages of applying methods and techniques from other domains to software engineering and illustrates how, despite difficulties, software evolution can be empirically studied},

    abstract = {The problem of efficiently locating previously known patterns in a time series database (i.e., query by content) has received much attention and may now largely be regarded as a solved problem. However, from a knowledge discovery viewpoint, a more interesting problem is the enumeration of previously unknown, frequently occurring patterns. We call such patterns "motifs", because of their close analogy to their discrete counterparts in computation biology. An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful as a tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition it could be used as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks, including the discovery of association rules, clustering and classification. In this paper we carefully motivate, then introduce, a nontrivial definition of time series motifs. We propose an efficient algorithm to discover them, and we demonstrate the utility and efficiency of our approach on several real world datasets.},

    abstract = {This paper describes a sound methodology developed at Praxis High Integrity Systems for detecting and exterminating bugs during all stages of a software project. To develop software, the London-based software house uses mathematically based techniques, known as formal methods, which require that programmers begin their work not by writing code but rather by stringing together special symbols that represent the program's logic. Like a mathematical theorem, these symbol strings can be checked to verify that they form logically correct statements. Once the programmer has checked that the program doesn't have logical flaws, it's a relatively simple matter to convert those symbols into programming code. With an average of less than one error in every 10,000 lines of delivered code, Praxis claims a bug rate that is at least 50 times better than the industry standard.},

These, in turn, are affected by the basic views and attitudes of the individual engineers. The objective of this paper is to establish if these views and attitudes can be linked to the personalities of software engineers. We summarize the literature on personality and software engineering and then describe an empirical study on 47 professional engineers in ten different Swedish software development companies. The study evaluated the personalities of these engineers via the {IPIP} 50-item five-factor personality test and prompted them on their attitudes towards and basic views on their professional activities. We present extensive statistical analyses of their responses to show that there are multiple, significant associations between personality factors and software engineering attitudes. The tested individuals are 
more homogeneous in personality than a larger sample of individuals from the general population. Taken together, the methodology and personality test we propose and the associated statistical analyses can help find and quantify relations between complex factors in software engineering projects in both research and practice.},

    abstract = {People are a critical software development issue, and the human dimension can be even more important than the technical. An important part of human resources management is assigning people to development roles. This process isn't just crucial for generating productive teams; it can also help software organizations develop systematic long-term competence. Despite the importance of identifying the right people for roles, little is known about doing this properly. Integrating managerial experience with a procedure for identifying the person best suited for each role can help improve human resources management and long-term career development. We've defined a human capability-based procedure to supplement managerial activities for supporting personnel development and human resources management. Along with occupational psychologists and software managers, we've applied our procedure in small and medium-sized enterprises ({SMEs}).},

                The newly inaugurated Research Resource for Complex Physiologic Signals, which was created under the
auspices of the National Center for Research Resources of the National Institutes of Health, is intended to stimulate
current research and new investigations in the study of cardiovascular and other complex biomedical signals. The
resource has 3 interdependent components. {PhysioBank} is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital
recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes
databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from
patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias,
congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. {PhysioToolkit} is a library of open-source
software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using
both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display
and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the
quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. {PhysioNet} is
an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for
analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new
algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to {PhysioBank} data and {PhysioToolkit} software via the
World Wide Web (http://www.physionet. org), {PhysioNet} offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist
users with varying levels of expertise.

@article{citeulike:1172599,
    abstract = {Unlabeled document collections are becoming increasingly common and available\&semi; mining such data
sets represents a major contemporary challenge. Using words as features, text documents are often represented as
high-dimensional and sparse vectors‚Äìa few thousand dimensions and a sparsity of 95 to 99\% is typical. In this paper, we
study a certain spherical k-means algorithm for clustering such document vectors. The algorithm outputs k disjoint
clusters each with a concept vector that is the centroid of the cluster normalized to have unit Euclidean norm. As our
first contribution, we empirically demonstrate that, owing to the high-dimensionality and sparsity of the text data, the
clusters produced by the algorithm have a certain  ‚Äù fractal-like‚Äù and  ‚Äù self-similar‚Äù behavior. As our second
contribution, we introduce concept decompositions to approximate the matrix of document vectors\&semi; these
decompositions are obtained by taking the least-squares approximation onto the linear subspace spanned by all the
concept vectors. We empirically establish that the approximation errors of the concept decompositions are close to the
best possible, namely, to truncated singular value decompositions. As our third contribution, we show that the concept
vectors are localized in the word space, are sparse, and tend towards orthonormality. In contrast, the singular vectors
are global in the word space and are dense. Nonetheless, we observe the surprising fact that the linear subspaces
spanned by the concept vectors and the leading singular vectors are quite close in the sense of small principal angles
between them. In conclusion, the concept vectors produced by the spherical k-means algorithm constitute a powerful
sparse and localized  ‚Äù basis‚Äù for text data sets.},

operates within the confines of a limited memory buffer. Empirical results demonstrate that the scalable scheme

data mining, including improving the quality of clustering, data cleaning, summarization, and anomaly detection. As we
will show, discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter
(the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We
evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of discords with
objective experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, medicine, surveillance, and industry,

different datasets from diverse domains.},

series, presents a specific machine learning challenge as the ordering of variables is often crucial in finding the best
discriminating features. One of the most promising recent approaches is to find shapelets within a data set. A shapelet
is a time series subsequence that is identified as being representative of class membership. The original research in
this field embedded the procedure of finding shapelets within a decision tree. We propose disconnecting the process of
finding shapelets from the classification algorithm by proposing a shapelet transformation. We describe a means of
extracting the k best shapelets from a data set in a single pass, and then use these shapelets to transform data by
calculating the distances from a series to each shapelet. We demonstrate that transformation into this new data space
can improve classification accuracy, whilst retaining the explanatory power provided by shapelets.},

algorithms used to index time series utilize the Euclidean distance or some variation thereof. However is has been
forcefully shown that the Euclidean distance is a very brittle distance measure. Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) is a much
more robust distance measure for time series, allowing similar shapes to match even if they are out of phase in the time
axis. Because of this flexibility, {DTW} is widely used in science, medicine, industry and finance. Unfortunately
however, {DTW} does not obey the triangular inequality, and thus has resisted attempts at exact indexing. Instead, many
researchers have introduced approximate indexing techniques, or abandoned the idea of indexing and concentrated on
speeding up sequential search. In this work we introduce a novel technique for the exact indexing of {DTW}. We prove
that our method guarantees no false dismissals and we demonstrate its vast superiority over all competing approaches in
the largest and most comprehensive set of time series indexing experiments ever undertaken.},

retrieval, health informatics, finance, and abnormal detection. Different from the classification task on feature
vectors, sequences do not have explicit features. Even with sophisticated feature selection techniques, the
dimensionality of potential features may still be very high and the sequential nature of features is difficult to
capture. This makes sequence classification a more challenging task than classification on feature vectors. In this
paper, we present a brief review of the existing work on sequence classification. We summarize the sequence
classification in terms of methodologies and application domains. We also provide a review on several extensions of the
sequence classification problem, such as early classification on sequences and semi-supervised learning on sequences.},

    abstract = {The previous decade has brought a remarkable increase of the interest in applications that deal with
querying and mining of time series data. Many of the research efforts in this context have focused on introducing new
representation methods for dimensionality reduction or novel similarity measures for the underlying data. In the vast
majority of cases, each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the
occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the
comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods
over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive
experimental study re-implementing eight different time series representations and nine similarity measures and their
variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In
this article, we give an overview of these different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings
regarding their effectiveness. In addition to providing a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, our
experiments also indicate that, in some cases, certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.},

repeated subsequences in a longer time series. In an earlier work, we formalized the idea of approximately repeated
subsequences by introducing the notion of time series motifs. Two limitations of this work were the poor scalability of
the motif discovery algorithm, and the inability to discover motifs in the presence of {noise.Here} we address these
limitations by introducing a novel algorithm inspired by recent advances in the problem of pattern discovery in
biosequences. Our algorithm is probabilistic in nature, but as we show empirically and theoretically, it can find time
series motifs with very high probability even in the presence of noise or "don't care" symbols. Not only is the
algorithm fast, but it is an anytime algorithm, producing likely candidate motifs almost immediately, and gradually
improving the quality of results over time.},

    abstract = {Time series clustering has become an increasingly important research topic over the past decade. Most
existing methods for time series clustering rely on distances calculated from the entire raw data using the Euclidean
distance or Dynamic Time Warping distance as the distance measure. However, the presence of significant noise, dropouts,
or extraneous data can greatly limit the accuracy of clustering in this domain. Moreover, for most real world problems,
we cannot expect objects from the same class to be equal in length. As a consequence, most work on time series
clustering only considers the clustering of individual time series "behaviors," e.g., individual heart beats or
individual gait cycles, and contrives the time series in some way to make them all equal in length. However, contriving
the data in such a way is often a harder problem than the clustering itself. In this work, we show that by using only
some local patterns and deliberately ignoring the rest of the data, we can mitigate the above problems and cluster time
series of different lengths, i.e., cluster one heartbeat with multiple heartbeats. To achieve this we exploit and extend
a recently introduced concept in time series data mining called shapelets. Unlike existing work, our work demonstrates
for the first time the unintuitive fact that shapelets can be learned from unlabeled time series. We show, with
extensive empirical evaluation in diverse domains, that our method is more accurate than existing methods. Moreover, in
addition to accurate clustering results, we show that our work also has the potential to give insights into the domains
to which it is applied.},

@article{citeulike:7344347,
    abstract = {Classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade. While dozens of
techniques have been introduced, recent empirical evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighbor
algorithm is very difficult to beat for most time series problems, especially for large-scale datasets. While this may
be considered good news, given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor algorithm, there are some negative
consequences of this. First, the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing and searching the entire dataset, resulting
in a high time and space complexity that limits its applicability, especially on resource-limited sensors. Second,
beyond mere classification accuracy, we often wish to gain some insight into the data and to make the classification
result more explainable, which global characteristics of the nearest neighbor cannot provide. In this work we introduce
a new time series primitive, time series shapelets, which addresses these limitations. Informally, shapelets are time
series subsequences which are in some sense maximally representative of a class. We can use the distance to the
shapelet, rather than the distance to the nearest neighbor to classify objects. As we shall show with extensive
empirical evaluations in diverse domains, classification algorithms based on the time series shapelet primitives can be
interpretable, more accurate, and significantly faster than state-of-the-art classifiers.},

patterns in time-series databases, is an interesting data mining
problem. Previous studies on periodicity search mainly consider finding
full periodic patterns, where every point in time contributes (precisely
or approximately) to the periodicity. However, partial periodicity is
very common in practice since it is more likely that only some of the
time episodes may exhibit periodic patterns. We present several
algorithms for efficient mining of partial periodic patterns, by
exploring some interesting properties related to partial periodicity
such as the Apriori property and the max-subpattern hit set property,
and by shared mining of multiple periods. The max-subpattern hit set
property is a vital new property which allows us to derive the counts of
all frequent patterns from a relatively small subset of patterns
existing in the time series. We show that mining partial periodicity
needs only two scans over the time series database, even for mining
multiple periods. The performance study shows our proposed methods are
very efficient in mining long periodic patterns},

assess the evolution of a software system, the information they contain is limited in several ways. Versioning systems
such as {CVS} or {SubVersion} store only snapshots of text files, leading to a loss of information: The exact sequence
of changes between two versions is hard to recover. In this paper we present an alternative information repository which
stores incremental changes to the system under study, retrieved from the {IDE} used to build the software. We then use
this change-based model of system evolution to assess when refactorings happen in two case studies, and compare our
findings with refactoring detection approaches on classical versioning system repositories.},

history log and snapshots of the system. Results of analyses derived from these two sources are biased by the frequency
with which developers commit their changes. We argue that the usage of mainstream {SCM} systems influences the way that
developers work. For example, since it is tedious to resolve conflicts due to parallel commits, developers tend to
minimize conflicts by not contemporarily modifying the same file. This however defeats one of the purposes of such
systems. We mine repositories created by our Syde tool, which records every change by every developer in multi-developer
projects. This new source of information can augment the accuracy of analyses and breaks new ground in terms of how such
information can assist developers. In this paper we illustrate how the information we mine can help to provide a refined
notion of code ownership. As a case study, we analyze the developers' activities of the development of a commercial

worthwhile to reflect on the best practices that our community has developed over the past decade of research. We
identify these best practices by surveying past {MSR} conferences and workshops. To that end, we review all 117 full
papers published in the {MSR} proceedings between 2004 and 2012. We extract 268 comments from these papers, and
categorize them using a grounded theory methodology. From this evaluation, four high-level themes were identified: data
acquisition and preparation, synthesis, analysis, and sharing/replication. Within each theme we identify several common
recommendations, and also examine how these recommendations have evolved over the past decade. In an effort to make this
survey a living artifact, we also provide a public forum that contains the extracted recommendations in the hopes that
the {MSR} community can engage in a continuing discussion on our evolving best practices.},

    abstract = {{Free/Libre} and Open Source Software ({FLOSS}) projects are a form of commons where individuals work
collectively to produce software that is a public, rather than a private, good. The famous phrase "Tragedy of the
Commons" describes a situation where a natural resource commons, such as a pasture, or a water supply, gets depleted
because of overuse. The tragedy in {FLOSS} commons is distinctly different -- it occurs when collective action ceases
before a software product is produced or reaches its full potential. This paper builds on previous work about defining
success in {FLOSS} projects by taking a collective action perspective. We first report the results of interviews with
{FLOSS} developers regarding our ideas about success and failure in {FLOSS} projects. Building on those interviews and
previous work, we then describe our criteria for defining success/tragedy in {FLOSS} commons. Finally, we discuss the
results of a preliminary classification of nearly all projects hosted on 
Sourceforge.net as of August 2006.},

    abstract = {It has long been known that Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) is superior to Euclidean distance for
classification and clustering of time series. However, until lately, most research has utilized Euclidean distance
because it is more efficiently calculated. A recently introduced technique that greatly mitigates {DTWs} demanding {CPU}
time has sparked a flurry of research activity. However, the technique and its many extensions still only allow {DTW} to
be applied to moderately large datasets. In addition, almost all of the research on {DTW} has focused exclusively on
speeding up its calculation; there has been little work done on improving its accuracy. In this work, we target the
accuracy aspect of {DTW} performance and introduce a new framework that learns arbitrary constraints on the warping path
of the {DTW} calculation. Apart from improving the accuracy of classification, our technique as a side effect speeds up
{DTW} by a wide margin as well. We show the utility of our approach on datasets 
from diverse domains and demonstrate significant gains in accuracy and efficiency.},

    abstract = {Classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade. Recent empirical
evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighbor algorithm is very difficult to beat for most time
series problems. While this may be considered good news, given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor
algorithm, there are some negative consequences of this. First, the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing and
searching the entire dataset, resulting in a time and space complexity that limits its applicability, especially on
resource-limited sensors. Second, beyond mere classification accuracy, we often wish to gain some insight into the data.
In this work we introduce a new time series primitive, time series shapelets, which addresses these limitations.
Informally, shapelets are time series subsequences which are in some sense maximally representative of a class. As we
shall show with extensive empirical evaluations in diverse domains, algorithms based on 
the time series shapelet primitives can be interpretable, more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art
classifiers.},

    abstract = {. We propose an indexing method for time sequences for processing similarity queries. We use the
Discrete Fourier Transform ({DFT}) to map time sequences to the frequency domain, the crucial observation being that,
for most sequences of practical interest, only the first few frequencies are strong. Another important observation is
Parseval's theorem, which specifies that the Fourier transform preserves the Euclidean distance in the time or frequency
domain. Having thus mapped sequences to a lowerdimensionality space by using only the first few Fourier coefficients, we
use R    - trees to index the sequences and efficiently answer similarity queries. We provide experimental results which
show that our method is superior to search based on sequential scanning. Our experiments show that a few coefficients
(1-3) are adequate to provide good performance. The performance gain of our method increases with the number and length
of sequences.   On sabbatical from the Dept. of Computer Science, Un...},

with applications including quantitative assessment of motor function, rehabilitation, and elder care. Previous human
activity recognition techniques use a "whole-motion" model in which continuous sensor streams are divided into windows
with a fixed time duration whose length is chosen such that all the relevant information in each activity signal can be
extracted from each window. In this paper, we present a statistical motion primitive-based framework for human activity
representation and recognition. Our framework is based on {Bag-of-Features} ({BoF}), which builds activity models using
histograms of primitive symbols. We experimentally validate the effectiveness the {BoF}-based framework for recognizing
nine activity classes and evaluate six factors which impact the performance of the framework. The factors include window
size, choices of features, methods to construct motion primitives, 
motion vocabulary size, weighting schemes of motion primitive assignments, and learning machine kernel functions.
Finally, we demonstrate that our statistical {BoF}-based framework can achieve much better performance compared to a
non-statistical string-matching-based approach.},

However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the

    abstract = {Classification of time series has been attracting great interest over the past decade. Recent empirical
evidence has strongly suggested that the simple nearest neighbor algorithm is very difficult to beat for most time
series problems. While this may be considered good news, given the simplicity of implementing the nearest neighbor
algorithm, there are some negative consequences of this. First, the nearest neighbor algorithm requires storing and
searching the entire dataset, resulting in a time and space complexity that limits its applicability, especially on
resource-limited sensors. Second, beyond mere classification accuracy, we often wish to gain some insight into the data.
In this work we introduce a new time series primitive, time series shapelets, which addresses these limitations.
Informally, shapelets are time series subsequences which are in some sense maximally representative of a class. As we
shall show with extensive empirical evaluations in diverse domains, algorithms based on 
the time series shapelet primitives can be interpretable, more accurate and significantly faster than state-of-the-art
classifiers.},

    abstract = {Time series shapelets are small, local patterns in a time series that are highly predictive of a class
and are thus very useful features for building classifiers and for certain visualization and summarization tasks. While
shapelets were introduced only recently, they have already seen significant adoption and extension in the community.
Despite their immense potential as a data mining primitive, there are two important limitations of shapelets. First,
their expressiveness is limited to simple binary presence/absence questions. Second, even though shapelets are computed
offline, the time taken to compute them is significant. In this work, we address the latter problem by introducing a
novel algorithm that finds shapelets in less time than current methods by an order of magnitude. Our algorithm is based
on intelligent caching and reuse of computations, and the admissible pruning of the search space. Because our algorithm
is so fast, it creates an opportunity to consider more expressive 
shapelet queries. In particular, we show for the first time an augmented shapelet representation that distinguishes the
data based on conjunctions or disjunctions of shapelets. We call our novel representation {Logical-Shapelets}. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on the classic benchmark datasets used for these problems, and show several
case studies where logical shapelets significantly outperform the original shapelet representation and other time series
classification techniques. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas in domains as diverse as gesture recognition,
robotics, and biometrics.},

disequilibrium extends to 427‚Äì893 kb but, even in samples representative of large heterogeneous populations, such as

disequilibrium mapping of common diseases with {SNPs}. The ‚àà parameter of the Malecot model (recombination and time),
evaluated at each {SNP}, indicates regions of the genome with extensive and less extensive disequilibrium (low and high

                Exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies is a cost efficient approach to
selectively sequencing coding regions of human genome for detection of disease variants. A significant amount of {DNA}
fragments from the capture process fall outside target regions, and sequence data for positions outside target regions
have been mostly ignored after alignment.
                We performed whole exome sequencing on 22 subjects using Agilent {SureSelect} capture reagent and 6
subjects using Illumina {TrueSeq} capture reagent. We also downloaded sequencing data for 6 subjects from the 1000
Genomes Project Pilot 3 study. Using these data, we examined the quality of {SNPs} detected outside target regions by
computing consistency rate with genotypes obtained from {SNP} chips or the Hapmap database, transition-transversion
({Ti/Tv}) ratio, and percentage of {SNPs} inside {dbSNP}. For all three platforms, we obtained high-quality {SNPs}
outside target regions, and some far from target regions. In our Agilent {SureSelect} data, we obtained 84,049
high-quality {SNPs} outside target regions compared to 65,231 {SNPs} inside target regions (a 129\% increase). For our
Illumina {TrueSeq} data, we obtained 222,171 high-quality {SNPs} outside target regions compared to 95,818 {SNPs} inside
target regions (a 232\% increase). For the data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we obtained 7,
139 high-quality {SNPs} outside target regions compared to 1,548 {SNPs} inside target regions (a 461\% increase).
                These results demonstrate that a significant amount of high quality genotypes outside target regions can
be obtained from exome sequencing data. These data should not be ignored in genetic epidemiology studies.

                Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently controlled in mammals. On the
other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that
the most of its {DNA} gives rise to {RNAs}. This raises the question of whether it is possible to pinpoint and activate
a particular locus without perturbing numerous neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at
one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of immediate-early genes ({IEGs})
in response to growth factor stimulations is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the
primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated simultaneous activation of transcription
centred on {IEGs}. Even in surrounding intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time.
Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the {IEG} 
induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) pathway or the
transcription factor {SRF} suppresses all transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional
activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated expression.

theories about software engineering suggested by the history of Linux. I discuss these theories in terms of two
fundamentally different development styles, the "cathedral" model, representing most of the commercial world, versus the
"bazaar" model of the Linux world. I show that these models derive from opposing assumptions about the nature of the
software-debugging task. I then make a sustained argument from the Linux experience for the proposition that "Given
enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow," suggest productive analogies with other self-correcting systems of selfish
agents, and conclude with some exploration of the implications of this insight for the future of software.},

Modeling ({SPM}) has received significant attention over the last three decades. Although empirical research plays a
critical role in software engineering, the state-of-the-practice of empirical research in {SPM} has not been

analyzing all refereed studies that were published in relevant venues from 1987 to 2008 using systematic review
methodology. The primary findings indicate that in current {SPM}-related empirical studies, (1) software process
management and improvement ({SPI}) was not yet the most popular primary research objectives, (2) exploratory empirical
research methods, e.g., case study and action research, were dominantly used, (3) there were common issues in empirical
research reports in terms of following rigorous reporting guidelines. Based on the review results, we also 
suggest the future needs for empirical research in {SPM}, in terms of research topics, {SPM} techniques, the strengths
of research methodology and the rigors of empirical studies.},

professional software engineers. A question remains, however, as to the place for software engineering in undergraduate
studies. To date, most work in undergraduate software engineering education has been performed by small clusters of
computer science and engineering faculty, widely dispersed throughout academia. Building on recommendations from the
Software Engineering Institute ({SEI}), the Association for Computing Machinery ({ACM}), and the {IEEE} Computer
Society, these initial efforts have begun to bear fruit. Typically, the result is a set of software engineering courses
arranged according to one of the following formats: (a) an elective or required course sequence; (b) elective noncredit
paracticums; and (c) software engineering topics introduced in existing courses. The paper discusses: (a) What is the
proper relationship between typical engineering programs and those in software 
engineering? (b) How should software engineering education differ from both computer science and computer engineering?
(c) If undergraduate program degrees in software engineering are developed, how should such programs interact with other
engineering programs? and (d) How are minors and concentrations in software engineering affected by the presence of a
baccalaureate in software engineering?},

organizations are keen to tap into this significant pool of software development talent. These companies seek to benefit

This merging of open and traditional software development may cause developer stress based on conflicting {OSS}

property concerns with the reciprocal and community-based norms that drive {OSS} development. When these values are not
in sync, contributors that aim to abide by conflicting values may exhibit dysfunctional attitudes. Employee stress with

({MSR}) researchers deal with a problem of discovery of interesting and 
actionable information about software projects. It is
a common practice to perform analyzes on the various levels
of abstraction of change events, for example by aggregating
change-events into time-series. Following this, I investigate
the applicability of {SAX}-based approximation and indexing of
time-series with tf‚àóidf weights in order to discover recurrent
behaviors within development process. The proposed workÔ¨Çow
starts by extracting and aggregating of revision control data
and followed by reduction and transformation of aggregated
data into symbolic space with {PAA} and {SAX}. Resulting {SAX}
words then grouped into dictionaries associated with software
process constraints known to inÔ¨Çuence behaviors, such as time,
location, employment, etc. These, in turn, are investigated with
the use of tf‚àóidf statistics as a dissimilarity measure in order
to discover behavioral patterns.
As a proof of the concept I have applied this technique to
software process artifact trails corresponding to Android {OS}
development, where it was able to discover recurrent behaviors
in the  ‚Äù new code lines dynamics‚Äù before and after release.
By building a classiÔ¨Åer upon these behaviors, I was able to
successfully recognize pre- and post-release behaviors within
the same and similar sub-projects of Android {OS}.},

    abstract = {The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms are usually regarded as
independent. It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than
of term meaning. The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test
collections showing, in particular, that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is
argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific,
terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable
improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure. Exhaustivity and specificity We are familiar
with the notions of exhaustivity and specificity: exhaustivity is a property of index descriptions, and specificity one
of index terms. They are most clearly illustrated by a simple keyword or 
descriptor system. In this case the exhaustivity of a document description is the coverage of its various topics given
by the terms assigned to it; and the specificity of an individual term is the level of detail at which a given concept
is represented.},

    abstract = {Previous taxonomies of software change have focused on the purpose of the change (i.e., the why) rather
than the underlying mechanisms. This paper proposes a taxonomy of software change based on characterizing the mechanisms
of change and the factors that influence these mechanisms. The ultimate goal of this taxonomy is to provide a framework
that positions concrete tools, formalisms and methods within the domain of software evolution. Such a framework would
considerably ease comparison between the various mechanisms of change. It would also allow practitioners to identify and
evaluate the relevant tools, methods and formalisms for a particular change scenario. As an initial step towards this
taxonomy, the paper presents a framework that can be used to characterize software change support tools and to identify
the factors that impact on the use of these tools. The framework is evaluated by applying it to three different change
support tools and by comparing these tools based on this analysis.

    abstract = {Frequent itemset originates from association rule mining. Recently, it has been applied in text mining
such as document categorization, clustering, etc. In this paper, we conduct a study on text clustering using frequent
itemsets. The main contribution of this paper is three manifolds. First, we present a review on existing methods of
document clustering using frequent patterns. Second, a new method called Maximum Capturing is proposed for document
clustering. Maximum Capturing includes two procedures: constructing document clusters and assigning cluster topics. We
develop three versions of Maximum Capturing based on three similarity measures. We propose a normalization process based
on frequency sensitive competitive learning for Maximum Capturing to merge cluster candidates into predefined number of
clusters. Third, experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed method in comparison with {CFWS}, {CMS}, {FTC} and
{FIHC} methods. Experiment results show that in clustering, Maximum 
Capturing has better performances than other methods mentioned above. Particularly, Maximum Capturing with
representation using individual words and similarity measure using asymmetrical binary similarity achieves the best
performance. Moreover, topics produced by Maximum Capturing distinguished clusters from each other and can be used as
labels of document clusters.},

    abstract = {Most of existing text clustering algorithms use the vector space model, which treats documents as bags
of words. Thus, word sequences in the documents are ignored, while the meaning of natural languages strongly depends on
them. In this paper, we propose two new text clustering algorithms, named Clustering based on Frequent Word Sequences
({CFWS}) and Clustering based on Frequent Word Meaning Sequences ({CFWMS}). A word is the word form showing in the
document, and a word meaning is the concept expressed by synonymous word forms. A word (meaning) sequence is frequent if
it occurs in more than certain percentage of the documents in the text database. The frequent word (meaning) sequences
can provide compact and valuable information about those text documents. For experiments, we used the Reuters-21578 text

corpus of the Text Retrieval Conference ({TREC}) [High Accuracy Retrieval

    abstract = {The problem of finding a specified pattern in a time series database (i.e., query by content) has
received much attention and is now a relatively mature field. In contrast, the important problem of enumerating all
surprising or interesting patterns has received far less attention. This problem requires a meaningful definition of  ‚Äù
surprise‚Äù, and an efficient search technique. All previous attempts at finding surprising patterns in time series use a
very limited notion of surprise, and/or do not scale to massive datasets. To overcome these limitations we propose a
novel technique that defines a pattern surprising if the frequency of its occurrence differs substantially from that
expected by chance, given some previously seen data. This notion has the advantage of not requiring the user to
explicitly define what is a surprising pattern, which may be hard, or perhaps impossible, to elicit from a domain
expert. Instead, the user gives the algorithm a collection of previously observed  ‚Äù normal‚Äù 
data. Our algorithm uses a suffix tree to efficiently encode the frequency of all observed patterns and allows a Markov
model to predict the expected frequency of previously unobserved patterns. Once the suffix tree has been constructed, a
measure of surprise for all the patterns in a new database can be determined in time and space linear in the size of the
database. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with an extensive experimental evaluation.},

    abstract = {Time series of remote sensing imagery or derived vegetation indices and biophysical products have been
shown particularly useful to characterize land ecosystem dynamics. Various methods have been developed based on temporal
trajectory analysis to characterize, classify and detect changes in ecosystem dynamics. Although time series similarity
measures play an important role in these methods, a quantitative comparison of the similarity measures is lacking. The
objective of this study was to provide an overview and quantitative comparison of the similarity measures in function of
varying time series and ecosystem characteristics, such as amplitude, timing and noise effects. For this purpose, the
performance was evaluated for the commonly used similarity measures (D), ranging from Manhattan ({DMan}), Euclidean
({DE}) and Mahalanobis ({DMah}) distance measures, to correlation ({DCC}), Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}; {DPCA})
and Fourier based ({DFFT},{D\^{I}¬æ,DFk}) similarities. The 
quantitative comparison consists of a series of {Monte-Carlo} simulations based on subsets of global {MODIS} Normalized
Difference Vegetation index ({NDVI}) and Enhanced Vegetation Index ({EVI}) and Leaf Area Index ({LAI}) data. Results of
the simulations reveal four main groups of time series similarity measures with different sensitivities: (i) {DMan},
{DE}, {DPCA}, {DFk} quantify the difference in time series values, (ii) {DMah} accounts for temporal correlation and
non-stationarity of variance, (iii) {DCC} measures the temporal correlation, and (iv) the Fourier based {DFFT} and
D\^{I}¬æ show their specific sensitivity based on the selected Fourier components. The difference measures show
relatively the highest sensitivity to amplitude effects, whereas the correlation based measures are highly sensitive to
variations in timing and noise. The Fourier based measures, finally, depend highly on the signal to noise ratio and the
balance between amplitude and phase dominance. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of 
each D stresses the importance of (i) understanding the time series characteristics before applying any classification
of change detection approach and (ii) defining the variability one wants to identify/account for. This requires an
understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and time series characteristics related to the baseline, amplitude, timing,
noise and variability of the ecosystem time series. This is also illustrated in the quantitative comparison, where the
different sensitivities of D for the {NDVI}, {EVI}, and {LAI} data relate specifically to the temporal characteristics
of each data set. Additionally, the effect of noise and intra- and interclass variability is demonstrated in a case
study based on land cover classification. \^{a}¬ñ¬∫ A quantitative comparison of time series similarity measures D is
performed. \^{a}¬ñ¬∫ Four groups of D with different sensitivities are obtained. \^{a}¬ñ¬∫ Time series characteristics,
noise and variability affect the performance of D. \^{a}¬ñ¬∫ The sensitivities stress the 
importance of proper selection of similarity measures. \^{a}¬ñ¬∫ Understanding time series properties is crucial for
classification/change detection.},

There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining
research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of
time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including
general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the
performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time
series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs
are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or
frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with 
models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible
topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also
summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those
interested in advancing this area of research.},

today. It is hoped that {FEAST}/1 will provide a foundation for mastering

computer-assisted telephone interviews, overselection of children and weekends in the 24-h recall diary and the same
interviewers. Very similar response rates were obtained: 63\% ({NHAPS}) and 64.5\% ({CHAPS}). Results of comparisons by
age within major activity and location groups suggest activity and location patterns are very similar (most differences
being less than 1\% or 14 min in a 24-h day) with the exception of seasonal differences. Canadians spend less time
outdoors in winter and less time indoors in summer than their {U.S}. counterparts. When 
exposure assessments use time of year or outdoor/indoor exposure gradients, these differences may result in significant
differences in exposure assessments. Otherwise, the 24-h time activity patterns of North Americans are remarkably

metadata is a rich source of social characteristics, including the commit's time of day and the experience and commit

investigate the correlation between a commit's social characteristics and its "bugginess"; such results can be very
useful for software developers and software engineering researchers. For instance, developers or code reviewers might be
well-advised to thoroughly verify commits that are more likely to be buggy. In this paper, we study the correlation
between a commit's bugginess and the time of day of the commit, the day of week of the commit, and the experience and
commit frequency of the commit authors. We survey two widely-used open source projects: the Linux kernel and
{PostgreSQL}. Our main findings include: (1) commits submitted between midnight and 4 {AM} (
referred to as late-night commits) are significantly buggier and commits between 7 {AM} and noon are less buggy,
implying that developers may want to double-check their own latenight commits; (2) daily-committing developers produce
less-buggy commits, indicating that we may want to promote the practice of daily-committing developers reviewing other
developers' commits; and (3) the bugginess of commits versus day-of-week varies for different software projects.},

an analogy of P(d|q) and the probabilistic odds O(r|d, q) mirrors relevance feedback. For disjoint terms, a relationship
between probability theory and {TF}-{IDF} is established through the integral + 1/x dx = log x. This study uncovers
components such as divergence from randomness and pivoted document length to be inherent parts of a document-query

    abstract = {This paper presents an approach to recover time variant information from software repositories. It is
widely accepted that software evolves due to factors such as defect removal, market opportunity or adding new features.
Software evolution details are stored in software repositories which often contain the changes history. On the other
hand there is a lack of approaches, technologies and methods to efficiently extract and represent time dependent
information. Disciplines such as signal and image processing or speech recognition adopt frequency domain
representations to mitigate differences of signals evolving in time. Inspired by time-frequency duality, this paper
proposes the use of Linear Predictive Coding ({LPC}) and Cepstrum coefficients to model time varying software artifact
histories. {LPC} or Cepstrum allow obtaining very compact representations with linear complexity. These representations
can be used to highlight components and artifacts evolved in the same way or with very similar 
evolution patterns. To assess the proposed approach we applied {LPC} and Cepstral analysis to 211 Linux kernel releases
(i.e., from 1.0 to 1.3.100), to identify files with very similar size histories. The approach, the preliminary results
and the lesson learned are presented in this paper.},

                Most sequence comparison methods assume that the data being compared are trustworthy, but this is not
the case with raw {DNA} sequences obtained from automatic sequencing machines. Nevertheless, sequence comparisons need
to be done on them in order to remove vector splice sites and contaminants. This step is necessary before other genomic
data processing stages can be carried out, such as fragment assembly or {EST} clustering. A specialized tool is
therefore needed to solve this apparent dilemma.
                We have designed and implemented a program that specifically addresses the problem. This program, called
{LUCY}, has been in use since 1998 at The Institute for Genomic Research ({TIGR}). During this period, many rounds of
experience-driven modifications were made to {LUCY} to improve its accuracy and its ability to deal with extremely
difficult input cases. We believe we have finally obtained a useful program which strikes a delicate balance among the
many issues involved in the raw sequence cleaning problem, and we wish to share it with the research community.
                {LUCY} is available directly from {TIGR} (http://www.tigr.org/softlab). Academic users can download
{LUCY} after accepting a free academic use license. Business users may need to pay a license fee to use {LUCY} for
commercial purposes.
                Questions regarding the quality assessment module of {LUCY} should be directed to Michael Holmes

in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and
that such compromises incur a "debt": on which "interest" has to be paid and which the "principal" should be repaid at
some point for the long-term health of the project. We argue that the software engineering research community has an
opportunity to study and improve this concept. We can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such trade-offs

                Indole Acetic Acid 9 ({IAA9}) is a negative auxin response regulator belonging to the {Aux/IAA}
transcription factor gene family whose downregulation triggers fruit set before pollination, thus giving rise to
parthenocarpy. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that a tissue-specific gradient of {IAA9} expression is
established during flower development, the release of which upon pollination triggers the initiation of fruit
development. Comparative transcriptome and targeted metabolome analysis uncovered important features of the molecular
events underlying pollination-induced and pollination-independent fruit set. Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling
identified a high number of genes common to both types of fruit set, among which only a small subset are dependent on
{IAA9} regulation. The fine-tuning of {Aux/IAA} and {ARF} genes and the downregulation of {TAG1} and {TAGL6} {MADS} box
genes are instrumental in triggering the fruit set program. Auxin and ethylene emerged as the most 
active signaling hormones involved in the flower-to-fruit transition. However, while these hormones affected only a
small number of transcriptional events, dramatic shifts were observed at the metabolic and developmental levels. The
activation of photosynthesis and sucrose metabolism-related genes is an integral regulatory component of fruit set
process. The combined results allow a far greater comprehension of the regulatory and metabolic events controlling early
fruit development both in the presence and absence of pollination/fertilization.

    abstract = {Based on an invited address, "Behaving Like a Manager," as part of the All Academy
{Centennial/Anniversary} Symposium of the national, annual meeting of the Academy of Management, this paper by Simon
addresses the popular topic of the "rational" and "non-rational" components in the behavior of effective managers.
Previous discussion of this topic has been hampered by the lack of a precise characterization of the nonrational
components--specifically a characterization of the mechanisms of managerial judgment and intuition. Simon provides a
description of intuitive and judgmental processes and a sketch of the evidence that is available to support this
description. Further, his paper shows how intuition and judgment rest on extensive experience and knowledge; how, in
fact, they can be understood in terms of the recognition of cues and the consequent evocation from memory of relevant
experiences. In a final section of the paper, Simon discusses some of the pathologies commonly encountered in 
managerial behavior, both those produced by emotions and stress and those arising from the lack of appropriate
habits--that is to say, of appropriate intuitive responses. This diagnosis leads Simon to some rather specific
conclusions about the kinds of intuitions that need to be cultivated and habituated in organizations, and some of the
ways in which they can be developed.},

@book{citeulike:1414171,
    abstract = {Most of Barnard's career was spent in executive practice. A Mount Hermon and
Harvard education, cut off short of the bachelor's degree, was followed by
nearly forty years in the American Telephone \& Telegraph Company. His career
began in the Statistical Department, took him to technical expertness in the
economics of rates and administrative experience in the management of
commercial operations, and culminated in the presidency of the New Jersey Bell
Telephone Company. He was not directly involved in the Western Electric
experiments conducted chiefly at the Hawthorne plant in Cicero, but his
association with Elton Mayo and the latter's colleagues at the Harvard
Business School had an important bearing on his most original ideas.

Barnard's executive experience at {AT}\&T was paralleled and followed by a career
in public service unusual in his own time and hardly routine today. He was at
various times president of the United Services Organization (the {USO} of World
War {II}), head of the General Education Board and later president of the
Rockefeller Foundation (after Raymond Fosdick and before Dean Rusk), chairman
of the National Science Foundation, an assistant to the Secretary of the
Treasury, a consultant to the American representative in the United Nations
Atomic Energy Committee, to name only some of his public interests. He was a
director of a number of companies, a fellow of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
He was a lover of music and a founder of the Bach Society of New Jersey.},

@article{citeulike:3112209,
    abstract = {Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of the transcriptome present in
eukaryotic cells is one of the most challenging tasks in the postgenomic era. In this regard, alternative splicing
({AS}) is a key phenomenon contributing to the production of different mature transcripts from the same primary {RNA}
sequence. As a plethora of different transcript forms is available in databases, a first step to uncover the biology
that drives {AS} is to identify the different types of reflected splicing variation. In this work, we present a general
definition of the {AS} event along with a notation system that involves the relative positions of the splice sites. This
nomenclature univocally and dynamically assigns a specific  ‚Äù {AS} code‚Äù to every possible pattern of splicing
variation. On the basis of this definition and the corresponding codes, we have developed a computational tool
({AStalavista}) that automatically characterizes the complete landscape of {AS} events in a 
given transcript annotation of a genome, thus providing a platform to investigate the transcriptome diversity across
genes, chromosomes, and species. Our analysis reveals that a substantial part‚Äîin human more than a quarter‚Äîof the
observed splicing variations are ignored in common classification pipelines. We have used {AStalavista} to investigate
and to compare the {AS} landscape of different reference annotation sets in human and in other metazoan species and
found that proportions of {AS} events change substantially depending on the annotation protocol, species-specific
attributes, and coding constraints acting on the transcripts. The {AStalavista} system therefore provides a general
framework to conduct specific studies investigating the occurrence, impact, and regulation of {AS}. The genome sequence
is said to be an organism's blueprint, a set of instructions driving the organism's biology. The unfolding of these
instructions‚Äîthe so-called genes‚Äîis initiated by the transcription of {DNA} into {RNA} 
molecules, which subsequently are processed before they can take their functional role. During this processing step,
initially identical {RNA} molecules may result in different products through a process known as alternative splicing
({AS}). {AS} therefore allows for widening the diversity from the limited repertoire of genes, and it is often
postulated as an explanation for the apparent paradox that complex and simple organisms resemble in their number of
genes; it characterizes species, individuals, and developmental and cellular conditions. Comparing the differences of
{AS} products between cells may help to reveal the broad molecular basis underlying phenotypic differences‚Äîfor instance,
between a cancer and a normal cell. An obstacle for such comparisons has been that, so far, no paradigm existed to
delineate each single quantum of {AS}, so-called {AS} events. Here, we describe a possibility of exhaustively
decomposing {AS} complements into qualitatively different groups of events and a nomenclature to 
unequivocally denote them. This typological catalogue of {AS} events along with their observed frequencies represent the
{AS} landscape, and we propose a procedure to automatically identify such landscapes. We use it to describe the human
{AS} landscape and to investigate how it has changed throughout evolution.},

    abstract = {Although Manduca sexta has significantly contributed to our knowledge on a variety of insect
physiological processes, the lack of its genome sequence hampers the large-scale gene discovery, transcript profiling,
and proteomic analysis in this biochemical model species. Here we report our implementation of the {RNA}-Seq {cDNA}
sequencing approach based on massively parallel pyrosequencing, which allows us to categorize transcripts based on their
relative abundances and to discover process- or tissue-specifically regulated genes simultaneously. We obtained
1,821,652 reads with an average length of 289¬†bp per read from fat body and hemocytes of na\"{i}ve and microbe-injected
M.¬†sexta larvae. After almost all (92.1\%) of these reads were assembled into 19,020 contigs, we identified 528 contigs
whose relative abundances increased at least 5- and 8-fold in fat body and hemocytes, respectively, after the microbial
challenge. Polypeptides encoded by these contigs include pathogen recognition 
receptors, extracellular and intracellular signal mediators and regulators, antimicrobial peptides, and proteins with no
known sequence but likely participating in defense in novel ways. We also found 250 and 161 contigs that were
preferentially expressed in fat body and hemocytes, respectively. Furthermore, we integrated data from our previous
study and generated a sequence database to support future gene annotation and proteomic analysis in M.¬†sexta. In
summary, we have successfully established a combined approach for gene discovery and expression profiling in organisms
lacking known genome sequences.},

                High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools
for investigating a wide range of biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are key for
drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We
provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression ({DE}) analysis of
Illumina transcriptome sequencing ({mRNA}-Seq) data.
                We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly {DE} between two types of
biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We
evaluate how {DE} results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths,
base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We
investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on {DE} results and show that the standard approach of
scaling by total lane counts (e.g., {RPKM}) can bias estimates of {DE}. We propose more general quantile-based
normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in {DE} detection.
                Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of
{mRNA}-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and {DE}
inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also
reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for {mRNA}-Seq.

major and minor releases; we do this by partitioning the observed activities, such as artifact check-ins, around the
dates of major and minor releases, and then look for recognizable patterns. We validate this approach by means of a case
study on the {MySQL} database system; in this case study, we found patterns which suggested {MySQL} was behaving
consistently within itself. These patterns included testing and documenting that took place more before a release than
after and that the rate of source code changes dipped around release time.},

critical go/no-go decision. The cost of a false positive, allowing a launch in spite of a fault, or a false negative,
stopping a potentially successful launch, can be measured in the tens of millions of dollars, not including the cost in
morale and other more intangible detriments. The Aerospace Corporation is responsible for providing engineering
assessments critical to the go/no-go decision for every Department of Defense space vehicle. These assessments are made
by constantly monitoring streaming telemetry data in the hours before launch. We will introduce {VizTree}, a novel
time-series visualization tool to aid the Aerospace analysts who must make these engineering assessments. {VizTree} was
developed at the University of California, Riverside and is unique in that the same tool is used for mining archival
data and monitoring incoming live telemetry. The use of a single tool for both aspects 
of the task allows a natural and intuitive transfer of mined knowledge to the monitoring task. Our visualization
approach works by transforming the time series into a symbolic representation, and encoding the data in a modified
suffix tree in which the frequency and other properties of patterns are mapped onto colors and other visual properties.
We demonstrate the utility of our system by comparing it with state-of-the-art batch algorithms on several real and

structure‚Äìfunction analyses within an ant's central olfactory system asking whether in the carpenter ant, Camponotus
floridanus, the olfactory pathway exhibits adaptations to processing many pheromonal and general odors. Using
fluorescent tracing, confocal microscopy, and {3D}-analyses we demonstrate that the antennal lobe ({AL}) contains up to
‚âà460 olfactory glomeruli organized in seven distinct clusters innervated via seven antennal sensory tracts. The {AL} is
divided into two hemispheres regarding innervation of glomeruli by either projection neurons ({PNs}) with axons leaving
via the medial (m) or lateral (l) antennocerebral tract ({ACT}). M- and {l-ACT} {PNs} differ in their target areas in
the mushroom-body calyx and lateral horn. Three additional {ACTs} project to the lateral protocerebrum only. We analyzed
odor processing in {AL} glomeruli by retrograde loading of {PNs} with Fura-2 
dextran and fluorimetric calcium imaging. Odor responses were reproducible and comparable across individuals. Calcium
responses to pheromonal and nonpheromonal odors were very sensitive (10‚àí11 dilution) and patterns were partly
overlapping, indicating that processing of both odor classes is not spatially segregated within the {AL}. Response
patterns to the main trail-pheromone component nerolic acid remained stable over a wide range of intensities (7‚Äì8 log
units), while response durations increased indicating that odor quality is maintained by a stable pattern and intensity
is mainly encoded in response durations. The structure‚Äìfunction analyses contribute new insights into important aspects

olfactory receptor ({OR}) gene family, along with the highly conserved and broadly expressed Or83b co-receptor1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The functional insect {OR} consists of a heteromeric complex of unknown stoichiometry but comprising
at least one variable odorant-binding subunit and one constant Or83b family subunit10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Insect
{ORs} lack homology to G-protein-coupled chemosensory receptors in vertebrates17 and possess a distinct
seven-transmembrane topology with the amino terminus located intracellularly10, 18. Here we provide evidence that
heteromeric insect {ORs} comprise a new class of ligand-activated non-selective cation channels. Heterologous cells
expressing silkmoth, fruitfly or mosquito heteromeric {OR} complexes showed extracellular Ca2+ influx and
cation-non-selective ion conductance on stimulation with odorant. Odour-evoked {OR} currents are 
independent of known G-protein-coupled second messenger pathways. The fast response kinetics and {OR}-subunit-dependent
K+ ion selectivity of the insect {OR} complex support the hypothesis that the complex between {OR} and Or83b itself
confers channel activity. Direct evidence for odorant-gated channels was obtained by outside-out patch-clamp recording
of Xenopus oocyte and {HEK293T} cell membranes expressing insect {OR} complexes. The ligand-gated ion channel formed by
an insect {OR} complex seems to be the basis for a unique strategy that insects have acquired to respond to the
olfactory environment.},

    abstract = {From worm to man, many odorant signals are perceived by the binding of volatile ligands to odorant
receptors1 that belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor ({GPCR}) family2. They couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins,
most of which induce {cAMP} production3. This second messenger then activates cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channels to
depolarize the olfactory receptor neuron, thus providing a signal for further neuronal processing. Recent findings,
however, have challenged this concept of odorant signal transduction in insects, because their odorant receptors, which
lack any sequence similarity to other {GPCRs4}, are composed of conventional odorant receptors (for example, Or22a),
dimerized with a ubiquitously expressed chaperone protein5, such as Or83b in Drosophila6. Or83b has a structure akin to
{GPCRs}, but has an inverted orientation in the plasma membrane4, 7. However, G proteins are expressed in insect
olfactory receptor neurons8, and olfactory perception is modified by mutations 
affecting the {cAMP} transduction pathway9. Here we show that application of odorants to mammalian cells co-expressing
Or22a and Or83b results in non-selective cation currents activated by means of an ionotropic and a metabotropic pathway,
and a subsequent increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Expression of Or83b alone leads to functional ion
channels not directly responding to odorants, but being directly activated by intracellular {cAMP} or {cGMP}. Insect
odorant receptors thus form ligand-gated channels as well as complexes of odorant-sensing units and
cyclic-nucleotide-activated non-selective cation channels. Thereby, they provide rapid and transient as well as
sensitive and prolonged odorant signalling.},

the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project database ( approximately 1/5 of the genome) to identify a family of novel seven
transmembrane domain encoding genes that are putative Drosophila olfactory receptors. Members of the family are
expressed in distinct subsets of olfactory neurons, and certain family members are restricted to distinct portions of
the olfactory system. This pattern of expression has interesting similarities to and differences from the expression
patterns observed for olfactory receptors in vertebrates. The Drosophila olfactory system is simpler than mammalian
systems, yet it is complex enough to present a fascinating system in which to study neural information processing.
Moreover, the powerful genetic manipulations available in Drosophila, when combined with electrophysiological and
behavioral analyses, make this an attractive model system in which to study olfactory 
discrimination.},

@article{citeulike:5969737,
    abstract = { In the fruit fly Drosophila, not all olfactory sensory neurons express a seven transmembrane odorant
receptor, suggesting that other types of odorant receptors might exist. Benton et al. (2009) now present evidence that a
family of proteins related to ionotropic glutamate receptors is a previously unrecognized class of odorant receptors.
Main {TextOdor} detection is accomplished by odorant receptors, originally identified in rodents as a large family of
seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}). Odorant receptors have subsequently been found in fish and
nematodes, and eventually in the fruit fly Drosophila (Bargmann, 2006). Surprisingly, Drosophila seven transmembrane
odorant receptors ({ORs}) were recently found to have inverted membrane topology compared to typical {GPCRs}, with their
N terminus facing the cytoplasm rather than the extracellular space (Benton et al., 2006). Additionally, Drosophila
{ORs} require Or83b, another seven transmembrane protein highly conserved in 
insects, as an obligate coreceptor (Larsson et al., 2004). Indeed, evidence suggests that {OR}/Or83b complexes form
ligand-gated ion channels ([Sato et al., 2008] and [Wicher et al., 2008]), a striking difference to {GPCRs} in worms and
vertebrates that rely on second messengers to activate ion channels. In this issue, Benton et al. (2009) report the
identification of a new class of odorant receptors that are related to ionotropic glutamate receptors, thus expanding
the known repertoire of odorant receptors beyond the classical family of seven transmembrane {receptors.In} the
Drosophila olfactory system, olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs}, also known as olfactory receptor neurons or {ORNs})
located in the antennae and maxillary palps send axons to the antennal lobe in the central brain. {OSN} dendrites are
present in sensory organs called sensilla, where they are exposed to the environment, and the different types of
sensilla (basiconic, coeloconic, and trichoid) respond to different types of odorants (Figure 
1). Just as in the mammalian olfactory system, most Drosphila {OSNs} express a single {OR}, and {OSN} axons expressing
the same {OR} converge on the same glomerulus in the antennal lobe (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007). Nearly every {OR} has
been genetically mapped for its expression in specific sensilla and for its corresponding {OSN} axon projection to a
specific glomerulus (Couto et al., 2005). With one exception, all {ORs} are expressed in basiconic and trichoid {OSNs}.
Or35a is expressed in coeloconic {OSNs} which project to only one of eight glomeruli predicted to be targets of
coeloconic {OSNs}. Exhaustive study of {ORs} and gustatory receptors (two gustatory receptors are coexpressed in
{CO2}-sensing {OSNs}, see Figure 1) still leaves most coeloconic {OSNs} unaccounted for with regard to the identity of
the odorant receptors they express (Couto et al., 2005). This indicated that an unidentified class of odorant receptors
could be present in most coeloconic {OSNs}. Benton et al. (2009) now present 
convincing evidence that a family of proteins related to ionotropic glutamate receptors fill this role. Benton et al.
identified this family of receptors, which they named ionotropic receptors ({IRs}), in a bioinformatic screen for genes
expressed in the fly antennae. Subsequent {BLAST} searches revealed a family of 61 genes in Drosophila. Despite having a
similar modular organization to the ionotropic glutamate receptors extensively studied for their role in synaptic
transmission, such as {AMPA} and {NMDA} receptors, the {IRs} show wide divergence at the sequence level and in
particular show considerable variations in residues known to be important for glutamate binding. Thus, these {IRs} are
unlikely to be glutamate receptors, but may instead bind other {ligands.Multiple} lines of evidence indicate that {IRs}
are indeed the missing coeloconic odorant receptors. First, {mRNAs} of 15 {IRs} are specifically expressed in neurons of
the adult antenna. Second, an antibody that specifically recognized one {IR} 
protein stained the dendrites of {OSNs}, consistent with a role in odor detection. Third, the {IR}-positive {OSNs} are
distinct from Or83b-expressing {OSNs}, as assayed by double in situ analysis (with the exception of coeloconic {OSNs}
coexpressing {Or35a/Or83b}/Ir76b). Fourth, in mutants that disrupt coeloconic sensilla development, {IR} expression is
lost. Fifth, {IR} expression maps into four clusters of neurons corresponding to the four coeloconic sensilla types
previously characterized physiologically (Yao et al., 2005). Sixth, just as {OSNs} expressing a common {OR} project
their axons to a single glomerulus, axons labeled by {Ir76a-GAL4} converge to a single glomerulus previously identified
as having coeloconic input. Finally, misexpression of {IRs} is sufficient to bestow new odor sensitivity to coeloconic
{OSNs}, indicating that {IRs} determine odor {specificity.There} appear to be important organizational differences
between {OSNs} that express {IRs} and those that express {ORs}. Multiple {IRs} 
can be coexpressed per neuron, which is strikingly different than {OR} expression, which generally follows a one
neuron-one receptor rule. This may reflect a functional requirement for more than one {IR} to form a functional channel.
{NMDA} receptors, for instance, are a tetramer composed of different subunits. Although Ir76a axons target a single
glomerulus, this may not be a general rule, as Ir76a is one of the few {IRs} expressed in a single class of coeloconic
{OSNs}. The odor responses of {IR}-expressing {OSNs} may be defined by expression of a particular set of {IRs} rather
than a single {IR} gene, so a given {IR} may label axons projecting to multiple {glomeruli.These} important results by
Benton et al. lend themselves to several lines of future study. Biologically, the identification of {IRs} should allow
comprehensive mapping of odor specificity and glomerular projection of specific {IR}-expressing {OSNs}. It is already
known that a division of labor exists between the trichoid sensilla that 
putatively sense pheromones and the basiconic sensilla that sense food odorants, and this division is even propagated to
higher olfactory centers (Jefferis et al., 2007). Future studies will determine whether coeloconic {OSNs} have
particular odor specialties and how this information is represented in the brain. Mechanistically, it is important to
extend the sufficiency test beyond ectopic expression of {IRs} in other coeloconic {OSNs}. For instance, reconstituting
the odor response in ectopic cells such as Xenopus oocytes would allow the dissection of biochemical and biophysical
properties of the {IR} receptor/channel {complex.The} identification of {IRs} as odorant receptors also raises
interesting evolutionary questions. Ionotropic glutamate receptors at synapses and {IRs} in odor detection both function
by sensing molecules in the extracellular environment, an ancient faculty dating back to prokaryotes (Bargmann, 2006).
Various families of  ‚Äù chemosensors‚Äù may have been coopted numerous times through 
evolution for purposes as diverse as olfaction, immunity, and neurotransmission. A second consideration is the
difference between olfaction in insects and other animals, namely that insect odorant receptors could function
independently from second messengers. Whether this distinction allows some evolutionary advantage, such as a more rapid
signaling, is yet to be determined. One thing is certain: insights from Drosophila olfaction continue to yield surprises
while deepening our understanding of general biological principles. },

transduction pathways triggered by hormones, odorants, peptides, proteins, and other types of ligands. The superfamily
is so diverse that many members lack sequence similarity, although they all span the cell membrane seven times with an
extracellular N and a cytosolic C terminus. We analyzed a divergent set of {GPCRs} and found distinct loop length
patterns and differences in amino acid composition between cytosolic loops, extracellular loops, and membrane regions.
We configured {GPCRHMM}, a hidden Markov model, to fit those features and trained it on a large dataset representing the
entire superfamily. {GPCRHMM} was benchmarked to profile {HMMs} and generic transmembrane detectors on sets of known
{GPCRs} and {non-GPCRs}. In a cross-validation procedure, profile {HMMs} produced an error rate nearly twice as high as
{GPCRHMM}. In a sensitivity-selectivity test, {GPCRHMM}'s sensitivity was 
about 15\% higher than that of the best transmembrane predictors, at comparable false positive rates. We used {GPCRHMM}
to search for novel members of the {GPCR} superfamily in five proteomes. All in all we detected 120 sequences that
lacked annotation and are potentially novel {GPCRs}. Out of those 102 were found in Caenorhabditis elegans, four in
human, and seven in mouse. Many predictions (65) belonged to Pfam domains of unknown function. {GPCRHMM} strongly
rejected a family of arthropod-specific odorant receptors believed to be {GPCRs}. A detailed analysis showed that these

    abstract = {Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs}) each express two odorant receptors ({ORs}): a divergent
member of the {OR} family and the highly conserved, broadly expressed receptor {OR83b}. {OR83b} is essential for
olfaction in vivo and enhances {OR} function in vitro, but the molecular mechanism by which it acts is unknown. Here we
demonstrate that {OR83b} heterodimerizes with conventional {ORs} early in the endomembrane system in {OSNs}, couples
these complexes to the conserved ciliary trafficking pathway, and is essential to maintain the {OR}/{OR83b} complex
within the sensory cilia, where odor signal transduction occurs. The {OR}/{OR83b} complex is necessary and sufficient to
promote functional reconstitution of odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons that normally respond only to carbon
dioxide. Unexpectedly, unlike all known vertebrate and nematode chemosensory receptors, we find that Drosophila {ORs}
and {OR83b} adopt a novel membrane topology with their N-termini and the most 
conserved loops in the cytoplasm. These loops mediate direct association of {ORs} with {OR83b}. Our results reveal that
{OR83b} is a universal and integral part of the functional {OR} in Drosophila . This atypical heteromeric and

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Roche 454 pyrosequencing has become a method of choice for generating transcriptome data
from non-model organisms. Once the tens to hundreds of thousands of short (250-450 base) reads have been produced, it is
important to correctly assemble these to estimate the sequence of all the transcripts. Most transcriptome assembly
projects use only one program for assembling 454 pyrosequencing reads, but there is no evidence that the programs used
to date are optimal. We have carried out a systematic comparison of five assemblers ({CAP3}, {MIRA}, Newbler, {SeqMan}
and {CLC}) to establish best practices for transcriptome assemblies, using a new dataset from the parasitic nematode
Litomosoides {sigmodontis.RESULTS}:Although no single assembler performed best on all our criteria, Newbler 2.5 gave
longer contigs, better alignments to some reference sequences, and was fast and easy to use. {SeqMan} assemblies
performed best on the criterion of recapitulating known transcripts, and had more 
novel sequence than the other assemblers, but generated an excess of small, redundant contigs. The remaining assemblers
all performed almost as well, with the exception of Newbler 2.3 (the version currently used by most assembly projects),
which generated assemblies that had significantly lower total length. As different assemblers use different underlying
algorithms to generate contigs, we also explored merging of assemblies and found that the merged datasets not only
aligned better to reference sequences than individual assemblies, but were also more consistent in the number and size
of {contigs.CONCLUSIONS}:Transcriptome assemblies are smaller than genome assemblies and thus should be more
computationally tractable, but are often harder because individual contigs can have highly variable read coverage.
Comparing single assemblers, Newbler 2.5 performed best on our trial data set, but other assemblers were closely
comparable. Combining differently optimal assemblies from different programs however gave a 
more credible final product, and this strategy is recommended.},

    abstract = {Male moths are endowed with odorant receptors ({ORs}) to detect species-specific sex pheromones with
remarkable sensitivity and selectivity. We serendipitously discovered that an endogenous {OR} in the fruit fly,
Drosophila melanogaster, is highly sensitive to the sex pheromone of the silkworm moth, bombykol. Intriguingly, the
fruit fly detectors are more sensitive than the receptors of the silkworm moth, although its ecological significance is
unknown. By expression in the  ‚Äù empty neuron‚Äù system, we identified the fruit fly bombykol-sensitive {OR} as {DmelOR7a}
(= {DmOR7a}). The profiles of this receptor in response to bombykol in the native sensilla (ab4) or expressed in the
empty neuron system (ab3 sensilla) are indistinguishable. Both {WT} and transgenic flies responded with high
sensitivity, in a dose-dependent manner, and with rapid signal termination. In contrast, the same empty neuron
expressing the moth bombykol receptor, {BmorOR1}, demonstrated low sensitivity and slow signal 
inactivation. When expressed in the trichoid sensilla T1 of the fruit fly, the neuron housing {BmorOR1} responded with
sensitivity comparable to that of the native trichoid sensilla in the silkworm moth. By challenging the native bombykol
receptor in the fruit fly with high doses of another odorant to which the receptor responds with the highest
sensitivity, we demonstrate that slow signal termination is induced by overdose of a stimulus. As opposed to the empty
neuron system in the basiconic sensilla, the structural, biochemical, and/or biophysical features of the sensilla make
the T1 trichoid system of the fly a better surrogate for the moth receptor.},

    abstract = {Odorant receptors comprise a unique family of G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors both in
mammals and insects. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, all 61 candidate odorant receptor genes have been
identified based on the complete genome sequence, and their expression patterns have been examined. A given odorant
receptor is expressed in the antenna or maxillary palp, or not expressed at all. Here we have applied a set of
statistical analyses to the length of the extra- and intracellular loops and terminals ({LTs}) of Drosophila odorant
receptors to examine possible inter- and intramolecular relations at the population level. We have first provided some
useful statistical information such as mean length values and length histograms to depict a general nature of Drosophila
odorant receptors at the population level, after focusing on discrepancy on assigning transmembrane domains between
researchers. In a preferable transmembrane assignment, all extracellular {LTs}, especially 
the second extracellular loops, were relatively large in length, suggesting their functional significance. Somewhat
surprisingly, principle component analysis ({PCA}) indicated that the maxillary palp receptors were almost as diverse as
the antenna receptors despite their much smaller population size. {PCA} together with histograms also revealed that
receptors with an abnormal length configuration tended not to be expressed, suggesting that {LT} length deviations are
related to transcriptional silencing of odorant receptor genes. Rank transformation tests pointed out possible {LTs}
that could have different length between differently expressed receptors at the population level. Taken together, length
analyses provide us with a general picture, i.e.  ‚Äù length configuration,‚Äù of Drosophila odorant receptors at the

@article{citeulike:8484507,
    abstract = { In 1999, three groups independently identified a large family of candidate Drosophila odorant receptor
genes ([2, 3 and 5]). These genes encode novel seven transmembrane domain receptor proteins that are selectively
expressed in subsets of olfactory receptor neurons in the fruit fly. A total of 19 candidate odorant receptors were
described in the initial reports, and these were named according to three different nomenclature systems, resulting in
multiple names for a given receptor. With the recent completion of the euchromatic genome sequence of Drosophila ([1 and
4]), the number of identified genes with homology to the candidate odorant receptors has increased to a total of 60.
These have been annotated by Celera Genomics in collaboration with the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project using a fourth
nomenclature system. To address this nomenclature problem, representatives of several laboratories met at the
Association for Chemoreception Sciences meeting held in Sarasota, Florida, in April, 
2000. Subsequently, representatives of {FlyBase} were consulted for their assistance in unifying the nomenclature. As a
result of these discussions, a Drosophila Odorant Receptor Nomenclature Committee was formed to systematize and unify
the Drosophila odorant receptor nomenclature. Table 1 presents a summary of the proposed nomenclature, which has
recently been endorsed by a number of scientists working in the field. Rationale of the {SystemGenes} in Drosophila are
typically named to convey functional information, usually reflecting a mutant phenotype. When mutants are not available,
the gene name instead often conveys information about chromosomal position. The Drosophila genome has been divided into
102 numbered segments, based on characteristic banding patterns visible on polytene chromosomes. The cytogenetic
positions of the 60 odorant receptors have been inferred by linkage to known mapped genes, but have not been precisely
determined. Recognizing this inherent uncertainty, yet desiring to convey 
positional information in the unified nomenclature, the Committee proposes that each Drosophila odorant receptor be
named according to its location within the primary numbered cytogenetic units. Where there is only one candidate
receptor within a given numbered region, it is appended with the small letter  ‚Äù a.‚Äù In cases where there are multiple
receptors within a numbered region, these are supplied with a small letter as a unique identifier according to relative
position on the cytogenetic map. For instance, the two odorant receptors in division 43 on the second chromosome are
named Or43a and Or43b, corresponding to map positions {43A1} and {43F5}, respectively. In accordance with nomenclature
standards developed by {FlyBase}, the letter  ‚Äù D‚Äù for Drosophila has been eliminated from the name and the generic
symbol  ‚Äù Or,‚Äù for odorant receptor substituted. The benefit of this naming scheme is that general cytogenetic
information is conveyed, thereby localizing receptors to within approximately 1\% of the 
genome. The omission of more specific number and letter subdivisions in the nomenclature insulates the new names from
readjustments of cytological positions of Drosophila genes that will undoubtedly occur as more accurate alignments
between the cytogenetic map and genomic sequence are {made.Naming} New {SequencesA} total of 60 Drosophila odorant
receptors have been identified and named by members of the Committee. In the eventuality that additional genes are
discovered, these should be named according to the scheme described above. Where possible, the assistance of {FlyBase}
(flybase-help@morgan.harvard.edu) should be sought. Additional information on the odorant receptors in the fly genome is
available at web sites maintained by {FlyBase} (http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu), the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project
(http://www.fruitfly.org), and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). We
recommend that this nomenclature be used in future publications. },

    abstract = {For most organisms, chemosensation is critical for survival and is mediated by large families of
chemoreceptor proteins, whose expression must be tuned appropriately to changes in the chemical environment. We asked
whether expression of chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the genome would be regulated independently; whether
expression of certain chemoreceptor genes would be especially sensitive to environmental changes; whether groups of
chemoreceptor genes undergo coordinated rexpression; and how plastic the expression of chemoreceptor genes is with
regard to sex, development, reproductive state, and social context. To answer these questions we used Drosophila
melanogaster , because its chemosensory systems are well characterized and both the genotype and environment can be
controlled precisely. Using customized {cDNA} microarrays, we showed that chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the
genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and 
between sexes. Expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social
interactions. Furthermore, exposure of flies only to odor of the opposite sex results in altered transcript abundance of
chemoreceptor genes. These genes are distinct from those that show transcriptional plasticity when flies are allowed
physical contact with same or opposite sex members. We analyzed covariance in transcript abundance of chemosensory genes
across all environmental conditions and found that they segregated into 20 relatively small, biologically relevant
modules of highly correlated transcripts. This finely pixilated modular organization of the chemosensory subgenome
enables fine tuning of the expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to ecologically relevant environmental
and physiological conditions.},

    abstract = {We identified a large family of putative odorant-binding protein ({OBP}) genes in the genome of
Drosophila melanogaster. Some of these genes are present in large clusters in the genome. Most members are expressed in
various taste organs, including gustatory sensilla in the labellum, the pharyngeal labral sense organ, dorsal and
ventral cibarial organs, as well as taste bristles located on the wings and tarsi. Some of the gustatory {OBPs} are
expressed exclusively in taste organs, but most are expressed in both olfactory and gustatory sensilla. Multiple binding
proteins can be coexpressed in the same gustatory sensillum. Cells in the tarsi that express {OBPs} are required for
normal chemosensation mediated through the leg, as ablation of these cells dramatically reduces the sensitivity of the
proboscis extension reflex to sucrose. Finally, we show that {OBP} genes expressed in the pharyngeal taste sensilla are
still expressed in the poxneuro genetic background while {OBPs} expressed in the 
labellum are not. These findings support a broad role for members of the {OBP} family in gustation and olfaction and
suggest that poxneuro is required for cell fate determination of labellar but not pharyngeal taste organs.},

    abstract = {Olfaction is of considerable importance to many insects in behaviors critical for survival and
reproduction, including location of food sources, selection of mates, recognition of colony con-specifics, and
determination of oviposition sites. An ubiquitous, but poorly understood, component of the insect's olfactory system is
a group of odorant-binding proteins ({OBPs}) that are present at high concentrations in the aqueous lymph surrounding
the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons. {OBPs} are believed to shuttle odorants from the environment to the
underlying odorant receptors, for which they could potentially serve as odorant presenters. Here we show that the
Drosophila genome carries 51 potential {OBP} genes, a number comparable to that of its odorant-receptor genes. We find
that the majority (73\%) of these {OBP}-like genes occur in clusters of as many as nine genes, in contrast to what has
been observed for the Drosophila odorant-receptor genes. Two of the presumptive {OBP} gene 
clusters each carries an odorant-receptor gene. We also report an intriguing subfamily of 12 putative {OBPs} that share
a unique C-terminal structure with three conserved cysteines and a conserved proline. Members of this subfamily have not
previously been described for any insect. We have performed phylogenetic analyses of the {OBP}-related proteins in
Drosophila as well as other insects, and we discuss the duplication and divergence of the genes for this large family.

    abstract = {Candidate olfactory receptors of the moth Heliothis virescens were found to be extremely diverse from
receptors of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, but there is one exception. The
moth receptor type {HR2} shares a rather high degree of sequence identity with one olfactory receptor type both from
Drosophila (Dor83b) and from Anopheles ({AgamGPRor7}); moreover, in contrast to all other receptors, this unique
receptor type is expressed in numerous antennal neurons. Here we describe the identification of {HR2} homologues in two
further lepidopteran species, the moths Antheraea pernyi and Bombyx mori, which share 86‚Äì88\% of their amino acids. In
addition, based on {RT}-{PCR} experiments {HR2} homologues were discovered in antennal {cDNA} of the honey bee (Apis
mellifera; Hymenoptera), the blowfly (Calliphora erythrocephala; Diptera) and the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor;
Coleoptera). Comparison of all {HR2}-related receptors revealed a high degree of sequence 
conservation across insect orders. In situ hybridization of antennal sections from the bee and the blowfly support the
notion that {HR2}-related receptors are generally expressed in a very large number of antennal cells. This, together
with the high degree of conservation suggests that this unique receptor subtype may fulfill a special function in
chemosensory neurons of insects.},

Specifically, we analyze six Open Source as well as two Closed Source projects and show that process data quality and

    abstract = {Abstract Insect odorant receptors are a large family of seven transmembrane proteins believed to be
G-protein coupled receptors. The peptide sequences of two odorant receptors within a given species may share as little
as 17\% identity, and there is limited similarity between receptors of divergent species. One exception is {DmOr83b},
which is found in Drosophila melanogaster and is highly conserved in at least ten other insect species. {DmOr83b} is
broadly expressed in most of the olfactory sensory neurons of D. melanogaster at most developmental stages, while other
odorant receptors tend to have more restricted and specific expression patterns. {DmOr83b} is critical for D.
melanogaster olfaction, and it is involved in properly localizing other odorant receptors possibly by forming
heterodimers with these receptors. The C-terminal region has been implicated as sites for such heterodimer formation.
Multiple em for motif elicitation ({MEME}), a hidden markov model based program, was used to 
uncover three conserved motifs in the C-termini of a vast majority of the odorant receptor peptides from Anopheles
gambiae, D. melanogaster, and Apis mellifera. These motifs are also found in {DmOr83b} and its orthologs and the order
of these motifs is conserved as well. The conservation of these motifs among divergent odorant receptors in divergent
species suggests functional importance. We propose that these motifs are involved in receptor- receptor protein
interactions, contributing to the heterodimer formation between {DmOr83b} (or its orthologs) and other odorant
receptors.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The olfactory system plays an important role in the recognition of leaf volatiles during
the search of folivore insects for a suitable plant host. For example, volatiles emitted by mulberry leaves trigger
chemotaxis behavior in the silkworms Bombyx mori, and as a consequence, they preferentially reside on and consume
mulberry leaves. Here, we aimed to identify natural chemoattractants and their corresponding olfactory receptors (Ors)
involved in silkworm behavior to mulberry leaves. {RESULTS}: Chemotaxis behavioral assays for headspace volatiles
detected by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that among the volatiles that were emitted by
mulberry leaves, cis-jasmone was the most potent attractant for silkworms, working at a threshold of 0.3 pg from a 20 cm
distance. Among a total of 66 Ors identified in the B. mori genome, we found that 23 were expressed in the olfactory
organs during larval stages. Functional analysis of all the larvae-expressed Ors in 
Xenopus oocytes revealed that one Or, termed {BmOr}-56, showed a high sensitivity to cis-jasmone. In addition, the
ligand-receptor activity of {BmOr}-56 reflected the chemotaxis behavioral response of silkworms. {CONCLUSIONS}: We
identified cis-jasmone as a potent attractant in mulberry leaves for silkworms and provide evidence that a highly tuned
receptor, {BmOr}-56, may mediate this behavioral attraction. The current study sheds light on the mechanism of the
correlation between olfactory perception in folivore insects and chemotaxis behavior to a natural volatile emitted by
green leaves.},

    abstract = {Abstract Olfaction plays an important role in the life history of insects, including key behaviours such
as host selection, oviposition and mate recognition. Odour perception by insects is primarily mediated by the large
diverse family of odourant receptors (Ors) that are expressed on the dendrites of olfactory neurones housed within
chemosensilla. However, few Or sequences have been identified from the Lepidoptera, an insect order that includes some
of the most important pest species worldwide. We have identified 41 Or gene sequences from the silkworm (Bombyx mori)
genome, more than double the number of published Or sequences from the Lepidoptera. Many silkworm Ors appear to be
orthologs of the 17 published tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) Ors indicating that many Or lineages may be
conserved within the Lepidoptera. The majority of the Or genes are expressed in adult female and male antennae
(determined by quantitative real-time {PCR} analysis), supporting their probable roles in adult 
olfaction. Several Or genes are expressed at high levels in both male and female antennae, suggesting they mediate the
perception of common host or conspecific volatiles important to both sexes. {BmOrs} 45‚Äì47 group together in the same
phylogenetic branch and all three are expressed at moderate female-biased ratios, six to eight times higher in female
compared to male moth antennae. Interestingly, {BmOrs19} and 30 appear to be expressed predominantly in female antennae,
opposite to that of the published silkworm pheromone receptors {BmOrs} 1 and 3 that are specific to male antennae. These
results suggest that {BmOr19} and 30 may detect odours critical to female behaviour, such as oviposition cues or
male-produced courtship pheromones.},

    abstract = {The honey bee genome sequence reveals a remarkable expansion of the insect odorant receptor (Or) family
relative to the repertoires of the flies Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, which have 62 and 79 Ors
respectively. A total of 170 Or genes were annotated in the bee, of which seven are pseudogenes. These constitute five
bee-specific subfamilies in an insect Or family tree, one of which has expanded to a total of 157 genes encoding
proteins with 15\%-99 amino acid identity. Most of the Or genes are in tandem arrays, including one with 60 genes. This
bee-specific expansion of the Or repertoire presumably underlies their remarkable olfactory abilities, including
perception of several pheromone blends, kin recognition signals, and diverse floral odors. The number of Apis mellifera
Ors is approximately equal to the number of glomeruli in the bee antennal lobe (160-170), consistent with a general
one-receptor/one-neuron/one-glomerulus relationship. The bee genome encodes just 10 
gustatory receptors (Grs) compared with the D. melanogaster and A. gambiae repertoires of 68 and 76 Grs, respectively. A
lack of Gr gene family expansion primarily accounts for this difference. A nurturing hive environment and a mutualistic
relationship with plants may explain the lack of Gr family expansion. The Or family is the most dramatic example of gene
family expansion in the bee genome, and characterizing their caste- and sex-specific gene expression may provide clues
to their specific roles in detection of pheromone, kin, and floral odors.},

    abstract = {{PMID}: 12627966 The Œ±-factor receptor of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoded by the {STE2} gene
is a member of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}) that mediate multiple signal transduction
pathways. The third intracellular loop of {GPCRs} has been identified as a likely site of interaction with G proteins.
To determine the extent of allowed substitutions within this loop, we subjected a stretch of 21 amino acids
({Leu228‚àíLeu248}) to intensive random mutagenesis and screened multiply substituted alleles for receptor function. The
91 partially functional mutant alleles that were recovered contained 96 unique amino acid substitutions. Every position
in this region can be replaced with at least two other types of amino acids without a significant effect on function.
The tolerance for nonconservative substitutions indicates that activation of the G protein by ligand-bound receptors
involves multiple intramolecular interactions that do not strongly depend on particular 
sequence elements. Many of the functional mutant alleles exhibit greater than normal levels of signaling, consistent
with an inhibitory role for the third intracellular loop. Removal of increasing numbers of positively charged residues
from the loop by site-directed mutagenesis causes a progressive loss of signaling function, indicating that the overall
net charge of the loop is important for receptor function. Introduction of negatively charged residues also leads to a
reduced level of signaling. The defects in signaling caused by substitution of charged amino acids are not caused by
changes in the abundance of receptors at the cell surface.},

    abstract = {{PMID}: 15667221 The Œ±-factor receptor (Ste2p) stimulates mating of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Ste2p belongs to the large family of G protein-coupled receptors that are characterized by seven transmembrane
Œ±-helices. Receptor activation is thought to involve changes in the packing of the transmembrane helix bundle. To
identify residues that contribute to Ste2p activation, second-site suppressor mutations were isolated that restored
function to defective receptors carrying either an {F204S} or {Y266C} substitution which affect residues at the
extracellular ends of transmembrane domains 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-five different suppressor mutations were
identified. On their own, these mutations caused a range of phenotypes, including hypersensitivity, constitutive
activity, altered ligand binding, and loss of function. The majority of the mutations affected residues in the
transmembrane segments that are predicted to face the helix bundle. Many of the suppressor mutations caused 
constitutive receptor activity, suggesting they improved receptor function by partially restoring the balance between
the active and inactive states. Analysis of mutations in transmembrane domain 7 implicated residues Ala281 and Thr282 in
receptor activation. The {A281T} and {T282A} mutants were supersensitive to S. cerevisiae Œ±-factor, but were defective
in responding to a variant of Œ±-factor produced by another species, Saccharomyces kluyveri. The {A281T} mutant also
displayed 8.7-fold enhanced basal signaling. Interestingly, Ala281 and Thr282 are situated in approximately the same
position as Lys296 in rhodopsin, which is covalently linked to retinal. These results suggest that transmembrane domain
7 plays a role in receptor activation in a wide range of G protein-coupled receptors from yeast to humans.},

with no significant homology. We present a detailed structure‚àífunction comparison of the very divergent Class A and D
receptors to address whether there is a common activation mechanism across the {GPCR} superfamily. The Class A and D
receptors are represented by the vertebrate visual pigment rhodopsin and the yeast Œ±-factor pheromone receptor Ste2,

function were located in the structures of rhodopsin and Ste2 to assess whether there are functionally equivalent
positions or regions within these receptors. We find several general similarities that are quite striking. First,
strongly polar amino acids mediate helix interactions. Their mutation generally leads 
to loss of function or constitutive activity. Second, small and weakly polar amino acids facilitate tight helix packing.
Third, proline is essential at similar positions in transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of both receptors. Mapping the
specific location of the conserved amino acids and sites of constitutively active mutations identified conserved
microdomains on transmembrane helices H3, H6, and H7, suggesting that there are underlying similarities in the mechanism

    abstract = {Olfactory stimulation induces an odor-guided crawling behavior of Drosophila melanogaster larvae
characterized by either an attractive or a repellent reaction. In order to understand the underlying processes leading
to these orientations we stimulated single olfactory receptor neurons ({ORNs}) through photo-activation within an intact
neuronal network. Using the {Gal4-UAS} system two light inducible proteins, the light-sensitive cation channel
channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}-2) or the light-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (Pacalpha) were expressed in all or in individual
{ORNs} of the larval olfactory system. Blue light stimulation caused an activation of these neurons, ultimately
producing the illusion of an odor stimulus. Larvae were tested in a phototaxis assay for their orientation toward or
away from the light source. Here we show that activation of Pacalpha expressing {ORNs} bearing the receptors Or33b or
Or45a in blind {norpA} mutant larvae induces a repellent behavior away from the light. 
Conversely, photo-activation of the majority of {ORNs} induces attraction towards the light. Interestingly, in wild type
larvae two ligands of Or33b and Or45a, octyl acetate and propionic ethylester, respectively, have been found to cause an
escape reaction. Therefore, we combined light and odor stimulation to analyze the function of Or33b and Or45a expressing
{ORNs}. We show that the larval olfactory system contains a designated neuronal pathway for repellent odorants and that
activation of a specific class of {ORNs} already determines olfactory avoidance behavior.},

evolution and their expansion in the vertebrate genomes was the subject of many studies. In this paper we apply a
motif-based approach to this problem in order to uncover evolutionary {characteristics.RESULTS}:We extract deterministic
motifs from {ORs} belonging to ten species using the {MEX} (Motif Extraction) algorithm, thus defining Common Peptides
({CPs}) characteristic to {ORs}. We identify species-specific {CPs} and show that their relative abundance is high only
in fish and frog, suggesting relevance to water-soluble odorants. We estimate the origins of {CPs} according to the tree
of life and track the gains and losses of {CPs} through evolution. We identify major {CP} gain in tetrapods and major
losses in reptiles. Although the number of human {ORs} is less than half of the number of {ORs} in other mammals, the
fraction of lost {CPs} is only {11\%.By} examining the positions of {CPs} along 
the {OR} sequence, we find two regions that expanded only in tetrapods. Using {CPs} we are able to establish remote
homology relations between {ORs} and {non-OR} {GPCRs}.Selecting {CPs} according to their evolutionary age, we bicluster
{ORs} and {CPs} for each species. Clean biclustering emerges when using relatively novel {CPs}. Evolutionary age is used
to track the history of {CP} acquisition in the collection of mammalian {OR} families within {HORDE} (Human Olfactory
Receptor Data {Explorer).CONCLUSION}:The {CP} method provides a novel perspective that reveals interesting traits in the
evolution of olfactory receptors. It is consistent with previous knowledge, and provides finer details. Using available
phylogenetic trees, evolution can be rephrased in terms of {CP} {origins.Supplementary} information is also available at

    abstract = {The main goal of the motif finding problem is to detect novel, over-represented unknown signals in a set
of sequences (e.g. transcription factor binding sites in a genome). The most widely used algorithms for finding motifs
obtain a generative probabilistic representation of these over-represented signals and try to discover profiles that
maximize the information content score. Although these profiles form a very powerful representation of the signals, the
major difficulty arises from the fact that the best motif corresponds to the global maximum of a non-convex continuous
function. Popular algorithms like Expectation Maximization ({EM}) and Gibbs sampling tend to be very sensitive to the
initial guesses and are known to converge to the nearest local maximum very quickly. In order to improve the quality of
the results, {EM} is used with multiple random starts or any other powerful stochastic global methods that might yield
promising initial guesses (like projection algorithms). Global methods 
do not necessarily give initial guesses in the convergence region of the best local maximum but rather suggest that a
promising solution is in the neighborhood region. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization framework that
searches the neighborhood regions of the initial alignment in a systematic manner to explore the multiple local optimal
solutions. This effective search is achieved by transforming the original optimization problem into its corresponding
dynamical system and estimating the practical stability boundary of the local maximum. Our results show that the
popularly used {EM} algorithm often converges to sub-optimal solutions which can be significantly improved by the
proposed neighborhood profile search. Based on experiments using both synthetic and real datasets, our method
demonstrates significant improvements in the information content scores of the probabilistic models. The proposed method
also gives the flexibility in using different local solvers and global methods depending on 
their suitability for some specific datasets.},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;Accurate} thematic classification is one of the most commonly desired outputs
from remote sensing images. Recent research efforts to improve the reliability and accuracy of image classification have
led to the introduction of the Support Vector Classification ({SVC}) scheme. {SVC} is a new generation of supervised
learning method based on the principle of statistical learning theory, which is designed to decrease uncertainty in the
model structure and the fitness of data. We have presented a comparative analysis of {SVC} with the Maximum Likelihood
Classification ({MLC}) method, which is the most popular conventional supervised classification technique. {SVC} is an
optimization technique in which the classification accuracy heavily relies on identifying the optimal parameters. Using
a case study, we verify a method to obtain these optimal parameters such that {SVC} can be applied efficiently. We use
multispectral and hyperspectral images to develop thematic classes of 
known lithologic units in order to compare the classification accuracy of both the methods. We have varied the training
to testing data proportions to assess the relative robustness and the optimal training sample requirement of both the
methods to achieve comparable levels of accuracy. The results of our study illustrated that {SVC} improved the
classification accuracy, was robust and did not suffer from dimensionality issues such as the Hughes Effect.},

subsequences of a longer time series that are maximally different to all the rest of the time series subsequences. They
thus capture the sense of the most unusual subsequence within a time series. Time series discords have many uses for
data mining, including improving the quality of clustering, data cleaning, summarization, and anomaly detection.
Discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length
of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our
work with a comprehensive set of experiments. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of discords with objective
experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, medicine, surveillance, and industry, and we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our discord discovery algorithm with more than one 
million experiments, on 82 different datasets from diverse domains.},

                In a previous paper, we introduced {MUSCLE}, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein
sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing {MUSCLE} to achieve the highest scores reported to date
on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several
previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new
option, {MUSCLE}-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating
objective functions that align two profiles.
                We compare the speed and accuracy of {MUSCLE} with {CLUSTALW}, Progressive {POA} and the {MAFFT} script
{FFTNS1}, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks:
{BAliBASE}, {PREFAB}, {SABmark} and {SMART}. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy ({MUSCLE} with default
settings), highest speed ({MUSCLE}-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two ({MUSCLE}-prog). We find
{MUSCLE}-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to {CLUSTALW}
in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. {MUSCLE}-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of
average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.
                {MUSCLE} offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with
currently available programs. {MUSCLE} is freely available at http://www.drive5.com/muscle.

    abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp; Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a useful model system to probe the
mechanisms underlying the detection, discrimination, and perception of volatile odorants. The relatively small receptor
repertoire of 62 odorant receptors makes the goal of understanding odor responses from the total receptor repertoire
approachable in this system, and recent work has been directed toward this goal. In addition, new work not only sheds
light but also raises more questions about the initial steps in odor perception in this system. Odorant receptor genes
in Drosophila are predicted to encode seven transmembrane receptors, but surprising data suggest that these receptors
may be inverted in the plasma membrane compared to classical G-protein coupled receptors. Finally, although some
Drosophila odorant receptors are activated directly by odorant molecules, detection of a volatile pheromone, 11-cis
vaccenyl acetate requires an extracellular adapter protein called {LUSH} for activation 
of pheromone sensitive neurons. Because pheromones are used by insects to trigger mating and other behaviors, these
insights may herald new approaches to control behavior in pathogenic and agricultural pest insects.},

@article{citeulike:7349857,
    abstract = {As a recognized discipline, software engineering traces its roots back to the 1968 {NATO} conference
where the term was first used extensively to highlight the need for an engineering approach to the development of
software. In the 30 years since that first  ‚Äù software engineering‚Äù conference, significant attempts have been made to
improve the overall effectiveness of the software development process, and thus reduce the frequency and severity of
software project failures. A major part of this improvement effort has been the attempt to develop quantitative measures
which can be used to more accurately describe and better understand and manage the software development life cycle.
Thus, many software metrics and models have been introduced during this period. In this article, we briefly trace the
history of the development of software metrics and models, and then summarize the current state of the field. For
discussion purposes, this entire development period is then arbitrarily divided into an 
Introductory Period (1971‚Äì1985), Growth Period (1985‚Äì1997) and the Current Period (1997‚Äì?). The development of metrics
during each of these periods is then related to the treatment of software metrics and models in software engineering
curricula during that same period. Our conclusion is that software engineering curricula have indeed reflected the state
of software engineering as the work in software metrics and models has progressed. Furthermore, software engineering
curricula of the future should reflect the relatively mature state that software metrics have attained, by covering the
basic concepts of metrics in appropriate core courses, and more advanced metrics topics in a specialized, elective
metrics course.},

    abstract = {Uncertainty in estimates of survival of dispersing animals is a vexing difficulty in conservation
biology. The current notion is that this uncertainty decreases the usefulness of spatially explicit population models in
particular. We examined this problem by comparing dispersal models of three levels of complexity: (1) an event-based
binomial model that considers only the occurrence of mortality or arrival, (2) a temporally explicit exponential model
that employs mortality and arrival rates, and (3) a spatially explicit gridwalk model that simulates the movement of
animals through an artificial landscape. Each model was fitted to the same set of field data. A first objective of the
paper is to illustrate how the maximum-likelihood method can be used in all three cases to estimate the means and
confidence limits for the relevant model parameters, given a particular set of data on dispersal survival. Using this
framework we show that the structure of the uncertainty for all three models is 
strikingly similar. In fact, the results of our unified approach imply that spatially explicit dispersal models, which
take advantage of information on landscape details, suffer less from uncertainly than do simpler models. Moreover, we
show that the proposed strategy of model development safeguards one from error propagation in these more complex models.
Finally, our approach shows that all models related to animal dispersal, ranging from simple to complex, can be related
in a hierarchical fashion, so that the various approaches to modeling such dispersal can be viewed from a unified
perspective.},

functionally characterize the Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor ({AgOr}) repertoire. We identify receptors that respond
strongly to components of human odour and that may act in the process of human recognition. Some of these receptors are
narrowly tuned, and some salient odorants elicit strong responses from only one or a few receptors, suggesting a central
role for specific transmission channels in human host-seeking behaviour. This analysis of the Anopheles gambiae

odorants are differentially encoded by the two species in ways consistent with their ecological needs. Our analysis of

    abstract = {doi: {10.1515/BOT}.2009.073 Abstract Polar algae have a striking ability to photosynthesize and grow
under very low light and temperatures. In seaweeds, minimum light demands for photosynthetic saturation and compensation
can be as low as 10 and 2¬†Œºmol photons m-2¬†s-1, respectively. For benthic microalgae, these values can be even lower
because of the limited irradiance reaching deep sea floors. The extreme shade adaptation of these organisms sets their
distributional limits at depths close to 40¬†m and enables them to tolerate long periods of extended darkness. In
addition to their capability for efficient photosynthesis at extremely low light levels, polar algae possess metabolic
adaptations to persist at low temperatures, which permit them to complete their life cycles at year-round temperatures
close to {0¬∞C}. Seaweeds with the lowest temperature demands are the species endemic to the Antarctic while Arctic algae
are comparatively less cold-adapted. These adaptive characteristics allow 
benthic marine algae to make high contributions to high latitude coastal primary productivity and energy fluxes,
exceeding or equaling the production of primary producers in more temperate systems. The studies summarized here give
important insights into the major physiological adaptations allowing marine benthic microalgae and seaweeds to colonize
these extreme habitats.},

{high-Arctic} pack-ice zone are still scarce because of logistical constraints. During six expeditions (1994‚Äì2003) to
the Fram Strait area between Greenland and Svalbard in winter, spring, early summer, late summer and autumn, the sub-ice
habitat and fauna below the pack ice (0‚Äì1¬†m depth) were analyzed for seasonal patterns. Both environmental variables
such as ice cover, temperature, salinity and chlorophyll  a  (chl  a ), as well as species composition, abundance and
biomass of the sub-ice fauna showed distinct seasonal dynamics. Most species of the sub-ice fauna were found in early
summer, followed by autumn, spring and late summer; the lowest number occurred in winter. The sub-ice fauna was
dominated by copepod nauplii during all seasons. Next numerous was the small pelagic copepod  Oithona similis,  followed
by occassional swarms of  Pseudocalanus minutus  and  Calanus  spp. Abundances of 
the sympagic fauna in the sub-ice water layer were much lower, with ectinosomatid copepods being usually the most
numerous sympagic group. In the course of the year, total abundances of the sub-ice fauna showed a steep increase from
the earliest sampling dates towards the end of winter/beginning of spring reaching maximum numbers then, and a decrease
to minimum numbers in early summer. A second peak occurred in late summer, followed by a decrease towards autumn. This
significant trend was due to the abundances of copepod nauplii and  Oithona similis . Sympagic species were virtually
absent during winter, and increased significantly in spring and early and late summer. A factor analysis revealed the
variables ice cover and thickness, water temperature and salinity, as well as chl  a  as the major controlling factors
for the seasonal patterns in different groups and species of the sub-ice fauna. Because of the special environmental
conditions in the sub-ice habitat, and the unique species composition 
characterized by small taxa, young stages, and sympagic species, the seasonal dynamics of the Arctic sub-ice fauna
differ substantially from those of the epipelagic zooplankton community in the Arctic Ocean.},

ice conditions in 2001 and 2003 (heavy sea ice) and 2002 and 2004 (light sea ice). Satellite-based observations of
chlorophyll  a , sea ice and sea surface temperature were used together with in situ depth profiles of chlorophyll  a 
fluorescence collected at 24 sampling stations along the south coast of Disko Island (5‚Äì30¬†km offshore) in May 2003 and
2004. Chlorophyll  a  and sea surface temperatures were also obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}: {EOS}-Terra and {AQUA} satellites) between March 2001 and July 2004. Daily {SMMR}/{SSMI} sea
ice data were obtained in the same years. An empirical regional algorithm was 
developed to calibrate ratios of remotely sensed measurements of water leaving radiance with in situ chlorophyll  a 
fluorescence. The optimal integration depth was 0‚Äì4¬†m, explaining between 70\% and 91\% of the variance. The spatial
development of the phytoplankton bloom showed that the southwestern corner of the study area had the earliest and the
largest spring phytoplankton bloom. The eastern part of Disko Bay, influenced by meltwater outflow from the glaciers,
shows no signs of an early phytoplankton bloom and followed the general pattern of an accelerated bloom soon after the
disappearance of sea ice. In all four years the coupling between phytoplankton and sea ice was bounded by average open
water between 50\% and 80\%, likely due to the combined availability of light and stable open water. The daily
incremental growth in both mean chlorophyll  a  density (chlorophyll  a  per volume water, Œºg¬†l ‚àí1 ) and abundance
(density of chlorophyll  a  extrapolated to ice free areas, tons) estimated by linear 
regression (chlorophyll  a  vs. day) between 1 April and 15 May was highest in 2002 and 2004 (light ice years) and
lowest in 2001 and 2003 (heavy ice years). In years with late sea ice retreat the chlorophyll  a  attained only slightly
lower densities than in years with early sea ice retreat. However, the abundance of chlorophyll  a  in light ice years
was considerably larger than in heavy ice years, and there was an obvious effect of more open water for light-induced
stimulation of primary production. This observation demonstrates the importance of estimating chlorophyll  a  abundance
rather than density in sea ice covered areas. This study also presents the first regional calibration of {MODIS}
chlorophyll  a  data for Arctic waters.},

    abstract = {A rise in global temperatures could potentially lead to less ice in the Arctic, including a reduction in
the ice-covered period. The consequence of a changing ice cover on the food web structure and production in Disko Bay,
Western Greenland, is analysed through application of a dynamical model for the planktonic food web. The model is
successfully calibrated and tested for sensitivity, using a detailed data set for 1996‚Äì1997. Model scenarios are (1)
extended ice cover and (2) no ice. These scenarios are compared to model runs with measured ice cover in two normal
years. In the extended ice scenario, assuming unchanged copepod behaviour, copepods are starving or feeding in the
ice/water interface from the time they ascend to the surface layer from over-wintering depths until the ice break-up in
June. The total annual primary production reaches the same level as it does in the average year, but copepod ingestion
and, as a consequence, vertical carbon export is reduced by app. 40\%. In the ice-
free situation, an early diatom bloom is initiated by stratification of the water in March, before the copepods ascend.
The diatom bloom is grazed upon by protozooplankton, which reach a high biomass before the copepods ascend in April.
Annual primary production increases by 52\% while copepod ingestion and vertical loss of carbon is reduced by 57\%. This
study illustrates how a change in the ice cover in Arctic areas can potentially create a mismatch between spring primary
production and copepod grazers. The result may be a planktonic food web dominated by protozooplankton, resulting in
lower export of organic material out of the photic zone despite increased primary productivity, or alternatively lead to
changes in species composition or behaviour.},

@article{citeulike:6655681,
    abstract = {In shelf waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula ({wAP}), with abundant macro- and micronutrients,
water-column stability has been suggested as the main factor controlling primary production; freshwater input from
sea-ice melting stabilizes the upper water column by forming a shallow summer mixed layer. Retreating sea ice in the
spring and summer thus defines the area of influence, the sea-ice zone ({SIZ}) and the marginal ice zone ({MIZ}). A
12-year time series (1995‚Äì2006) was analyzed to address two main questions: (1) what are the spatial and temporal
patterns in primary production; and (2) to what extent and in what ways is primary production related to sea-ice
dynamics. Data were collected on cruises performed during January of each year, at the height of the growth season,
within the region bounded by {64¬∞S} and {64¬∞W} to the north and {68¬∞S} and {66¬∞W} to the south. Average daily integrated
primary production varied by an order of magnitude, from  250 to  1100¬†mg¬†C¬†m ‚àí2 ¬†d ‚àí1 , with 
an average cruise primary production of 745¬†mg¬†C¬†m ‚àí2 ¬†d ‚àí1 . A strong onshore‚Äìoffshore gradient was evident along the
shelf with higher production observed inshore. Inter-annual regional production varied by a factor of 7: maximum rates
were measured in 2006 (1788¬†mg¬†C¬†m ‚àí2 ¬†d ‚àí1 ) and minimum in 1999 (248¬†mg¬†C¬†m ‚àí2 ¬†d ‚àí1 ). The results support the
hypothesis that primary production in the {wAP} shelf is related to sea-ice dynamics. To first order, shallower summer
mixed-layer depths in the shelf correlated with late sea retreat and primary production. Principal component analysis
showed that high primary production in January was associated with enhanced shelf production toward the coast and in the
south, explaining 63\% of the variability in space and time. This first mode captured the inter-annual variability in
regional production. Temporal variability in primary production (time series of anomalies defined for each location)
showed spatial dependence: higher primary production correlated with shallow 
mixed-layer depths only at mid-shelf; in coastal and offshore waters, primary production correlated with deeper mixed
layers. Thus, coastal primary production can show a non-linear relationship with summer mixed layers. Under conditions
of large biomass (>20¬†mg¬†chl  a ¬†m ‚àí3 ) and shallow mixed-layer depth (e.g., 5¬†m) phytoplankton production becomes light
limited. This limitation is reduced with a deepening of the summer mixed layer (e.g., 20¬†m). Dominance of diatoms and
the ability to adapt and photosynthesize at higher light levels characterized the large phytoplankton blooms. No
significant regional trend in primary production was detected within the 12-year series. We conclude that the regional
average primary production on the {wAP} shelf is associated with shallow summer mixed layers in conjunction with late
sea-ice retreat. An opposite relationship is observed for the highest production rates in coastal waters, associated
with large biomass, where a deepening of the summer mixed layer relieves light 
limitation.},

                Whole-genome hybridization studies have suggested that the nuclear genomes of accessions (natural
strains) of Arabidopsis thaliana can differ by several percent of their sequence. To examine this variation, and as a
first step in the 1001 Genomes Project for this species, we produced 15- to 25-fold coverage in Illumina
sequencing-by-synthesis ({SBS}) reads for the reference accession, Col-0, and two divergent strains, Bur-0 and Tsu-1. We
aligned reads to the reference genome sequence to assess data quality metrics and to detect polymorphisms. Alignments
revealed 823,325 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and 79,961 unique 1- to 3-bp indels in the divergent
accessions at a specificity of >99\%, and over 2000 potential errors in the reference genome sequence. We also
identified >3.4 Mb of the Bur-0 and Tsu-1 genomes as being either extremely dissimilar, deleted, or duplicated relative
to the reference genome. To obtain sequences for these regions, we incorporated the Velvet 
assembler into a targeted de novo assembly method. This approach yielded 10,921 high-confidence contigs that were
anchored to flanking sequences and harbored indels as large as 641 bp. Our methods are broadly applicable for
polymorphism discovery in moderate to large genomes even at highly diverged loci, and we established by subsampling the
Illumina {SBS} coverage depth required to inform a broad range of functional and evolutionary studies. Our pipeline for
aligning reads and predicting {SNPs} and indels, {SHORE}, is available for download at http://1001genomes.org.

Because these instruments are new, their data require characterization with respect to accuracy and utility. To address
this, we sequenced a Caernohabditis elegans N2 Bristol strain isolate using the Solexa Sequence Analyzer, and compared
the reads to the reference genome to characterize the data and to evaluate coverage and representation. Massively
parallel sequencing facilitates strain-to-reference comparison for genome-wide sequence variant discovery. Owing to the
short-read-length sequences produced, we developed a revised approach to determine the regions of the genome to which
short reads could be uniquely mapped. We then aligned Solexa reads from C. elegans strain {CB4858} to the reference, and
screened for single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and small indels. This study demonstrates the utility of massively
parallel short read sequencing for whole genome resequencing and for 
accurate discovery of genome-wide polymorphisms.},

One unanswered question is whether such affective forecasting errors are due to participants' poor estimation of their
initial emotional reactions (an  initial intensity bias ), poor estimation of the rate at which these emotional
reactions diminish over time (a  decay bias ), or both. The present research used intensive longitudinal procedures to
explore this question in the wake of an upsetting life event: the dissolution of a romantic relationship. Results
revealed that the affective forecasting error is entirely accounted for by an initial intensity bias, with no
contribution by a decay bias. In addition, several moderators of the affective forecasting error emerged: participants
who were more in love with their partners, who thought it was unlikely they would soon enter a new relationship, and who
played less of a role in initiating the breakup made especially inaccurate forecasts.},

contain these set-valued attributes, and none of them allow the mining of association rules directly from this type of

a number of biological datasets. We describe here our system and highlight its merits by means of comparing the results
achieved with it and the failed attempts to mine association rules from those datasets using standard tools. Our system

    abstract = {"It premieres the most adept researchers in the field who have bravely and
soundly followed mixed methodology approaches."

-{NACADA} (National {ACademic} {ADvising} Association)


In recent years, researchers have begun to combine quantitative and
qualitative approaches within single study research designs. As such, the
literature on mixed methods research has grown at a rapid pace. While more
methodological books addressing mixed methods are becoming available, the
foundational writings of this field are still scattered across diverse
disciplines and their wide range of publications outlets, leaving students and
researchers at a disadvantage to find the exemplary or model studies to help
them understand how to conduct their own mixed methods research.


In light of the dispersed nature of the mixed methods literature, **The Mixed
Methods Reader **editors have organized a collection of key methodological
mixed methods discussions and exemplar mixed methods research studies in one
easy-to-access location. This integrative collection draws from the
international literature appearing across diverse research disciplines over
the past thirty years. **The Mixed Methods Reader **is divided into two parts:
Part I ‚Äì Methodological Selections and Part {II} ‚Äì Exemplar Research Studies.
Part I includes a collection of 14 foundational writings from the mixed
methods research literature. These readings convey the overall development and
evolution of mixed methods research and address essential topics for
researchers new to the field of mixed methods research. These topics include
its foundations; design types; implementation issues such as sampling, data
analysis, and validity; rhetorical devices for reporting mixed methods
studies; and critiques about the current thinking in the field. Part {II}
includes 9 exemplar mixed methods research studies drawn from a range of
disciplines and international scholars. The studies were intentionally
selected to illustrate four major types of mixed methods designs. As with the
methodological chapters,¬†the editors¬†organize the exemplar research studies so
that the reader can see a natural progression of the different approaches to
conducting mixed methods research.


**The Mixed Methods Reader**, edited by two leading researchers in mixed
methods research, offers students and researchers a rich balance of
foundational works and exemplary studies across a range of disciplines.¬†This
reader is an invaluable primary or supplementary resource for courses that
address mixed methods research.


**Key Features**

  * Each of the 14 foundational readings offers a brief introduction by the
editors, discussing the reading's overall importance to mixed methods research
and explaining what aspect of the research process is addressed.

  * The foundational readings are organized around the research process to
facilitate its use as a text or supplement for research courses emphasizing
mixed methods approaches. They cover research design types and purposes, data
collection, data analysis, reporting of mixed methods studies, and future
directions.

  * Each of¬†the 9 exemplary studies include a brief commentary from the
editors, highlighting the noteworthy features of the article. These exemplary
studies range in discipline and setting yet focus intently on the research
process and the various ways of conducting mixed methods studies.

  * Visual diagrams accompany each exemplary study: These visual diagrams will
convey the overall structure and approach used in each of the studies.

  * Discussion questions accompanying each selection further call attention to
the key points and help a student or individual researcher to tie together the
core concepts presented in the commentaries and articles.},

@book{citeulike:447180,
    abstract = {Once again, editors Norman K. Denzin and Yvonna S Lincoln have put together a
volume that represents the state of the art for the theory and practice of
qualitative inquiry. Built on the foundation of the landmark first edition,
published in 1994, the second edition is both the bridge and the roadmap to
the territory that lies ahead for researchers across the disciplines.

The Second Edition is a significant revision; in fact, it is virtually a new
work. It features six new chapter topics, including, among others, auto-
ethnography, critical race theory, applied ethnography, queer theory, and
testimonies. Another fifteen chapters are written by new contributors. And
every chapter in the book has been thoroughly revised and updated.

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, it is necessary to re-engage the
promise of qualitative research as a generative form of inquiry. The Second
Edition of the Handbook reveals how the discourses of qualitative research can
be used to imagine and create a free and democratic society. Ground-breaking,
thought-provoking, comprehensive and featuring the contributions of a virtual
"Who's Who" in the human sciences, Handbook of Qualitative Research, Second
Edition is absolutely an essential text for the library of any scholar
interested in the art and science of research.},

repertoire with designs that include the use of both qualitative and quantitative methods. Such practice, however, needs
to be grounded in a theory that can meaningfully guide the design and implementation of mixed-method evaluations. In
this study, a mixed-method conceptual framework was developed from the theoretical literature and then refined through
an analysis of 57 empirical mixed-method evaluations. Five purposes for mixed-method evaluations are identified in this
conceptual framework: triangulation, complementarity, development, initiation, and expansion. For each of the five
purposes, a recommended design is also presented in terms of seven relevant design characteristics. These design
elements encompass issues about methods, the phenomena under investigation, paradigmatic framework, and criteria for
implementation. In the empirical review, common misuse of the term triangulation was 
apparent in evaluations that stated such a purpose but did not employ an appropriate design. In addition, relatively few
evaluations in this review integrated the different method types at the level of data analysis. Strategies for
integrated data analysis are among the issues identified as priorities for further mixed-method work.},

@phdthesis{csdl2-06-05,
    abstract = {Software development is slow, expensive and error prone, often resulting in products with a large number
of defects which cause serious problems in usability, reliability, and performance. To combat this problem, software
measurement provides a systematic and empirically-guided approach to control and improve software development processes
and final products. However, due to the high cost associated with ``metrics collection'' and difficulties in ``metrics
decision-making,'' measurement is not widely adopted by software organizations. This dissertation proposes a novel
metrics-based program called ``software project telemetry'' to address the problems. It uses software sensors to collect
metrics automatically and unobtrusively. It employs a domain-specific language to represent telemetry trends in software
product and process metrics. Project management and process improvement decisions are made by detecting changes in
telemetry trends and comparing trends between different periods of the 
same project. Software project telemetry avoids many problems inherent in traditional metrics models, such as the need
to accumulate a historical project database and ensure that the historical data remain comparable to current and future
projects. The claim of this dissertation is that software project telemetry provides an effective approach to (1)
automated metrics collection and analysis, and (2) in-process, empirically-guided software development process problem
detection and diagnosis. Two empirical studies were carried out to evaluate the claim: one in software engineering
classes, and the other in the Collaborative Software Development Lab. The results suggested that software project
telemetry had acceptably-low metrics collection and analysis overhead, and that it provided decision-making value at
least in the exploratory context of the two studies.},

    abstract = {Software developers are often faced with modification tasks that involve source which is spread across a
code base. Some dependencies between source code, such as those between source code written in different languages, are
difficult to determine using existing static and dynamic analyses. To augment existing analyses and to help developers
identify relevant source code during a modification task, we have developed an approach that applies data mining
techniques to determine change patterns - sets of files that were changed together frequently in the past - from the
change history of the code base. Our hypothesis is that the change patterns can be used to recommend potentially
relevant source code to a developer performing a modification task. We show that this approach can reveal valuable
dependencies by applying the approach to the Eclipse and Mozilla open source projects and by evaluating the
predictability and interestingness of the recommendations produced for actual modification tasks 
on these systems.},

an approach for mining change patterns in {AspectJ} software evolution. Our approach first decomposes the software
changes into a set of atomic change representations, then employs the apriori data mining algorithm to generate the most

we demonstrate that those change patterns can be used as measurement aid and fault

@phdthesis{citeulike:2703162,
    abstract = {A recent focus of interest in software engineering research is on low-level software processes, which
define how software developers or development teams should carry on development activities in short phases that last
from several minutes to a few hours. Anecdotal evidence exists for the positive impact on quality and productivity of
certain low-level software processes such as test-driven development and continuous integration. However, empirical
research on low-level software processes often yields conflicting results. A significant threat to the validity of the
empirical studies on low-level software processes is that they lack the ability to rigorously assess process
conformance. That is to say, the degree to which developers follow the low-level software processes can not be
evaluated. In order to improve the quality of empirical research on low-level software processes, I developed a
technique called Software Development Stream Analysis ({SDSA}) that can infer development behaviors 
using automatically collected in-process software metrics. The collection of development activities is supported by
Hackystat, a framework for automated software process and product metrics collection and analysis. {SDSA} abstracts the
collected software metrics into a software development stream, a time-series data structure containing time-stamped
development events. It then partitions the development stream into episodes, and then uses a rule-based system to infer
low-level development behaviors exhibited in episodes. With the capabilities provided by Hackystat and {SDSA}, I
developed the Zorro software system to study a specific low-level software process called {Test-Driven} Development
({TDD}). Experience reports have shown that {TDD} can greatly improve software quality with increased developer
productivity, but empirical research findings on {TDD} are often mixed. An inability to rigorously assess process
conformance is a possible explanation. Zorro can rigorously assess process conformance to a 
specific operational definition for {TDD}, and thus enable more controlled, comparable empirical studies. My research
has demonstrated that Zorro can recognize the low-level software development behaviors that characterize {TDD}. Both the
pilot and classroom case studies support this conclusion. The industrial case study shows that the automated data
collection and development behavior inference has the potential to be useful for researchers.},

scientific, and government transactions now computerized, but the widespread use of digital cameras, publication tools,
and bar codes also generate data. On the collection side, scanned text and image platforms, satellite remote sensing
systems, and the World Wide Web have flooded us with a tremendous amount of data. This explosive growth has generated an
even more urgent need for new techniques and automated tools that can help us transform this data into useful
information and knowledge.<br><br>Like the first edition, voted the most popular data mining book by KD Nuggets readers,
this book explores concepts and techniques for the discovery of patterns hidden in large data sets, focusing on issues
relating to their feasibility, usefulness, effectiveness, and scalability. However, since the publication of the first

the concept of pre-large sequences as new records were inserted. In this paper, we attempt to apply the concept of

support threshold and an upper support threshold. They act as buffers to avoid the movements of sequential patterns
directly from large to small and vice-versa. Our proposed algorithm does not  require rescanning original databases
until the accumulative amount of deleted customer sequences exceeds a safety bound, which depends on database size. As
databases grow larger, the numbers of deleted customer sequences allowed before database rescanning  is required also
grow. The proposed approach is thus efficient for a large database.},

ends before state  B starts, the gap is covered by state C\&\#034;. As an example we consider  the problem of deriving
local weather forecasting rules that allow us to  conclude from the qualitative behaviour of the air-pressure curve to
the  wind-strength. Here, the states have been extracted automatically from  (multivariate) time series and characterize
the trend of the time series  locally within the assigned time interval.  1 },

into a state-based representation with arcs labeled with symbols from an alphabet of events (a Transition System, {TS}).
The method is based on the theory of regions for Elementary Transition Systems ({ETS}). Previous work has shown that,
for any {ETS}, there exists a Petri Net with minimum transition count (one transition for each label) with a
reachability graph isomorphic to the original Transition System. Our method extends and implements that theory by using
the following three mechanisms that provide a framework for synthesis of safe Petri nets from arbitrary {TSs}. First,
the requirement of isomorphism is relaxed to bisimulation of {TSs}, thus extending the class of synthesizable {TSs} to a
new class called {Excitation-Closed} Transition Systems ({ECTS}). Second, for the first time, we propose a method of
{PN} synthesis for an arbitrary {TS} based on mapping a {TS} event into a set 
of transition labels in a {PN}. Third, the notion of irredundant region set is exploited, to minimize the number of
places in the net without affecting its behavior. The synthesis method can derive different classes of place-irredundant
Petri Nets (e.g., pure, free choice, unique choice) from the same {TS}, depending on the constraints imposed on the
synthesis algorithm. This method has been implemented and applied in different frameworks. The results obtained from the
experiments have demonstrated the wide applicability of the method},

improve it. A particularly difficult aspect of some behavior is concurrency. Automated techniques which seek to mine
workflow data logs to discover information about the workflows must be able to handle the concurrency that manifests
itself in the workflow executions. This paper presents techniques to discover patterns of concurrent behavior from
traces of workflow events. The techniques are based on a probabilistic analysis of the event traces. Using metrics for
the number, frequency, and regularity of event occurrences, a determination is made of the likely concurrent behavior
being manifested by the system. Discovering this behavior can help a workflow designer better understand and improve the
work processes they are managing.},

    abstract = {The topic of process mining has attracted the attention of both researchers and tool vendors in the
Business Process Management ({BPM}) space. The goal of process mining is to discover process models from event logs,
i.e., events logged by some information system are used to extract information about activities and their causal
relations. Several algorithms have been proposed for process mining. Many of these algorithms cannot deal with
concurrency. Other typical problems are the presence of duplicate activities, hidden activities, non-free-choice
constructs, etc. In addition, real-life logs contain noise (e.g., exceptions or incorrectly logged events) and are
typically incomplete (i.e., the event logs contain only a fragment of all possible behaviors). To tackle these problems
we propose a completely new approach based on genetic algorithms. As can be expected, a genetic approach is able to deal
with noise and incompleteness. However, it is not easy to represent processes properly in a 
genetic setting. In this paper, we show a genetic process mining approach using the so-called causal matrix as a
representation for individuals. We elaborate on the relation between Petri nets and this representation and show that
genetic algorithms can be used to discover Petri net models from event logs. Keywords: Process Mining, Petri Nets,

specified workflow design is required in order to enact a given workflow process. Creating a workflow design is a
complicated time-consuming process and typically, there are discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the

technique uses workflow logs to discover the workflow process as it is actually being executed. The workflow log
contains information about events taking place. We assume that these events are totally ordered and each event refers to
one task being executed for a single case. This information can easily be extracted from transactional information
systems (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning systems such as {SAP} and Baan). The rediscovering technique proposed in
this paper can deal with noise and can also be used to validate workflow processes by 
uncovering and measuring the discrepancies between prescriptive models and actual process executions.},

    abstract = {Abstract¬†¬†Process mining includes the automated discovery of processes from event logs. Based on
observed events (e.g., activities being executed or messages being exchanged) a process model is constructed. One of the
essential problems in process mining is that one cannot assume to have seen all possible behavior. At best, one has seen
a representative subset. Therefore, classical synthesis techniques are not suitable as they aim at finding a model that
is able to exactly reproduce the log. Existing process mining techniques try to avoid such  ‚Äù overfitting‚Äù by
generalizing the model to allow for more behavior. This generalization is often driven by the representation language
and very crude assumptions about completeness. As a result, parts of the model are  ‚Äù overfitting‚Äù (allow only for what
has actually been observed) while other parts may be  ‚Äù underfitting‚Äù (allow for much more behavior without strong
support for it). None of the existing techniques enables the user to control the 
balance between  ‚Äù overfitting‚Äù and  ‚Äù underfitting‚Äù. To address this, we propose a two-step approach. First, using a
configurable approach, a transition system is constructed. Then, using the  ‚Äù theory of regions‚Äù, the model is
synthesized. The approach has been implemented in the context of {ProM} and overcomes many of the limitations of
traditional approaches.},

issues by proposing a novel method to classify software behaviors based on past history or runs. With the technique, it
is possible to generalize past known errors and mistakes to capture failures and anomalies. Our technique first mines a
set of discriminative features capturing repetitive series of events from program execution traces. It then performs
feature selection to select the best features for classification. These features are then used to train a classifier to
detect failures. Experiments and case studies on traces of several benchmark software systems and a real-life
concurrency bug from {MySQL} server show the utility of the technique in 
capturing failures and anomalies. On average, our pattern-based classification technique outperforms the baseline
approach by 24.68\% in accuracy.},

This presents a practical barrier to the adoption of process technologies, which would be lowered by automated
assistance in creating formal models. To this end, we have developed a data analysis technique that we term process
discovery. Under this technique, data describing process events are first captured from an on-going process and then
used to generate a formal model of the behavior of that process. In this article we describe a Markov method that we
developed specifically for process discovery, as well as describe two additional methods that we   adopted from other
domains and augmented for our purposes. The three methods range from the purely algorithmic to the purely statistical.

infrastructure from scratch or test their techniques in an isolated way, 
disconnected from any practical applications. To overcome these kind of problems, we have developed the {ProM}

    abstract = {Mining knowledge about ordering from sequence data is an important problem with many applications, such
as bioinformatics, Web mining, network management, and intrusion detection. For example, if many customers follow a
partial order in their purchases of a series of products, the partial order can be used to predict other related
customers' future purchases and develop marketing campaigns. Moreover, some biological sequences (e.g., microarray data)
can be clustered based on the partial orders shared by the sequences. Given a set of items, a total order of a subset of
items can be represented as a string. A string database is a multiset of strings. In this paper, we identify a novel
problem of mining frequent closed partial orders from strings. Frequent closed partial orders capture the nonredundant
and interesting ordering information from string databases. Importantly, mining frequent closed partial orders can
discover meaningful knowledge that cannot be disclosed by previous data mining 
techniques. However, the problem of mining frequent closed partial orders is challenging. To tackle the problem, we
develop Frecpo (for Frequent closed partial order), a practically efficient algorithm for mining the complete set of
frequent closed partial orders from large string databases. Several interesting pruning techniques are devised to speed
up the search. We report an extensive performance study on both real data sets and synthetic data sets to illustrate the
effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach.},

Depending on the exact problem formulation, this may be a very complicated problem. Existing methods typically make
strong simplifying assumptions about the form of the rules, and limit the measure of rule quality to simple properties,
such as confidence. Because confidence in itself is not a good indicator of how interesting a rule is to the user, the
mined rules are typically sorted according to some secondary interestingness measure. In this paper we present a rule
mining method that is based on genetic programming. Because we use specialized pattern matching hardware to evaluate
each rule, our method supports a very wide range of rule formats, and can use any reasonable fitness measure. We develop
a fitness measure that is well-suited for our method, and give empirical results of applying the method to synthetic and

Both the original implementation and the inevitable subsequent evolution (maintenance) are a continual learning
experience driven, inter alia, by feedback from the results of the behaviour under execution of the software, as
perceived by various stakeholders, by advances and growth in the user organisations and by adaptation to changes in the
external world, both independent and as a result of installation and use of the software. Real world, termed {type-E},
software is essentially evolutionary in nature. The study of the processes of evolution of such software is of
considerable interest, as is that of the domains that co-evolve with the software. After briefly discussing the meaning
of the term evolution in the context of software, its technology, the software process and related domains, this paper
describes some of the facets

using a trie with K levels. The {O(K} 2 n) breadth-first ({BF}) algorithm inserts a pattern into the trie at level k
only if level k-1 has been completed. The {O(Kn}) depth-first ({DF}) algorithm inserts a pattern and all its prefixes
into the trie before examining another pattern. A threshold is used to store only frequent subsequences. Since {DF}
cannot apply the threshold until the trie is complete, it makes poor use of memory. The heuristic depth-first ({HDF})
algorithm, a variant of {DF}, uses the threshold in the same manner as {BF}. {HDF} gains efficiency but loses a
predictable amount of accuracy.},

    abstract = {In the last years, the completion of the human genome sequencing showed up a wide range of new
challenging issues involving raw data analysis. In particular, the discovery of information implicitly encoded in
biological sequences is assuming a prominent role in identifying genetic diseases and in deciphering biological
mechanisms. This information is usually represented by patterns frequently occurring in the sequences. Because of
biological observations, a specific class of patterns is becoming particularly interesting: frequent structured
patterns. In this respect, it is biologically meaningful to look at both  ‚Äù exact‚Äù and  ‚Äù approximate‚Äù repetitions of
the patterns within the available sequences. This paper gives a contribution in this setting by providing some
algorithms which allow to discover frequent structured patterns, either in  ‚Äù exact‚Äù or  ‚Äù approximate‚Äù form, present in
a collection of input biological sequences.},

bioinformatics. Accessible to students in both biology and computer science, it strikes a unique balance between
rigorous mathematics and practical techniques, emphasizing the ideas underlying algorithms rather than offering a
collection of apparently unrelated problems.<br /> <br /> The book introduces biological and algorithmic ideas together,
linking issues in computer science to biology and thus capturing the interest of students in both subjects. It
demonstrates that relatively few design techniques can be used to solve a large number of practical problems in biology,
and presents this material intuitively.<br /> <br /> <i>An Introduction to Bioinformatics Algorithms</i> is one of the
first books on bioinformatics that can be used by students at an undergraduate level. It includes a dual table of
contents, organized by algorithmic idea and biological idea; discussions of biologically 
relevant problems, including a detailed problem formulation and one or more solutions for each; and brief biographical
sketches of leading figures in the field. These interesting vignettes offer students a glimpse of the inspirations and
motivations for real work in bioinformatics, making the concepts presented in the text more concrete and the techniques
more approachable.<br /> <br /> PowerPoint presentations, practical bioinformatics problems, sample code, diagrams,

relationships in multivariate data, called Time Series Knowledge Mining ({TSKM}). We define the Time Series Knowledge
Representation ({TSKR}) as a new language for expressing temporal knowledge in time interval data. The patterns have a
hierarchical structure, with levels corresponding to the temporal concepts duration, coincidence, and partial order. The
patterns are very compact, but offer details for each element on demand. In comparison with related approaches, the
{TSKR} is shown to have advantages in robustness, expressivity, and comprehensibility. The search for coincidence and
partial order in interval data can be formulated as instances of the well known frequent itemset problem. Efficient
algorithms for the discovery of the patterns are adapted accordingly. A novel form of search space pruning effectively
reduces the size of the mining result to ease interpretation and speed up the 
algorithms. Human interaction is used during the mining to analyze and validate partial results as early as possible and
guide further processing steps. The efficacy of the methods is demonstrated using two real life data sets. In an
application to sports medicine the results were recognized as valid and useful by an expert of the field.},

    abstract = {The class hierarchy is an important aspect of object-oriented software development. Design and
maintenance of such a hierarchy is a difficult task that is often accomplished without any clear guidance or tool
support. Formal concept analysis provides a natural theoretical framework for this problem because it can guarantee
maximal factorization while preserving specialization relationships. The framework can be useful for several software
development scenarios within the class hierarchy life-cycle such as design from scratch using a set of class
specifications, or a set of object examples, refactoring/reengineering from existing object code or from the observation
of the actual use of the classes in applications and hierarchy evolution by incrementally adding new classes. The
framework can take into account different levels of specification details and suggests a number of well-defined
alternative designs. These alternatives can be viewed as normal forms for class hierarchies where each 
normal form addresses particular design goals. An overview of work in the area is presented by highlighting the formal
concept analysis notions that are involved. One particularly difficult problem arises when taking associations between
classes into account. Basic scaling has to be extended because the scales used for building the concept lattice are
dependent on it. An approach is needed to treat this circularity in a well-defined manner. Possible solutions are
discussed.},

    abstract = {Periodicy detection in time series data is a challenging problem of great importance in many
applications. Most previous work focused on mining synchronous periodic patterns and did not recognize the misaligned
presence of a pattern due to the intervention of random noise. In this paper, we propose a more flexible model of
asynchronous periodic pattern that may be present only within a subsequence and whose occurrences may be shifted due to
disturbance. Two parameters min\&\#095;rep and max\&\#095;dis are employed to specify the minimum number of repetitions
that is required within each segment of nondisrupted pattern occurrences and the maximum allowed disturbance between any
two successive valid segments. Upon satisfying these two requirements, the longest valid subsequence of a pattern is
returned. A two-phase algorithm is devised to first generate potential periods by distance-based pruning followed by an
iterative procedure to derive and validate candidate patterns and locate the longest 
valid subsequence. We also show that this algorithm cannot only provide linear time complexity with respect to the
length of the sequence but also achieve space efficiency.},

    abstract = {"People sometimes ask me what they should read to find out about artificial
intelligence. Herbert Simon's book The Sciences of the Artificial is always on
the list I give them. Every page issues a challenge to conventional thinking,
and the layman who digests it well will certainly understand what the field of
artificial intelligence hopes to accomplish. I recommend it in the same spirit
that I recommend Freud to people who ask about psychoanalysis, or Piaget to
those who ask about child psychology: If you want to learn about a subject,
start by reading its founding fathers." -- George A. Miller, {\_Complex}
Information Processing\_

Continuing his exploration of the organization of complexity and the science
of design, this new edition of Herbert Simon's classic work on artificial
intelligence adds a chapter that sorts out the current themes and tools --
chaos, adaptive systems, genetic algorithms -- for analyzing complexity and
complex systems. There are updates throughout the book as well. These take
into account important advances in cognitive psychology and the science of
design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical
symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.
The chapter "Economic Reality" has also been revised to reflect a change in
emphasis in Simon's thinking about the respective roles of organizations and
markets in economic systems.},

being executed. Process mining is particularly useful in situations where events are recorded but there is no system

activities are recorded in the hospital information system, but where health-care professionals determine the
"careflow." Many process mining approaches have been proposed in recent years. However, in spite of many researchers'
persistent efforts, there are still several challenging problems to be solved. In this paper, we focus on mining
non-free-choice constructs, i.e., situations where there is a mixture of choice and synchronization. Although most
real-life processes exhibit non-free-choice behavior, existing algorithms are unable to adequately deal with such
constructs. Using a Petri-net-based representation, we will show that there are two kinds of causal 
dependencies between tasks, i.e., explicit and implicit ones. We propose an algorithm that is able to deal with both
kinds of dependencies. The algorithm has been implemented in the {ProM} framework and experimental results shows that
the algorithm indeed significantly improves existing process mining techniques.},

introduce an  extended set of time-wise and object-wise statistical features  including not only the trajectory
coordinates but also  the histograms and {HMM} based representations of object's  speed, orientation, location, size,
and aspect ratio. These  features enable detection of events that cannot be detected  with the existing trajectory
features reported so far. Second,  we introduce a spectral clustering algorithm that can automatically  estimate the
optimal number of clusters. First,  we construct feature-wise affinity matrices from the pair-wise  similarity scores of
objects using the extended set of  features. To determine the usual events, we apply eigen-vector  decomposition and
obtain object clusters. We show  that the number of eigenvectors used in the decomposition is  proportional to the
optimal number of clusters. Unlike the  conventional approaches that try to fit 
predefined models to  events, we analyze the conformity of objects using affinity  matrices to find the unusual events.
We improve the feature  selection process by incorporating feature variances.  We prove that the clustering stage is not
adversely affected  by high dimensionality of data space. Our simulations with  synthetic and real data reveal that the

    abstract = {Consider the problem of monitoring tens of thousands of time series data streams in an online fashion
and making decisions based on them. In addition to single stream statistics such as average and standard deviation, we
also want to find high correlations among all pairs of streams. A stock market trader might use such a tool to spot
arbitrage opportunities. This paper proposes efficient methods for solving this problem based on Discrete Fourier
Transforms and a three level time interval hierarchy. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real world financial
trading data show that our algorithm beats the direct computation approach by several orders of magnitude. It also
improves on previous Fourier Transform approaches by allowing the efficient computation of time-delayed correlation over
any size sliding window and any time delay. Correlation also lends itself to an efficient grid-based data structure. The
result is the first algorithm that we know of to compute correlations over 
thousands of data streams in real time. The algorithm is incremental, has fixed response time, and can monitor the
pairwise correlations of 10,000 streams on a single {PC}. The algorithm is embarrassingly parallelizable.},

fast retrieval. Due to the dimensionality curse problem, transformations are applied to time series to reduce the number
of dimensions of the feature vectors. Different transformations like Discrete Fourier Transform ({DFT}), Discrete
Wavelet Transform ({DWT}), {Karhunen-Loeve} ({K-L}) transform or Singular Value Decomposition ({SVD}) can be applied.
While the use of {DFT} and {K-L} transform or {SVD} have been studied in the literature, to our knowledge, there is no
in-depth study on the application of {DWT}. In this paper, we propose to use Haar Wavelet Transform for time series
indexing. The major contributions are: (1) we show that Euclidean distance is preserved in the Haar transformed domain
and no false dismissal will occur in range query, (2) we show that Haar transform can outperform {DFT} through
experiments, (3) a new similarity model is suggested to accommodate vertical shift of 
time series, and (4) a two-phase method is proposed for efficient n-nearest neighbor query in time series databases.},

    abstract = {Feature-based similarity searching is emerging as an important search paradigm in database systems. The
technique used is to map the data items as points into a high-dimensional feature space which is indexed using a
multidimensional data structure. Similarity searching then corresponds to a range search over the data structure.
Although several data structures have been proposed for feature indexing, none of them is known to scale beyond 10-15
dimensional spaces. This paper introduces the hybrid tree-a multidimensional data structure for indexing
high-dimensional feature spaces. Unlike other multidimensional data structures, the hybrid tree cannot be classified as
either a pure data partitioning ({DP}) index structure (such as the R-tree, {SS}-tree or {SR}-tree) or a pure space
partitioning ({SP}) one (such as the {KDB}-tree or {hB}-tree); rather it combines the positive aspects of the two types
of index structures into a single data structure to achieve a search performance which is more 
scalable to high dimensionalities than either of the above techniques. Furthermore, unlike many data structures (e.g.
distance-based index structures like the {SS}-tree and {SR}-tree), the hybrid tree can support queries based on
arbitrary distance functions. Our experiments on \&ldquo;real\&rdquo; high-dimensional large-size feature databases
demonstrate that the hybrid tree scales well to high dimensionality and large database sizes. It significantly
outperforms both purely {DP}-based and {SP}-based index mechanisms as well as linear scans at all dimensionalities for
large-sized databases},

important one, with applications in virtually every field of science. A variety of approaches have been suggested. These
approaches are robust to noise, offset translation, and amplitude scaling to varying degrees. However, they are all
extremely sensitive to scaling in the time axis (longitudinal scaling). We present a method for similarity search that
is robust to scaling in the time axis, in addition to noise, offset translation, and amplitude scaling. The method has
been tested on medical, financial, space telemetry and artificial data. Furthermore the method is exceptionally fast,
with the predicted 2 to 4 orders of magnitude speedup actually observed. The method uses a piecewise linear
representation of the original data. We also introduce a new algorithm which both decides the optimal number of linear
segments to use, and produces the actual linear representation.},

standardized testbed in an exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that the R * -tree clearly outperforms the
existing R-tree variants. Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of
the R * -tree holds for different types of queries and operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles and
multidimensional points in all experiments. From a practical point of view the R * -tree is very attractive because of
the following two reasons 1 it efficiently supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2 
its implementation cost is only slightly higher than that of other R-trees.},

    abstract = {The purpose of subsequence matching is to find a query sequence from a long data sequence. Due to the
abundance of applications, many solutions have been proposed. Virtually all previous solutions use the Euclidean measure
as the basis for measuring distance between sequences. Recent studies, however, suggest that the Euclidean distance
often fails to produce proper results due to the irregularity in the data, which is not so uncommon in our problem
domain. Addressing this problem, some {non-Euclidean} measures, such as Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) and Longest Common
Subsequence ({LCS}), have been proposed. However, most of the previous work in this direction focused on the whole
sequence matching problem where query and data sequences are the same length. In this paper, we propose a novel
subsequence matching framework using a {non-Euclidean} measure, in particular, {LCS}, and a new index query scheme. The
proposed framework is based on the Dual Match framework where data sequences are 
divided into a series of disjoint equi-length subsequences and then indexed in an R-tree. We introduced similarity bound
for index matching with {LCS}. The proposed query matching scheme reduces significant numbers of false positives in the
match result. Furthermore, we developed an algorithm to skip expensive {LCS} computations through observing the warping
paths. We validated our framework through extensive experiments using 48 different time series datasets. The results of
the experiments suggest that our approach significantly improves the subsequence matching performance in various
metrics.},

    abstract = {Jagadish et al. (see Proc. {ACM} {SIGACT}-{SIGMOD}-{SIGART} {PODS}, p.36-45, 1995) developed a general
framework for posing queries based on similarity. The framework enables a formal definition of the notion of similarity
for an application domain of choice, and then its use in queries to perform similarity-based search. We adapt this
framework to the specialized domain of real-valued sequences. (Although some of the ideas we present are applicable to
other types of data as well). In particular we focus on whole-match queries. By whole-match query we mean the case where
the user has to specify the whole sequence. Similarity-based search can be computationally very expensive. The
computation cost depends heavily on the length of sequences being compared. To make such similarity testing feasible on
large data sets, we propose the use of a signature based technique. In a nutshell, our approach is to
\&ldquo;shrink\&rdquo; the data sequences into signatures, and search the signatures instead of 
the real sequences, with further comparison being required only when a possible match is indicated. Being shorter,
signatures can usually be compared much faster than the original sequences. In addition, signatures are usually easier
to index. For such a signature-based technique to be effective one has to assure that (1) the signature comparison is
fast, and (2) the signature comparison gives few false alarms, and no false dismissals. We obtain measures of goodness
for our technique. The technique is illustrated with a couple of very different examples},

mining, including Fourier transforms, wavelets, eigenwaves, piecewise polynomial models, etc. Many researchers have also
considered symbolic representations of time series, noting that such representations would potentiality allow
researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics
communities. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all
suffer from two fatal flaws. First, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data,
and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Second, although distance measures can be
defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on
the original time series. In this work we formulate a new symbolic representation of time 
series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance
measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original
series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data
mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the
algorithms that operate on the original data. In particular, we will demonstrate the utility of our representation on
various data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content, anomaly detection, motif discovery, and

sequences. Each point in the sequence is a numerical value. We show how to compress such a dataset into a format that
supports ad hoc querying, provided that a small error can be tolerated when the data is uncompressed. Experiments on
large, real world datasets ( {AT}\&{amp;T}  customer calling patterns) show that the proposed method achieves an average
of less than 5\% error in any data value after compressing to a mere 2.5\% of the original space ( i.e. , a 40:1
compression ratio), with these numbers not very sensitive to dataset size. Experiments on aggregate queries achieved a
0.5\% reconstruction error with a space requirement under 2\%.},

    abstract = {Similarity-based search over time-series databases has been a hot research topic for a long history,
which is widely used in many applications, including multimedia retrieval, data mining, web search and retrieval, and so
on. However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) of the time series, the similarity search over directly indexed
time series usually encounters a serious problem, known as the "dimensionality curse". Thus, many dimensionality
reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing the dimensionality of time series. Among all the
proposed methods, only  Piecewise Linear Approximation  ({PLA}) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity
queries, which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initial studies on the
effectiveness of different reduction methods, however, show that {PLA} performs no worse than others. Motivated by this,
in this paper, we re-investigate {PLA} for approximating and indexing time 
series. Specifically, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced {PLA}-space, and prove that this function
indeed results in a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original time series, which can lead to no  false
dismissals  during the similarity search. As a second step, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds
to improve the search efficiency. Our extensive experiments over a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data sets have
demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of {PLA} together with the newly proposed lower bound distance, in terms
of both  pruning power  and  wall clock time , compared with two state-of-the-art reduction methods,  Adaptive Piecewise
Constant Approximation  ({APCA}) and  Chebyshev Polynomials  ({CP}).},

    abstract = {Similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much research interest recently. It is a
difficult problem because of the typically high dimensionality of the data. The most promising solutions involve
performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure.
Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition ({SVD}), the
Discrete Fourier transform ({DFT}), and the Discrete Wavelet Transform ({DWT}). In this article, we introduce a new
dimensionality reduction technique, which we call Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation ({APCA}). While previous
techniques (e.g., {SVD}, {DFT} and {DWT}) choose a common representation for all the items in the database that
minimizes the global reconstruction error, {APCA} approximates each time series by a set of constant value segments of
varying lengths such that their individual reconstruction errors are minimal. We show how {
APCA} can be indexed using a multidimensional index structure. We propose two distance measures in the indexed space
that exploit the high fidelity of {APCA} for fast searching: a lower bounding Euclidean distance approximation, and a
non-lower-bounding, but very tight, Euclidean distance approximation, and show how they can support fast exact searching
and even faster approximate searching on the same index structure. We theoretically and empirically compare {APCA} to
all the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority.},

    abstract = {The parallel explosions of interest in streaming data, and data mining of time series have had
surprisingly little intersection. This is in spite of the fact that time series data are typically streaming data. The
main reason for this apparent paradox is the fact that the vast majority of work on streaming data explicitly assumes
that the data is discrete, whereas the vast majority of time series data is real {valued.Many} researchers have also
considered transforming real valued time series into symbolic representations, nothing that such representations would
potentially allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and
bioinformatics communities, in addition to allowing formerly "batch-only" problems to be tackled by the streaming
community. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all
suffer from three fatal flaws. Firstly, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is 
the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Secondly,
although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation
with distance measures defined on the original time series. Finally, most of these symbolic approaches require one to
have access to all the data, before creating the symbolic representation. This last feature explicitly thwarts efforts
to use the representations with streaming {algorithms.In} this work we introduce a new symbolic representation of time
series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance
measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original
series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data
mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation,
 while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. Finally, our representation
allows the real valued data to be converted in a streaming fashion, with only an infinitesimal time and space
{overhead.We} will demonstrate the utility of our representation on the classic data mining tasks of clustering,
classification, query by content and anomaly detection.},

warping distance. However, the complexity of computing the time warping distance function is high. Also, as time warping
distance is not a metric, most indexing techniques would not guarantee any false dismissal. We propose efficient
strategies to mitigate the problems of time warping. We suggest a Haar wavelet-

as biology, environmental research, medicine, or stock chart analysis. As nearly all data mining tasks on this kind of
data depend on a distance function between two time series, a huge number of such functions has been developed during
the last decades. The introduction of threshold-based distance functions presented a new concept of time series
similarity and these functions were applied to data mining techniques on a wide spectrum of time series data. In this
demonstration, we present the Java toolkit {T-Time} which is able to perform several data mining tasks for a complete
range of threshold values in an interactive way. The results are visually presented in a very concise way so that the
user can easily identify important threshold values. Combined with domain-specific knowledge, these pivotal values can
yield novel insights beyond the means of the underlying data mining techniques the 
analysis is based on.},

    abstract = {The paper investigates the possibilities of using clustering techniques in visual exploration and
analysis of large numbers of trajectories, that is, sequences of time-stamped locations of some moving entities.
Trajectories are complex spatio-temporal constructs characterized by diverse non-trivial properties. To assess the
degree of (dis)similarity between trajectories, specific methods (distance functions) are required. A single distance
function accounting for all properties of trajectories, (1) is difficult to build, (2) would require much time to
compute, and (3) might be difficult to understand and to use. We suggest the procedure of progressive clustering where a
simple distance function with a clear meaning is applied on each step, which leads to easily interpretable outcomes.
Successive application of several different functions enables sophisticated analyses through gradual refinement of
earlier obtained results. Besides the advantages from the sense-making perspective, progressive 
clustering enables a rational work organization where time-consuming computations are applied to relatively small
potentially interesting subsets obtained by means of 'cheap' distance functions producing quick results. We introduce
the concept of progressive clustering by an example of analyzing a large real data set. We also review the existing
clustering methods, describe the method {OPTICS} suitable for progressive clustering of trajectories, and briefly
present several distance functions for trajectories.},

to a specific cluster at the exclusion of other clusters. This paper is an investigation into the predictive power of
the clustering technique on stock market data and its ability to provide stock predictions that can be utilised in
strategies that outperform the underlying market. This uses a brute force approach to the prediction of stock prices
based on the formation of a cluster around the query sequence. The prediction is then applied in a model designed to
capitalise on the derived prediction. The predictive accuracy of minimum distance clusters produced promising results

    abstract = {Monitoring predefined patterns in streaming time series is useful to applications such as trend-related
analysis, sensor networks and video surveillance. Most current studies on such monitoring employ Euclidean distance to
calculate the similarities between given query patterns and subsequences of streaming time series. Euclidean distance
has been shown to be ineffective in measuring distances of time series in which shifting and scaling usually exist.
Consequently, warping distances such as dynamic time warping ({DTW}), longest common subsequence ({LCSS}), have been
proposed to handle warps in temporal dimension. However, they are inadequate in handling shifting and scaling in
amplitude dimension. Moreover, they have been designed mainly for full sequence matching, whereas in online monitoring
applications, we typically have no knowledge on the positions and lengths of possible matching subsequences. In this
paper, we first discuss the weaknesses of existing warping distances on detecting 
patterns from streaming time series. We then propose a novel warping distance, which we name Spatial Assembling Distance
({SpADe}), that is able to handle shifting and scaling in both temporal and amplitude dimensions. We further propose an
efficient approach for continuous pattern detection using {SpADe}, that is fundamental for subsequence matching on
streaming data. Finally, our experimental results show that {SpADe} is effective and efficient for continuous pattern
detection in streaming time series.},

    abstract = {In a way similar to the string-to-string correction problem, we address discrete time series similarity
in light of a time-series-to-time-series-correction problem for which the similarity between two time series is measured
as the minimum cost sequence of edit operations needed to transform one time series into another. To define the edit
operations, we use the paradigm of a graphical editing process and end up with a dynamic programming algorithm that we
call time warp edit distance ({TWED}). {TWED} is slightly different in form from dynamic time warping ({DTW}), longest
common subsequence ({LCSS}), or edit distance with real penalty ({ERP}) algorithms. In particular, it highlights a
parameter that controls a kind of stiffness of the elastic measure along the time axis. We show that the similarity
provided by {TWED} is a potentially useful metric in time series retrieval applications since it could benefit from the
triangular inequality property to speed up the retrieval process while 
tuning the parameters of the elastic measure. In that context, a lower bound is derived to link the matching of time
series into down sampled representation spaces to the matching into the original space. The empiric quality of the
{TWED} distance is evaluated on a simple classification task. Compared to edit distance, {DTW}, {LCSS}, and {ERP},
{TWED} has proved to be quite effective on the considered experimental task.},

    abstract = {The last few years have seen an increasing understanding that Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}), a technique
that allows local flexibility in aligning time series, is superior to the ubiquitous Euclidean Distance for time series
classification, clustering, and indexing. More recently, it has been shown that for some problems, Uniform Scaling
({US}), a technique that allows global scaling of time series, may just be as important for some problems. In this work,
we note that for many real world problems, it is necessary to combine both {DTW} and {US} to achieve meaningful results.
This is particularly true in domains where we must account for the natural variability of human action, including
biometrics, query by humming, motion-capture/animation, and handwriting recognition. We introduce the first technique
which can handle both {DTW} and {US} simultaneously, and demonstrate its utility and effectiveness on a wide range of
problems in industry, medicine, and entertainment.},

@article{citeulike:1082000,
    abstract = {Periodicity mining is used for predicting trends in time series data. Discovering the rate at which the
time series is periodic has always been an obstacle for fully automated periodicity mining. Existing periodicity mining
algorithms assume that the periodicity rate (or simply the period) is user-specified. This assumption is a considerable
limitation, especially in time series data where the period is not known a priori. In this paper, we address the problem
of detecting the periodicity rate of a time series database. Two types of periodicities are defined, and a scalable,
computationally efficient algorithm is proposed for each type. The algorithms perform in O(n\log n) time for a time
series of length n. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are extended in order to discover the periodic patterns of unknown
periods at the same time without affecting the time complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms
are highly accurate with respect to the discovered periodicity rates 
and periodic patterns. Real-data experiments demonstrate the practicality of the discovered periodic patterns.},

many new or revised R functions and all of the data used in the book,
accompanies the written text. Script files of R commands for each chapter are

gap between methods and realistic applications. This book contains the most
important approaches to analyse time series which may be stationary or
nonstationary. Modelling and forecasting univariate time series is the
starting point. For multiple stationary time series Granger causality tests
and vector autoregressive models are presented. For real applied work the
modelling of nonstationary uni- or multivariate time series is most important.
Therefore, unit root and cointegration analysis as well as vector error
correction models play a central part. Modelling volatilities of financial
time series with autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic models is also
treated.},

    abstract = {Time series data, due to their numerical and continuous nature, are difficult to process, analyze, and
mine. However, these tasks become easier when the data can be transformed into meaningful symbols. Most recent works on
time series only address how to identify a given pattern from a time series and do not consider the problem of
identifying a suitable set of time points for segmenting the time series in accordance with a given set of pattern
templates (e.g., a set of technical patterns for stock analysis). However, the use of fixed-length segmentation is an
oversimplified approach to this problem; hence, a dynamic approach (with high controllability) is preferable so that the
time series can be segmented flexibly and effectively according to the needs of the users and the applications. In view
of the fact that this segmentation problem is an optimization problem and evolutionary computation is an appropriate
tool to solve it, we propose an evolutionary time series segmentation algorithm. 
This approach allows a sizeable set of pattern templates to be generated for mining or query. In addition, defining
similarity between time series (or time series segments) is of fundamental importance in fitness computation. By
identifying the perceptually important points directly from the time domain, time series segments and templates of
different lengths can be compared and intuitive pattern matching can be carried out in an effective and efficient
manner. Encouraging experimental results are reported from tests that segment both artificial time series generated from
the combinations of pattern templates and the time series of selected Hong Kong stocks.},

    abstract = {This collection of twenty-three original papers represents the first effort to
bring together the work of constraint programming researchers scattered across
multiple disciplines and across the world. The collection contributes to the
understanding of the common principles of this emerging general paradigm, the
investigation of its theoretical foundations as well as applications to real-
world computing problems. It is organized around themes of concurrency and
reactive systems, languages and environments, algorithms, computer graphics,
and artificial intelligence. Constraint programming aims at supporting a wide
range of complex applications which are often modeled naturally in terms of
constraints. Early work, in the 1960s and 1970s, made use of constraints in
computer graphics, user interfaces, and artificial intelligence. Such work
introduced a declarative component in otherwise-procedural systems to reduce
the development effort. The mid-1980s have witnessed the emergence of general-
purpose programming languages based on constraints, such as constraint logic
programming and concurrent constraint programming, with significant
applications in academia and industry. Today, an increasing number of
researchers from all over the map of computing are looking at different
aspects of this new computational paradigm.},

training is needed. Previous query by humming systems have not provided satisfactory results for various reasons. Some
systems have low retrieval precision because they rely on melodic contour information from the hum tune, which in turn
relies on the error-prone note segmentation process. Some systems yield better precision when matching the melody
directly from audio, but they are slow because of their extensive use of Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}). Our approach
improves both the retrieval precision and speed compared to previous approaches. We treat music as a time series and
exploit and improve well-developed techniques from time series databases to index the music for fast similarity queries.
We improve on existing {DTW} indexes technique by introducing the concept of  envelope transforms , which gives a
general guideline for extending existing dimensionality reduction methods to {DTW} indexes.
 The net result is high scalability. We confirm our claims through extensive experiments.},

    abstract = {Motivation: Increasingly, biological processes are being studied   through time series of {RNA}
expression data collected for large   numbers of genes. Because common processes may unfold at varying   rates in
different experiments or individuals, methods are needed that will allow corresponding expression states in different
time series to be mapped to one another.  Results: We present implementations of time warping algorithms   applicable to
{RNA} and protein expression data and demonstrate their application to published yeast {RNA} expression time series.
Programs executing two warping algorithms are described, a simple warping algorithm and an interpolative algorithm,
along with programs that generate graphics that visually present alignment information. We show time warping to be
superior to simple clustering at mapping corresponding time states. We document the impact of statistical measurement
noise and sample size on the quality of time alignments,  and present issues related to 
statistical assessment of alignment   quality through alignment scores. We also discuss directions for algorithm
improvement including development of multiple time series alignments and possible applications to causality searches and
non-temporal processes ( concentration warping').  Availability: Academic implementations of alignment programs  
genewarp and genewarpi and the graphics generation programs grphwarp and grphwarpi are available as Win32 system {DOS}
box executables on our web site along with documentation on their use. The publicly available data on which they were

massive volume of streaming time series available through sensors, medical patient records, financial indices and space

may be impossible for the comparison algorithm to keep up. We propose a novel technique that exploits the commonality
among the predefined patterns to allow monitoring at higher bandwidths, while maintaining a guarantee of no false

extensive experiments in diverse domains, our approach achieves tremendous improvements in performance in the offline

retrieval, and processing has drastically increased. This includes videos, images, and audios, where we now have higher
expectations in exploiting these data at hands. Typical manipulations are in some forms of video/image/audio processing,
including automatic speech recognition, which require fairly large amount of storage and are computationally intensive.
In our recent work, we have demonstrated the utility of time series representation in the task of clustering multimedia
data using k-medoids method, which allows considerable amount of reduction in computational effort and storage space.
However, k- means is a much more generic clustering method when Euclidean distance is used. In this work, we will
demonstrate that unfortunately, k-means clustering will sometimes fail to give correct results, an unaware fact that may
be overlooked by many researchers. This is especially the case when 
Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) is used as the distance measure in averaging the shape of time series. We also will
demonstrate that the current averaging algorithm may not produce the real average of the time series, thus generates
incorrect k-means clustering results, and then show potential causes why {DTW} averaging methods may not achieve
meaningful clustering results. Lastly, we conclude with a suggestion of a method to potentially find the shape-based
time series average that satisfies the required properties.},

    abstract = {Fast similarity searching in large time sequence databases has typically used Euclidean distance as a
dissimilarity metric. However, for several applications, including matching of voice, audio and medical signals (e.g.,
electrocardiograms), one is required to permit local accelerations and decelerations in the rate of sequences, leading
to a popular, field tested dissimilarity metric called the \&ldquo;time warping\&rdquo; distance. From the indexing
viewpoint, this metric presents two major challenges: (a) it does not lead to any natural indexable
\&ldquo;features\&rdquo;, and (b) comparing two sequences requires time quadratic in the sequence length. To address
each problem, we propose to use: (a) a modification of the so called \&{ldquo;FastMap}\&rdquo;, to map sequences into
points, with little compromise of \&ldquo;recall\&rdquo; (typically zero); and (b) a fast linear test, to help us
discard quickly many of the false alarms that {FastMap} will typically introduce. Using both ideas in 
cascade, our proposed method achieved up to an order of magnitude speed-up over sequential scanning on both real and
synthetic datasets},

matching technique by determining the distance between the unknown input and a set of previously defined templates. A
dynamic time warping ({DTW}) algorithm is used to perform the time alignment and normalization by computing a temporal
transformation allowing the two signals to be matched. The system is trained with finite video sequences of single
gesture performances whose start and end point are accurately known. Preliminary experiments are accomplished off-line

Nevertheless, typical content-based search for multimedia data usually requires a large amount of storages and is
computationally intensive. Recently, time series representation has been successfully applied to a wide variety of
research, including multimedia retrieval due to the great reduction in time and space complexity. Besides, an
enhancement, Uniform Scaling, has been proposed and applied prior to distance calculation, as well as it has been
demonstrated that Uniform Scaling can outperform Euclidean distance. These previous work on Uniform Scaling, 
nonetheless, overlook the importance and effects of normalisation, which make their frameworks impractical for real

handwriting recognition system frog on hand. The focus of this work concerns the presentation of the
classification/training approach, which we call cluster generative statistical dynamic time warping ({CSDTW}). {CSDTW}
is a general, scalable, {HMM}-based method for variable-sized, sequential data that holistically combines cluster
analysis and statistical sequence modeling. It can handle general classification problems that rely on this sequential
type of data, e.g., speech recognition, genome processing, robotics, etc. Contrary to previous attempts, clustering and
statistical sequence modeling are embedded in a single feature space and use a closely related distance measure. We show
character recognition experiments of frog on hand using {CSDTW} on the {UNIPEN} online handwriting database. The
recognition accuracy is significantly higher than reported results of other handwriting recognition 
systems. Finally, we describe the real-time implementation of frog on hand on a Linux Compaq {iPAQ} embedded device.},

    abstract = {Poor handwriting is a diagnostic criterion for developmental coordination disorder. Typical of poor
handwriting is its low overall quality and the high variability of the spatial characteristics of the letters, usually
assessed with a subjective handwriting scale. Recently, Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}), a technique originally developed
for speech recognition, was introduced for pattern recognition in handwriting. The present study evaluates its
application to analyze poor handwriting. Forty children attending Dutch mainstream primary schools were recruited and
based on their scores on the Concise Evaluation Scale for Children's Handwriting (Dutch abbreviation: {BHK}), 20 good
and 20 poor writers (of whom 13 were scheduled for handwriting intervention) were identified. The groups were matched
for age (7-9 years), school grade (grades 2 and 3) and handedness. The children subsequently wrote sequences of the
letter "a" on a graphics tablet in three conditions (normal, fast, and accurate). 
Classical kinematics were obtained and for each individual letter {DTW} was used to calculate the distance from the mean
shape. The {DTW} data revealed much higher variability in the letter forms of the poor writers that was independent of
the kinematic results of larger trajectories, faster movements, and higher pen pressure. The current results suggest
that {DTW} is a valid and objective technique for letter-form analysis in handwriting and may hence be useful to
evaluate the rehabilitation treatments of children suffering from poor handwriting. In education research it may be
exploited to explore how children (should) learn to write.},

@article{citeulike:1807913,
    abstract = {Despite their known weaknesses, hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) have been the dominant technique for
acoustic modeling in speech recognition for over two decades. Still, the advances in the {HMM} framework have not solved
its key problems: it discards information about time dependencies and is prone to overgeneralization. In this paper, we
attempt to overcome these problems by relying on straightforward template matching. The basis for the recognizer is the
well-known {DTW} algorithm. However, classical {DTW} continuous speech recognition results in an explosion of the search
space. The traditional top-down search is therefore complemented with a data-driven selection of candidates for {DTW}
alignment. We also extend the {DTW} framework with a flexible subword unit mechanism and a class sensitive distance
measure-two components suggested by state-of-the-art {HMM} systems. The added flexibility of the unit selection in the
template-based framework leads to new approaches to speaker and 
environment adaptation. The template matching system reaches a performance somewhat worse than the best published {HMM}
results for the Resource Management benchmark, but thanks to complementarity of errors between the {HMM} and {DTW}
systems, the combination of both leads to a decrease in word error rate with 17\% compared to the {HMM} results},

    abstract = {Finding similar patterns in a time sequence is a well-studied problem. Most of the current techniques
work well for queries of a prespecified length, but not for variable length queries. We propose a new indexing technique
that works well for variable length queries. The central idea is to store index structures at different resolutions for
a given dataset. The resolutions are based on wavelets. For a given query, a number of subqueries at different
resolutions are generated. The ranges of the subqueries are progressively refined based on results from previous
subqueries. Our experiments show that the total cost for our method is 4 to 20 times less than the current techniques
including linear scan. Because of the need to store information at multiple resolution levels, the storage requirement
of our method could potentially be large. In the second part of the paper we show how the index information can be
compressed with minimal information loss. According to our experimental results, even 
after compressing the size of the index to one fifth, the total cost of our method is 3 to 15 times less than the
current techniques},

    abstract = {The technique of dynamic programming for the time registration of a reference and a test pattern has
found widespread use in the area of isolated word recognition. Recently, a number of variations on the basic time
warping algorithm have been proposed by Sakoe and Chiba, and Rabiner, Rosenberg, and Levinson. These algorithms all
assume that the test input is the time pattern of a feature vector from an isolated word whose endpoints are known (at
least approximately). The major differences in the methods are the global path constraints (i.e., the region of possible
warping paths), the local continuity constraints on the path, and the distance weighting and normalization used to give
the overall minimum distance. The purpose of this investigation is to study the effects of such variations on the
performance of different dynamic time warping algorithms for a realistic speech database. The performance measures that
were used include: speed of operation, memory requirements, and recognition 
accuracy. The results show that both axis orientation and relative length of the reference and the test patterns are
important factors in recognition accuracy. Our results suggest a new approach to dynamic time warping for isolated words
in which both the reference and test patterns are linearly warped to a fixed length, and then a simplified dynamic time
warping algorithm is used to handle the nonlinear component of the time alignment. Results with this new algorithm show
performance comparable to or better than that of all other dynamic time warping algorithms that were studied.},

@article{citeulike:3568196,
    abstract = {To recognize speech, handwriting or sign language, many hybrid approaches have been proposed that
combine Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) or Hidden Markov Models ({HMM}) with discriminative classifiers. However, all
methods rely directly on the likelihood models of {DTW}/{HMM}. We hypothesize that time warping and classification
should be separated because of conflicting likelihood modelling demands. To overcome these restrictions, we propose to
use Statistical {DTW} ({SDTW}) only for time warping, while classifying the warped features with a different method. Two
novel statistical classifiers are proposed ({CDFD} and {Q-DFFM}), both using a selection of discriminative features
({DF}), and are shown to outperform {HMM} and {SDTW}. However, we have found that combining likelihoods of multiple
models in a second classification stage degrades performance of the proposed classifiers, while improving performance
with {HMM} and {SDTW}. A proof-of-concept experiment, combining {DFFM} mappings of 
multiple {SDTW} models with {SDTW} likelihoods, shows that also for model-combining, hybrid classification can provide
significant improvement over {SDTW}. Although recognition is mainly based on {3D} hand motion features, these results
can be expected to generalize to recognition with more detailed measurements such as hand/body pose and facial

distance measures commonly adopted for comparing time series, such as Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}), either

a novel {DTW}-like distance measure, called {Stream-DTW} ({SDTW}), which unlike {DTW} can be efficiently updated at each

grows linearly with the size of the window sliding over the streams. For instance, with a sliding window of 512 samples,
{SDTW} is about 600 times faster than {DTW}. We also show that {SDTW} is a tight approximation of {DTW}, errors never
exceeding 10\%, and that it consistently outperforms approximations

self-similarities within the motion. In Sect. 10.3, we describe how this idea can be exploited for motion retrieval.

    abstract = {A computer system is described in which isolated words, spoken by a designated talker, are recognized
through calculation of a minimum prediction residual. A reference pattern for each word to be recognized is stored as a
time pattern of linear prediction coefficients ({LPC}). The total log prediction residual of an input signal is
minimized by optimally registering the reference {LPC} onto the input autocorrelation coefficients using the dynamic
programming algorithm ({DP}). The input signal is recognized as the reference word which produces the minimum prediction
residual. A sequential decision procedure is used to reduce the amount of computation in {DP}. A frequency normalization
with respect to the long-time spectral distribution is used to reduce effects of variations in the frequency response of
telephone connections.  The system has been implemented on a {DDP}-516 computer for the 200-word recognition experiment.
The recognition rate for a designated male talker is 97.3 percent for 
telephone input, and the recognition time is about 22 times real time.},

                Papaya, a fruit crop cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, is known for its nutritional
benefits and medicinal applications. Here we report a 3x draft genome sequence of '{SunUp}' papaya, the first commercial
virus-resistant transgenic fruit tree to be sequenced. The papaya genome is three times the size of the Arabidopsis
genome, but contains fewer genes, including significantly fewer disease-resistance gene analogues. Comparison of the
five sequenced genomes suggests a minimal angiosperm gene set of 13,311. A lack of recent genome duplication, atypical
of other angiosperm genomes sequenced so far, may account for the smaller papaya gene number in most functional groups.
Nonetheless, striking amplifications in gene number within particular functional groups suggest roles in the evolution
of tree-like habit, deposition and remobilization of starch reserves, attraction of seed dispersal agents, and
adaptation to tropical daylengths. Transgenesis at three locations is closely 
associated with chloroplast insertions into the nuclear genome, and with topoisomerase I recognition sites. Papaya
offers numerous advantages as a system for fruit-tree functional genomics, and this draft genome sequence provides the
foundation for revealing the basis of Carica's distinguishing morpho-physiological, medicinal and nutritional
properties.

    abstract = {This paper reports on an optimum dynamic progxamming ({DP}) based time-normalization algorithm for
spoken word recognition. First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then,
two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These
two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form
algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the
warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The
effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is
determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with
various {DP}-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different 
research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even
compared to the best conventional algorithm.},

  abstract = {Modern web applications consist of a significant amount of client-side code, written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. In this paper, we present a study of common challenges and misconceptions among web developers, by mining related questions asked on Stack Overflow. We use unsupervised learning to categorize the mined questions and define a ranking algorithm to rank all the Stack Overflow questions based on their importance. We analyze the top 50 questions qualitatively. The results indicate that (1) the overall share of web development related discussions is increasing among developers, (2) browser related discussions are prevalent; however, this share is decreasing with time, (3) form validation and other DOM related discussions have been discussed consistently over time, (4) web related discussions are becoming more prevalent in mobile development, and (5) developers face implementation issues with new HTML5 features such as Canvas. We examine the implications of the results on the development, research, and standardization communities.}
