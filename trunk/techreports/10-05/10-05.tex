\begin{abstract}  % 200 words
  WattDepot is an open source, ethernet-based, service-oriented framework,
  for collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of energy data.
  WattDepot differs from other energy management solutions in one or more
  of the following ways: it is not tied to any specific metering
  technology; it provides high-level support for meter aggregation and data
  interpolation; it supports carbon intensity analysis; it is
  architecturally decoupled from the underlying storage technology; it
  supports both hosted and local energy services; it can provide near-real
  time data collection and feedback; and the software is open source and
  freely available.  In this paper, we introduce the framework, provide
  examples of its use, and discuss its application to research and
  understanding of the Smart Grid.
