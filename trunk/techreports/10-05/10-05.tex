  WattDepot is an open source, Internet-based, service-oriented framework 
  for collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of energy data.
  WattDepot differs from other energy management solutions in one or more
  of the following ways: it is not tied to any specific metering
  technology; it provides high-level support for meter aggregation and data
  interpolation; it supports carbon intensity analysis; it is
  architecturally decoupled from the underlying storage technology; it
  supports both hosted and local energy services; it can provide near-real
  time data collection and feedback; and the software is open source and
  freely available.  In this paper, we introduce the framework, provide
  examples of its use, and discuss its application to research and
  understanding of the Smart Grid.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Recent interest in the Smart Grid has produced a wide variety of proposed
``open'' standards and technologies for energy data collection, storage,
and analysis.  Some prominent approaches include cloud-based services like
Google PowerMeter \cite{GooglePowerMeter} and Microsoft Hohm
\cite{MicrosoftHohm}, ``interoperable'' protocols and networking approaches
like Smart Energy 2.0 \cite{SmartEnergy2.0} and GridRouter Ecosystem
\cite{GridRouterEcosystem}, smart grid standards like IEEE SCC21
\cite{IEEESCC21} and Oasis Blue \cite{OasisBlue}, extensible energy
management devices like Control4's EMS 100 \cite{EMS100}, and home energy 
meters like the TED 5000 \cite{TED}.  There are also
``open source'' hardware platforms, such as OSHAN \cite{OSHAN}, and open
source software solutions for phasor data such as OpenPDC \cite{OpenPDC}.

For our research on behavioral change among energy consumers in a building
or home environment, we need a way to: (a) collect energy data from a
variety of meters with the possibility of near-real time (5-10 second)
feedback, (b) store the results in an internet-accessable repository; (c)
perform basic analyses on the raw data including aggregation and
interpolation, and (d) visualize the raw and processed data in a variety of
ways, including tables, gauges, trend lines, geo maps, heat maps, and so forth.

Unfortunately, we find that none of the current ``open'' technologies
satisfy these seemingly simple requirements. Either the technology is
designed for a specific brand of meter (such as the EMS 100 or TED 5000), or it does not
support near-real time feedback (such as Google PowerMeter and Microsoft
Hohm), or it focuses on utility issues (OpenPDC), or it focusses on
wire-level or hardware concerns (OSHAN, GridRouter Ecosystem).

Rather than implement a special purpose solution for our research, we
decided to leverage our prior experience in open source software
engineering measurement systems to design and implement an open source,
extensible, service-oriented framework for energy data collection, storage,
analysis, and visualization. Our framework, called WattDepot, consists of
three kinds of services:

\begin{itemize}
\item WattDepot {\em sensors}, each customized for a particular brand of
energy meter.  A sensor requests data from a meter according to the meter's
protocol, then sends it to a WattDepot repository for storage.

\item WattDepot {\em repositories}, which implement a REST \cite{REST} API
for accepting energy data sent from sensors and providing this sensor data
(or analyses based upon the data) to WattDepot clients.

\item WattDepot {\em clients}, which request data from WattDepot
repositories and either visualize the data or analyses directly to users or
provide the data to higher level energy services.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the architecture of the system.

For example, consider a University that wants to implement a dorm energy
competition in which energy meters will be installed on each floor of the
dorm and residents of each floor will compete against each other to see who
can reduce their energy the most.  Prior to WattDepot, one could either buy a
proprietary, ``black box'' solution such as the Building Dashboard from
Lucid Design Group and be restricted to the set of meters and analyses they
support, or else start from scratch and build all of the energy data
collection, analysis, and visualization services.  WattDepot provides an
alternative approach, in which collection, storage, and analysis
capabilities are freely available and amenable to integration within a web
application developed by the user.  For those with some software
development capability, this can be a lower cost solution and/or support
customization beyond the ability of current proprietary solutions.

WattDepot services are designed at the ``enterprise'' scale as opposed to
the ``home'' or ``utility'' scales.  By home scale, we mean systems like
the TED 5000, which are designed to collect and analyze data about a single
residence, typically through a simple ``dashboard'' interface that runs on
the user's local area network and/or power line.  WattDepot is designed to
collect, store, and analyze data from a wider range of locations using the
Internet as the transmission mechanism, and our performance analysis tests
indicate that it can easily process several thousand sensor data storage
requests per minute given adequate network bandwidth.  On the other hand,
by utility scale, we mean systems that can collect and store grid-level
data comprising tens or hundreds of thousands of residences, with
revenue-grade measurement, hardened storage, and security mechanisms.
WattDepot is not intended for these more rigorous utility-level
requirements.  Our goal for WattDepot is to provide a mechanism to
accelerate innovative research and development in energy analysis and
visualization by providing an extensible architecture and well documented,
open source software platform.

The next section of this paper introduces the basic components of
WattDepot. Following this we describe some of our initial experiences with
the framework and conclude with our future directions. 

\section{WattDepot Services}

\subsection{Sensors}

Electricity can be generated and/or consumed by a wide variety of devices
and monitored by a wide variety of metering technologies.  Many energy
management software systems are tied to a particular energy device and/or
meter; indeed, they are often marketed as an accessory to the hardware.  For
example, a solar panel company might provide software for storing data
about the power generated by the panel and simple visualizations of the
power generated over time.

The design of WattDepot attempts to make the software as independent from
the energy hardware devices as possible.  In WattDepot, it is the device
that is the accessory to the software.  To achieve this independence, the
WattDepot architecture includes ``sensors'', or small software processes
that query any given energy device according to its native protocol,
collect standard information, and then send it to a WattDepot server using
the Internet and the RESTful WattDepot HTTP protocol.  This design means
that new energy devices can be integrated easily into the WattDepot
software ecosystem just by writing the sensor interface.  The use of a
RESTful HTTP protocol for communication with the WattDepot server means
that the sensor can be implemented in any programming language.

We have implemented WattDepot sensors for the TED 5000 home energy device, 
the BMO building management meter, and for the Aquivim energy meter. This
latter sensor is particularly interesting because it is communicates with the
meter through the standard ModBus/TCP protocol.  The sensor is designed in 
a modular way so that it is easy to customize to support other meters that 
communicate using ModBus/TCP.

of ecotricity interface, and the Kukui Cup competition.}

\section{Future Directions}

{\em Micro-grids? Smart homes? Bayesian networks?}
