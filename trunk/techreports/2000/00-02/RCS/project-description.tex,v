\section{Project Description}
%No more than 1000 words, currently ? words

\subsection{Introduction}
%What problem are you solving?
% 283 words
Anyone who has ever had an email account has received messages containing
unwanted advertisements (commonly called spam or Unsolicited Commercial Email
[UCE]). The problem of spam has spawned fierce debate, considerable software
development (both for sending it and for filtering it), and plenty of
legislation. Despite all this, there are lots of marketers who continue to send
spam and millions of email users who want to get it out of their in-box.

Spam has become a big problem because allows mass marketers to shift the costs
of delivering their advertisements to the recipient in a way that is not
possible with traditional media. When an advertiser sends you junk mail or
calls you on the phone it costs them a small amount of money each time they do
so. With spam the cost to the sender is miniscule, with most of the cost is
absorbed by the receiver and their Internet Service Provider (ISP). This
results in marketers being tempted to send out their advertisements to hundreds
of thousands of people knowing that even a 0.1\% response rate will make them a
profit. It also opens the door for advertisements of products like pornography
or illegal cable descramblers which many people don't wish to receive
unsolicited.

The problem is just as bad for the ISPs who process the mail. It's estimated
that as much as 75\% of email traffic is spam (see
\url{<http://www.emarketer.com/estats/020199_email.html>}) which means a
significant amount of an ISP's bandwidth is consumed by spam. The situation is
particularly bad here in Hawaii and around the Pacific Rim where Internet
bandwidth costs many times what it does on the US mainland.

\subsection{Existing Solutions Are Not Effective}
%Why is your solution unique?
% 274 words
The problem of spam has not been solved to date because it is a complicated
issue with economic, social, and political facets. The marketers sending the
messages claim that they are exercising their right to free speech. The
recipients claim their privacy is being violated by having all this unwanted
stuff in their mailbox. ISPs want to stop spending money delivering unwanted
advertisements. For these reasons any real solution should have the following
characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item Marketers should not be prevented from sending out spam because some very
  small percentage of people do actually wish to receive it.
\item Individual users should be in control of who they receive email from.
\item ISPs should be able to reject messages which are unwanted by the
  recipient.
\end{itemize}

Existing attempts to solve the problem include:

\begin{itemize}
\item Legislation. Bills have been proposed (and sometimes passed) at the state
  and federal level. Some bills seek to legitimize spam leading to fears that
  this might be `opening the floodgates'. Other bills seek to criminalize it
  which some feel would be a bad precedent for free speech.
\item Email client filters. These are usually limited to clumsy user-generated
  rules which attempt to catch spam and delete it. Keeping the rules up to date
  is tedious and error prone, and each program has a different way of setting
  up filters.
\item ISP server filters. These filters usually work based on the source of the
  message so they are limited to catching spam runs which have already been
  detected and reported by others. In addition, they typically reject messages
  wholesale which takes the decision out of the hands of the recipient.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adaptive Personalized Spam Filters}
%What is the solution to the problem?
% 347 words
I am proposing a hybrid technical solution to the problem of spam: filtering on
both the user and ISP side. The filtering program on the user side is
predicated on differences between a spam message and a normal message. A series
of tests will be performed on each message in a users incoming mailbox each one
of which will attempt to determine if the message is spam. Some of the obvious
tests that can be used are: is this message actually addressed to the user
(spam frequently is sent with the digital equivalent of ``Current Resident'',
is this message from a previous correspondent, does the message contain
telltale phrases like ``MAKE MONEY FAST''. More subtle tests will look for
things like: excessive CAPITALIZATION, excessive use of exclamation points,
lists of addresses for pyramid schemes. However, unlike most filtering systems
each test will produce a probability instead of a yes or no result. The
accuracy of the tests will be determined by feedback from the user after
examining the actual mail. The probabilities generated by each test will be
combined into a `spam probability' for each message. The spam probability can
be used in several ways: users can sort their email so that the messages that
are probably spam are shown last, or users can set a threshold probability
above which messages are automatically deleted or filed away.

This system has advantages over existing client filters. The system doesn't
have to make binary decisions about spam which allows users to set their own
tolerance for spam. It also adapts to the mail patterns of the individual user
without requiring the user to manually figure out what rules to input. However,
it leaves the final decision in the hands of the user.

%Talk about client software?: Java for platform independence, not dependent
%on a particular email client. IMAP. JavaMail.

The system could be extended to work on the server side as well. ISPs could
install a filter system that examines each message as it is received and
assigns a spam probability. This would allow the ISP to completely reject some
messages based on initial information based on the recipient's stored profile,
thus saving bandwidth.

%How will it actually work?

\subsection{Business Plan}
%How will this make money?
%What is the revenue potential?
%What is the potential market?
% 106 words
I intend to give away the client filtering software. This allows users to start
getting rid of spam immediately and doesn't require their ISP to install any
software (which some ISPs are reluctant to do and even when they want to it can
take months). The server software will be charged for as ISPs are more likely
to be willing to pay since they can simply account for it as a cost of doing
business. The free client software will also act as an excellent advertisement
for the server software: users will download the free software and encourage
their ISP to purchase the server side.

%Next steps/scale up

\subsection{Project Plan}
%What is the timeline for the project?
%What milestones are there along the way to completion?
%What are the deliverables?
% 136 words

I will be working on this project after graduating in Spring 2000. I am
familiar with the tools required to write the software so I expect an initial
version can be completed in a few months. At that point I will release the
client software to the world so I can get actual user feedback. Once the client
software has a sizeable user base then I can work on the server software.

\subsubsection{Deliverables}
% ? words
By the end of the grant award period, I expect to have a working version of the
client software in general public release. Depending on the demand from users,
I may also have a version of server software available. I will also have a
report describing the progress I have made on the project and relating the
lessons learned in the process.
