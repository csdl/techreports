This research would not be possible without the following people who have provided me with guidance, support, and encouragement along the way.

First I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Professor Philip Johnson for the continuous support of my graduate study and research, for his patience, motivation, enthusiasm, and immense knowledge. His guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. I could not have imagined having a better advisor and mentor for my graduate study.

I would also like to thank the rest of my thesis committee: Professor Scott Robertson, and Professor Henri Casanova. Thank you for your guidance, criticisms, and encouragement.

Last, but not least, I would like to thank my family. There is nothing more important to me than my family. I am eternally grateful for the strength, support, and above all, the love that all of you have given to me.
