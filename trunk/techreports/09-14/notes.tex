The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers defines software engineering as 
“the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to development, 
operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering software”
IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary, Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, New
York, 1990.

"There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple 
that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that
there are no obvious deficiencies."
- C.A.R. Hoare
