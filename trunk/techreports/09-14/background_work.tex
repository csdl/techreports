\section{Process mining}
The recognition of interest and importance of various processes 
According to the IEEE Task Force on Process Mining, established in 2009, ``Process mining is 
a relatively young research discipline that sits between computational intelligence and data 
mining on the one hand, and process modeling and analysis on the other hand'' \cite{citeulike:11077707}.
This group promotes the topic of process mining,
