\section{Goals}

We are designing the UH Dorm Energy Competition Project (Kukui
Cup\footnote{Kukui nut oil was used by ancient Hawaiians as a source of light,
  thus serving as a kind of ``electricity''.}) to achieve three goals:
\begin{itemize}
\item Improve the {\em energy literacy} of the participating students;
\item Conduct innovative, cutting edge research in technology design for
  energy-related behavioral change;
\item Save money for the university by reducing energy costs.
\end{itemize}
