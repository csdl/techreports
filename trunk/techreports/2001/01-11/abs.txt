The ICS department of the University of Hawaii has faced problems surrounding approval code distribution as its enrollment has increased. The manual system for approval code allocation was time-consuming, ineffective and inefficient. INCA is designed to automate the task of approval code allocation, improve the quality of course approval decisions, and decrease the administrative overhead involved in those decisions.

Based upon informal feedback from department administrators, it appears that INCA reduces their overhead and makes their life easier. What are the old problems that are solved by INCA? Does INCA introduce new kinds of problems for the administrator? What about the students? Are they completely satisfied with the system? In what ways does the system benefit the department as a whole? 
In this thesis, I will discuss design, implementation and evaluation of INCA. I will evaluate INCA from the viewpoints of students, administrators, and the department. I will do an email analysis to prove that INCA reduces the administrative overheads. I will conduct a user survey to investigate whether INCA improves the predictability and understandability of students. Finally, I will analyze the INCA database to extract the information useful to the departments for course curriculum planning. The evaluation of INCA will provide us with useful insights for future improvements of INCA and improving the student experience with academic systems in general.
