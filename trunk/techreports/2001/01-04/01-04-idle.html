<p align="left">&quot;Validated idle time detection&quot; means two things:
first, that we will detect idle time while working in the IDE, and second, that
we will have a mechanism in place to allow users to validate that the sensor
detects idle time effectively. </p>
<p align="left">A method for detecting idle time that should work in most IDEs
involves the following: </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Create a local variable called &quot;lastActivityTimeStamp&quot;
    that holds a date object. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Add hooks to one or more callbacks within the IDE that
    invokes a &quot;processActivity()&quot; method. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">The processActivity() method makes a timestamp, and then
    compares that value to the saved lastActivityTimestamp. If the interval is
    less than some threshold value (say 5 minutes), then we assume the user is
    active and we update lastActivityTimestamp with the more recent timestamp
    value. If the interval is greater than the threshold value, then we assume
    the user has been idle for that period of time and increment an idle time
    counter by the number of seconds in that interval. Since the processActivity()
    method is only called when the user is active by definition, we can now
    update the lastActivityTimestamp. </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">This is a fine method as long as we know that when the user is
actively working, the processActivity() method is called frequently enough that
the intervals are below threshold and so the idle time calculation does not kick
in. This is the &quot;validation&quot; issue. </p>
<p align="left">We need to provide automated support for validation since it
will be a recurrent issue for each IDE, and indeed for each user of each IDE. We
cannot assume that individual user usage styles are similar enough that once the
Session sensor is validated for one user it is valid for all users. </p>
<p align="left">Thus, I propose an enhancement to the session sensor which can
trigger a new notification type called &quot;Activity&quot;. When that
enhancement is enabled, it results in the processActivity() method _saving_
every timestamp it creates when it is invoked. When the session ends and the
session notification is sent, the sensor will also send an ActivityNotification
whose data is a list of all of the timestamps that it received during that
Session. The analysis associated with the Activity notification is to produce a
table of the relative frequency of intervals between successive timestamps. For
example, </p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">Minutes </td>
    <td width="33%">Number Activity Intervals </td>
    <td width="34%">% </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">0 - 1</td>
    <td width="33%">20</td>
    <td width="34%">40</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">1-3</td>
    <td width="33%">10</td>
    <td width="34%">20</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">3-5</td>
    <td width="33%">19</td>
    <td width="34%">35</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">5-10</td>
    <td width="33%">1</td>
    <td width="34%">5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">&gt; 10</td>
    <td width="33%">0</td>
    <td width="34%">0</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p align="left">The user uses this table to validate session data by reflecting
upon their actual use of the IDE during that session and seeing if the activity
intervals jibe with their subjective sense of activity. The simplest way to
validate is to use the IDE without any idle time, working at your normal pace,
and seeing if the activity intervals occur frequently enough to prevent the idle
time threshold from being reached. If idletime is kicking in for sessions in
which you aren't idle, then there are two alternatives: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">increase the idle time threshold so that idle time doesn't
    kick in, or </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">attach the processActivity() method to more callbacks so
    that it is invoked more frequently. </li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Since validation is potentially expensive, it should be
something that the user enables only initially or intermittently. But it is key
to making sure that the Session data reflects usage. </p>
<p align="left">Cam further suggests that the Activity analysis not only show
the table of intervals, but also a table indicating how much idle time the
session would have under various values for the idle time threshold. Something
like the following: </p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">Session:</td>
    <td width="33%">From: 6/1/2001 14:00:00</td>
    <td width="34%">To: 6/1/2001 14:30:00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">Idle Threshold<br>
      (minutes)</td>
    <td width="33%">Active Time<br>
      (HH:MM:SS)</td>
    <td width="34%">Idle Time<br>
      (HH:MM:SS)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">02</td>
    <td width="33%">00:12:05</td>
    <td width="34%">00:17:50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">04</td>
    <td width="33%">00:18:45</td>
    <td width="34%">00:11:15</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">06</td>
    <td width="33%">00:22:50</td>
    <td width="34%">00:07:10</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">08 </td>
    <td width="33%">00:25:30</td>
    <td width="34%">00:04:30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">10 </td>
    <td width="33%">00:30:00</td>
    <td width="34%">00:00:00</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">15 </td>
    <td width="33%">00:30:00</td>
    <td width="34%">00:00:00</td>
  </tr>

<p align="left">This is an interesting example of a Hackystat &quot;what
if&quot; analysis, which gives the user some guidance in figuring out what their
idle time threshold should be set to. </p>
<p align="left">Let's say that the user figured that in that 30 minute session,
they were actually idle for about five minutes. In that case, setting the idle
time threshold to 2, 4, 10, or 15 minutes would result in the wrong amount of
active/idle time. Between 6 and 8 minutes is probably right. </p>
<p align="left">Without a table like this, it would be hard for the user to
actually figure out how to set the idle time. With the table, it's easy. And the
Activity data allows this kind of post-hoc analysis to take place. </p>
<p align="left">Another issue Cam brings up is how to split a single IDE
invocation into multiple sessions. For example, if Cam brings up Emacs on Monday
and brings it down on Friday, we don't want to have one humongous session for
the entire week. Instead, we'd really rather have a number of smaller sessions,
probably a few a day corresponding to logical &quot;chunks&quot; of hacking
time. </p>
<p align="left">Well, we can actually provide a new kind of
&quot;threshold&quot; to do this as well. The idea is that when the user takes
an action that leads to the invocation of the processActivity() method, that
method will check for idle time as we discussed before, using some kind of small
threshold interval like 5 or 10 minutes. But it can also check for a larger time
interval, say one or two or more hours, and if the difference between the last
timestamp and the current time stamp exceeds this &quot;session threshold&quot;
value, then the system can assume that the last time stamp marks the end of the
last session (and send the data off to the server), and that the current
timestamp marks the beginning of a new session (and initialize things
appropriately).</p>
<p align="left">I love this idea and think we should definitely implement it.
(For one thing, it virtually guarantees that we won't have sessions longer than
99:59:59, which are now illegal anyway!) </p>
<p align="left">Finally, Cam suggested that we extend the Activity log to
contain not just a timestamp, but some kind of indication of what the user was
doing at that moment (i.e. opening file foo.java, compiling bar.java, running
JUnit test TestBaz.java, etc.) The Activity log becomes not just a mechanism for
calibrating idle time, but now it's a potentially fine grained trace of user
actions that the system could use to perform inferences about what the system
has done and what the user needs to do next. Imagine that hackystat could start
automatically running JUnit for you, or sending an email to another user to
inform them of a change that could impact upon their code, etc.</p>
