<p>One goal for Hackystat is to deploy it in a classroom setting such as ICS
111, 211, or 311. As I've thought about that, a number of issues have arisen in
my mind. I'd like to lay them out on the table and get your input so that we can
start moving the system development trajectory in an appropriate direction.</p>
<p>Let me start by noting the following: security and privacy is not really an
issue (well, at least not our issue) if the user runs the Hackystat server
themselves. Then, the degree of security/privacy is based upon how protected
their server is.</p>
<p>In addition, we need to remember that Hackystat's source will be openly
available, so no solution can depend upon restricted access to the source code.</p>
<p>The scenario I'm most concerned with at the moment is one in which users
connect to a &quot;well-known public server&quot;, such as
hackystat.ics.hawaii.edu. I would like to eventually be at the point where we
run a server on a box in CSDL that is available to anyone world-wide who wishes
to use it for storing their data. Though people can always install the server
and run it themselves locally, a well-known public server can enable people to
evaluate the system much more easily; all they have to do is install the sensors
and set the environment variables.</p>
<p>So, under the well-known public server scenario, let me sketch out four
security/privacy problems that immediately rear their ugly heads:</p>
<p>1. Inadvertant manipulation/corruption of another user's hackystat data.</p>
<p>2. Intentional manipulation/corruption of another user's hackystat data.</p>
<p>3. Inadvertant viewing of another user's hackystat data.</p>
<p>4. Intentional viewing of another user's hackystat data.</p>
<p>Hackystat, as it is now implemented, is vulnerable to all four of these
problems because:</p>
<p>(a) manipulation (i.e. addition) of hackystat data is based upon users
self-reporting a username string via the hackystat_user environment variable
that is not guaranteed to be unique and that is used as the key to their area of
the repository;</p>
<p>(b) retrieval of data is not protected; anyone who can guess the URL
corresponding to hackystat data can retrieve it, regardless of whether it is
their data or someone else's.</p>
<p>As an example, here is an url to the user &quot;johnson&quot;'s session data
for this month:</p>
<u>
<p><font COLOR="#0000ff">http://localhost/hackystat/users/johnson/logs/session/2001-06.xml</font></p>
</u>
<p>I, of course, am not the only &quot;johnson&quot; who might want to use
hackystat.ics.hawaii.edu, and it is only a matter of time under the current
design until someone else decides to use &quot;johnson&quot;. At that point, our
data will simply be merged together, and we would both be viewing the same set
of corrupted data and analyses. This situation corresponds to scenarios 1 and 3.</p>
<p>Scenarios 2 and 4 are similarly easy to construct. Assume we have deployed
hackystat in ICS 111. Someone might want to make another user &quot;look
bad&quot; by adding additional defect or time data to their repository (or, they
may just dislike the person and want to take pleasure in &quot;hacking&quot;
their data into unusability.) Doing that is as simple as finding out their
enemy's hackystat username, changing their own environment variable to that
name, then doing things in the IDE to generate bogus data which will be stored
in their enemy's account.</p>
<p>The truly advanced student could even discover the SendNotification program
and use it to construct a simple program to flood their enemy's account with
bogus data. It is one small step from there to a denial of service attack on the
system as a whole.</p>
<p>So, that's the bad news. Now let me throw out some ideas for ways to address
some of these issues:</p>
<p>(A) Use the user's (presumably unique) email address to segment the user
namespace.</p>
<p>This is probably the simplest way to solve problems (1) and (3). We could
proceed as follows--REPLACE the environment variable hackystat_user (i.e.
&quot;johnson&quot;) with hackystat_email (i.e. &quot;johnson@hawaii.edu&quot;).
(Note that we are going to need the hackystat_email environment variable anyway,
so this is actually a net reduction in environment variable overhead). Then, we
send this email string along with each notification and use it to construct the
web server file structure. Instead of the current:</p>
<u>
<p><font COLOR="#0000ff">http://localhost/hackystat/users/johnson/logs/session/2001-06.xml</font></p>
</u>
<p>we would generate:</p>
<u>
<p><font COLOR="#0000ff">http://localhost/hackystat/users/edu/hawaii/johnson/logs/session/2001</font></u>-06.xml</p>
<p>This is a very appealing solution in some ways. First, it is simple to
implement for both developers and users and would appear to prevent the &quot;inadvertant&quot;
pair of problems quite well. Second, it allows users to maintain separate areas
for different jobs: johnson@hawaii.edu vs. johnson@hawaiimidwives.org for
example. Third, we could potentially generate hackystat_email automatically in
some environments (such as the ICS lab), making installation as well as usage
transparent to the user. Fourth, it would allow the site administrators to
easily collect demographic information about the user population and also
discover bogus usage.</p>
<p>(Note: the user will just have to assume that site administrators are
inherently &quot;trustworthy&quot; and won't use the information
inappropriately. One of the cool things about hackystat is that it allows
&quot;off-shore&quot; storage---some industrial developers might (correctly)
view CSDL as an inherently more trustworthy administrator than their own
company's sys admins.)</p>
<p>There are two issues that I can see with this solution:</p>
<p>(a) It doesn't solve problems (2) and (4).</p>
<p>(b) It aggravates problems (2) and (4).</p>
<p>It aggravates the problems because it's now even easier to guess the location
of your enemy's web pages, since their URL now has to correspond to a legal
email address. Once you have found their URL, you can construct their
hackystat_email and go to town. Under the current implementation, I could at
least make my hackystat_user variable to be &quot;dhjk8DCC4asd&quot; if I wanted
and get some measure of privacy/security that way.</p>
<p>(B) Combine (A) with password-protected notifications.</p>
<p>One way to address problem (2), i.e. intentional &quot;spoofing&quot; of
another person when sending data to the server, is to require a password.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, passwords are costly: they bring a whole lot of developer and
user overhead with them. Who generates the initial password? can the user reset
it? what happens if (when) they forget it? should it be put in an environment
variable? (Yes, because supplying a password even the first time a notification
is sent during a session seems intrusive and violates our prime directive. No,
because putting it in an environment variable makes it too easy for someone to
steal and violates the prime directive of passwords which is to never write it
down or store it in clear text.)</p>
<p>I worry that unless we are extremely clever about passwords, they will
increase the overhead of hackystat to the point that people won't want to use
it. And remember that &quot;zero-developer overhead&quot; is the raison d'etre
of hackystat.</p>
<p>(C) Combine (A) and (B) with password-protected web pages.</p>
<p>In a similar manner, and with similar costs, we could address problem (4),
intentional viewing of another person's web pages, by requiring a password in
order to retrieve the page.</p>
<p>So, there you have it. According to this analysis, the current implementation
leaves us open to four significant security/privacy problems. We can address two
of them easily, but that solution simultaneously increases the magnitude of the
remaining two problems.</p>
<p>Unless someone has a better idea, I think we should implement solution (A)
for the first operational release anyway. In the short term, only
&quot;friends&quot; will be using the system, and it does simplify user-level
installation.</p>
<p>If we could come up with a sufficiently elegant password scheme, we could
potentially design the system such that the administrator configure the
hackystat server to require password-protected notifications and/or
password-protected web pages on either a user-by-user or site-wide basis upon
installation. That would allow people to make their own decisions about how much
password protection they want to put up with.</p>
<p><b>Update:&nbsp; 7/18/2001:</b></p>
<p>As of the Final Fantasy release, the userName is replaced by userEmail, and we have implemented a &quot;Directory
Key&quot; mechanism: a 12 character randomly generated string that serves as
each user's &quot;home&quot; directory.&nbsp; This directory key is generated
the first time a user with a given email sends a notification to a given server.
Thus, the URL would look something like the following for a user:</p>
<u>
<p><font COLOR="#0000ff"><a href="http://localhost/hackystat/users/XU78Fder4nP2/logs/session/2001-06.xml">http://localhost/hackystat/users/XU78Fder4nP2/logs/session/2001-06.xml</a></font></p>
</u>
As long as directory browsing is disabled for the server in its server.xml file,
then this scheme does protect the privacy of users with respect to viewing their
data.&nbsp; 
<p>This 12 character directory key could also serve as the basis for a password
scheme if users wanted to prevent others from sending notifications with spoofed
userEmail values, but we have not implemented this. </p>
