<p>I was really pleased with yesterday's meeting and thought it might be helpful
to provide a summary. I spent a portion of the meeting reviewing the goals of
the project and then showing a demo of the current system implementation. In
essence, the current implementation shows how a &quot;sensor&quot; (in this
case, a simple GUI timer mechanism) can send a &quot;notification&quot; (in this
case, session data with start time, stop time, elapsed time, and files worked
on) to a server that accumulates the session data in an XML log file. The user
can retrieve that log file from a browser by simply typing in an URL: the XML is
reformatted via an XSL stylesheet for HTML presentation. There were a number of
excellent issues raised during the discussion that followed. Here's what I can
recall: </p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Issue: No matter how much you lower the overhead, for Hackystat to be
    effective, developers still have to _want_ to improve (and not all
    developers want that). </b><br>
    My reply: I agree. You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him
    drink. Hopefully, the lower the overhead, the higher the percentage of
    developers who _want_ to improve will be attracted to the system as a low
    cost _way_ to improve. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Issue: Automated data collection will introduce inaccuracies. Will they
    be severe enough to prevent the system from being effective? </b><br>
    My reply: Good question. I don't know. I think this is a fundamental (and
    fascinating) research question. It's critical that we design some
    experiments to address exactly this problem. Before we can do that, of
    course, we need to implement the sensors and so forth. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Issue: creating sensors is not easy; you need to know a lot about the
    development environment that you're attaching the sensor to. Plus, the
    development environments have bugs in their plugin APIs and they aren't well
    documented. </b><br>
    My reply: I agree. The best we can hope for with hackystat is to not require
    people to know a LOT about the plugin specifics for an IDE _plus_ a LOT
    about hackystat under normal conditions. As I showed, once you have gathered
    the data in the IDE, the act of sending it is only two lines of code. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Issue: But those two lines of code are in Java! What about Emacs Lisp,
    or Visual Basic, etc? </b><br>
    My reply: Well, yes. It turns out that with SOAP, it is entirely possible to
    write VB code to send off the data to be processed by a Java method on the
    other side. And, it even turns out that SOAP is really not that difficult to
    use either (I showed the SOAP Java code for processing a notification and it
    was about a dozen lines long.) And, there is a Microsoft implementation of
    SOAP (although rumor has it that this implementation is not totally
    compatible with the Apache SOAP implementation we're using.) For Emacs, my
    current intent is to create a small Java program that sends notifications
    with data given on the command line, which can be invoked as a forked
    subprocess. That is a simple, fast, and portable solution. The idea of
    writing a native Emacs Lisp SOAP implementation appeals to the Lisp hacker
    side of me, and I might get around to that at some point. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Issue: It seems to me that this system involves too much installation.
    I use a lot of different computers. Can't it just connect magically to the
    network? </b><br>
    My reply: Well, yes, it can, to the extent that _any_ application connects
    &quot;magically&quot; to any network. Note that there's really no such thing
    as &quot;magic&quot;, some system administrator somewhere always has to do
    at least an initial configuration of any software package. And the same is
    true for Hackystat. The approach is that there will be some initial, one
    time configuration required, but after that (hopefully) you won't have to do
    anything else. Of course, if the way you work is to always use a new
    computer every time you do any work, then the overhead of &quot;one
    time&quot; installation becomes prohibitive. I think for most people, they
    do most of their &quot;work&quot; on just a couple three environments, and
    the hackystat model is nice because it allows them to centralize their data
    in one place. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Issue: So what about when I'm using my laptop at the beach and not
    connected to the net? </b><br>
    My reply: Oh, don't worry about that---by the time we actually have this
    thing running in three weeks, there will be ubiquitous, inexpensive
    satellite network access and there will be no such thing as being &quot;off
    the net&quot; anymore. OK, seriously. In this situation, you would have to
    either (a) forget about data collection (that may be perfectly reasonable if
    you're only working a few hours or so), or (b) bring up a server and run it
    on your laptop to collect the data, then &quot;export&quot; the data from
    your local server over to your &quot;permanent&quot; server once you get
    reconnected. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Issue: You're writing out XML directly and not using a relational
    database server? That seems so unscalable and inefficient! </b><br>
    My reply: I know. I struggled with this myself. One thing I learned from the
    LEAP experience is that the more physical lines of code you have, the harder
    it is to understand and modify a system. From the Inca experience, I learned
    that it is complicated to maintain two representations---one object oriented
    (i.e. Java objects), and one relational tables (i.e. the database)---and
    translate back and forth between them. For the current initial
    implementation, I realized that I could reduce the number of lines of code
    dramatically, simplify the overall implementation, and allow the system to
    evolve much more quickly if, instead of having both an object-oriented and a
    relational representation, I just had ONE representation. My gut feeling is
    that we are going to make much faster progress on the important conceptual
    issues: how to design sensors, how to design analyses, etc. if our
    underlying infrastructure is lightweight. I will be very happy when the day
    comes that Hackystat is used so heavily that we need to move to a database
    (and by that time, perhaps the underlying representations will have
    stabilized enough that we can design an appropriate database model.) In the
    interim, I expect that once you spend a little time with the JDOM API for
    manipulating XML document objects in memory, you will find it to be a very
    enjoyable alternative to SQL. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Issue: Should we focus on developing a single plug-in (say, for time)
    on a lot of different IDE platforms, or should we focus on developing ALL
    the plug-ins for a single platform (say, for Emacs)? </b><br>
    My reply (actually, Cam's reply): Both. For Hackystat to be adopted, we need
    to provide both breadth (some kind of support for lots of platforms) and
    depth (lots of different plugins for a single environment). For the
    immediate future, I think we need to proceed using the &quot;scratch the
    itch&quot; development method---if you wish you had a hackystat-style
    capability on your chosen platform, then Go For It! <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Issue: Where did you get those cool hacky sacks? </b><br>
    My reply: $2.49 on sale at Longs Drugs in Kailua. But you don't need to buy
    one: I will give you a hacky sack each time you contribute a new sensor,
    analysis, or other component to the Hackystat project. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>Issue: So where do we go from here? </b><br>
    My reply: The good news is (modulo a ridiculous amount of frustration
    created by using command.exe rather than cmd.exe) that I was able to install
    the hackystat developer release on a new machine without any hackystat-related
    problems. What I want to do now is do a little more cleanup on the code (no
    matter how hard I try in Kawa to stop it from adding Tab characters, it
    still does it, so I need to manually remove them using Emacs) and so forth,
    and then I will create a developer's release .zip file and send out the URL
    to this list. At that point, I'd like to ask each of you to download it,
    install it, and read through the code for the entire system and send me
    emails with questions about code you don't understand (or consider to be
    totally lame). We'll go over the questions at the next meeting, which I
    expect to be next Thursday (next Monday is a holiday, and I'm trying to take
    national holidays off for once in my life.) </li>
</ul>
