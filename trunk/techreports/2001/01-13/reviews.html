<h3>PANEL SUMMARY:</h3>
<p><br>
This proposal describes Hackystat a technology initiative and research project
that explores the strengths and weaknesses of a developer-centric, in process,
and non-disruptive approach to empirical software project data collection and
analysis. Hackystat makes available to developers a set of custom sensors that
they voluntary attach to their development tools.<br>
<br>
Strenghts<br>
<br>
This is an interesting and intriguing proposal.<br>
<br>
The proposal should help accelerate the adoption of empirically guided software
project development.<br>
<br>
The PI's proposal is an outgrowth of prior NSF support. As such the PI has
required background and expertise to perform the research.<br>
<br>
<br>
Weaknesses<br>
<br>
How will the observations be accomplished and by whom ?<br>
<br>
The choice of the metrics is not justified neither is it firmly based on
existing software engineering literature.<br>
<br>
The possible &quot;analysis&quot; should be better defined.<br>
<br>
It is unclear what the quality of the data collected will be but this proposal
may shed some light on this issue.<br>
<br>
The budget is high and should be reduced.<br>
<br>
The proposal does not make any effort to involve minorities and underrepresented
groups.<br>
<br>
There is no statement on impact on curriculum.<br>
<br>

PANEL RECOMMENDATION: Competitive</p>
<h3>Review 1</h3>
PROPOSAL NO.: 0204045<br>
INSTITUTION: U of Hawaii<br>
NSF PROGRAM: SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU<br>
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Johnson, Philip<br>
TITLE: Accelerating adoption of empirically guided software development through
non-disruptive, developer-centric, in-process dta collection and analysis<br>
RATING:Good

<br>
Summary Statement<br>
<br>
This research project introduces the use of Hackystst for the<br>
collection and analysis of software project data. Hackystat<br>
provides sensors to collect data from developer's process.<br>
In my opinion, Configuration Management Systems and Problem<br>
Reporting Systems, which are widley used in industry, are<br>
significant sources of process data. The problem that I see<br>
is the lack of tools for metric extraction and analysis. some<br>
company already started and have such integrated tools.<br>

<h3>Review 2</h3>
PROPOSAL NO.: 0204045<br>
INSTITUTION: U of Hawaii<br>
NSF PROGRAM: SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU<br>
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Johnson, Philip<br>
TITLE: Accelerating adoption of empirically guided software development through
non-disruptive, developer-centric, in-process dta collection and analysis<br>
RATING:Very Good
<p>REVIEW:<br>
What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?<br>
<br>
This proposal describes Hackystat a technology initiative and research project
that explores the strengths and weaknesses of a developer-centric, in-process,
and non-disruptive approach to empirical software project data collection and
analysis. Hackystat makes available to developers a set of custom sensors that
they voluntarily attach to their development tools.<br>
<br>
<br>
The project is definitely interesting and innovative and should help accelerate
the adoption of empirically guided software project development. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
The PI's proposal follows directly from prior NSF supported research and its
related publications. As such the PI has the required background and expertise
to perform the research.<br>
<br>
Weaknesses:<br>
I am uncomfortable with the measures chosen. The PI does not clearly justify why
he chooses these measures and why not others.<br>
<br>
In the same way the &quot;analysis&quot; side of the application to be developed
could have benefited from further preliminary research and proof-of-concept.<br>
The criteria for validating the utility of Hackystat is: &quot; To validate the
utility of Hackystat, at least half of the randomly selected analysis results
should be reported as useful, and at least one quarter should have precipitated
change in developer activities&quot;. This criterion is too modest.<br>
<br>
What is the motivation behind the two groups of students (one with PSP and the
other with PSP and Hackystat). Does the PI consider that Hackystat should be
seen as a support tool to PSP mostly and as such won't be used without PSP?<br>
<br>
<br>
What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?<br>
<br>
The main contribution of the proposal will be to contribute insights into the
use and applicability of statistical process control techniques to
developer-centric in process project data.<br>
<br>
The proposal does not make any effort to involve minorities and underrepresented
groups.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary Statement<br>
<br>
If funded, the proposal will contribute insights into the use and applicability
of statistical process control techniques to developer-centric in process
project data.<br>

<h3>Review 3</h3>
PROPOSAL NO.: 0204045<br>
INSTITUTION: U of Hawaii<br>
NSF PROGRAM: SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU<br>
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Johnson, Philip<br>
TITLE: Accelerating adoption of empirically guided software development through
non-disruptive, developer-centric, in-process dta collection and analysis<br>
RATING:Good
<p>REVIEW:<br>
What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?<br>
<br>
The authors propose to implement a set of wrappers or plug-ins to an existing
software environment to collect data about the software process. &nbsp;Given
there is some interest in having this data, this seems like a workable approach
to at least cheaply and quickly gathering some of the information that might be
needed for project analysis. &nbsp;However, the types and completeness of the
data are going to be severely limited as the information available to the tools
is an incomplete subset of the information that would actually need to be
understood to measure and evaluate a software process.<br>
<br>
What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?<br>
<br>
Having a framework such as that proposed in place and validated would allow
managers to collect information about the software process to help in measuring
and predicting cost and performance.<br>
<br>
Summary Statement<br>
<br>
This seems like a reasonable albeit incomplete approach. &nbsp;The budget,
however, seems way out of line for the work that is proposed. &nbsp;A budget of
about 1/3-1/2 of that proposed would be more reasonable.<br>

<h3>Review 4</h3>
PROPOSAL NO.: 0204045<br>
INSTITUTION: U of Hawaii<br>
NSF PROGRAM: SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND LANGU<br>
PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Johnson, Philip<br>
TITLE: Accelerating adoption of empirically guided software development through
non-disruptive, developer-centric, in-process dta collection and analysis<br>
RATING:Good
<p>REVIEW:<br>
What is the intellectual merit of the proposed activity?<br>
<br>
Strengths: The proposed system, called HackyStat, provides a non-intrusive
approach that incorporates existing technology for collecting and analyzing data
during software development. The approach minimizes human intervention.
Automating metrics collection is difficult, and most current methods are costly,
inconsistent in its collection, and error prone. The work has the potential to
impact process improvement.<br>
The researcher is well qualified to complete the project. He has quality
publications in the area. In addition, he has had two significant NSF-funded
projects. Each resulted in tools. The second project extended the first project.<br>
<br>
Weaknesses:<br>
The analysis measures are not clearly presented. The proposer will use time
diaries and observation to verify the effectiveness of the sensors. The plan for
accomplishing direct observation is not articulated in terms of how observation
will be accomplished and by whom. In addition, the survey that validates the
activities should ask the user to enumerate at least one change that was made
based on the feedback from the system.<br>
<br>
<br>
What are the broader impacts of the proposed activity?<br>
<br>
Strengths: The work has the potential to impact the area of process improvement.<br>
<br>
Students will use Hackystat in classes. The data collected will be used in the
longitudinal study. In addition, the system will be used by the XP community.<br>
<br>
Weaknesses:<br>
The proposer did not explicitly address the broader impact of the research in
education. There is no statement on impact on the curriculum, although I assume
that there will be lessons developed on how to use the PROBE approach. No
indication on how this will affect participation of underrepresented groups.<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary Statement<br>
<br>
This proposal presents Hackystat, a tool that supports use of sensors that can
be attached to development tools and monitor characteristics of the developers'
processes and products. Collected data is stored to repository supported by a
web service. The researcher has a good track record. The proposed system builds
upon previous work and may impact the personal process improvement area by
providing a non-intrusive mechanism for collecting data. The usefulness of the
collected information needs more discussion in the proposal.<br>
