My thesis as PDF is available at
http://koa.ifa.hawaii.edu/~waterson/resume/resume2001.html

The text abstract and title are below; I have a printed copy in the mail
to you. I have also updated the link to my resume on the ICS website.
Hope the rest of the semester was calmer for you than me :-)

Title:
The Hardware Subroutine Approach to developing Custom Coprocessors

Abstract:
The Hardware Subroutine Approach to developing a reconfigurable, custom
co-processor is an architecture and a process for implementing a
hardware subsystem as a direct replacement for a subroutine in a larger
program.  The approach provides a framework that helps the developer
analyze the tradeoffs of using hardware acceleration, and a design
procedure to guide the implementation process.
To illustrate the design process a HWS implementation of a derivative
estimation subroutine is described.  In this context I show how key
performance parameters of the HWS can be estimated in advance of
complete implementation and decisions made regarding the potential
benefit of implementation alternatives to program performance
improvement.  Performance of the actual hardware coprocessor is compared

to the software-only implementation and to estimates developed during
the design process.
