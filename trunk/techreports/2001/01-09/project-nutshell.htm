<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000">The 12 basic requirements<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>Now that we have a pretty good idea of how uhmics functions, let's start to
specify the requirements for the Inca system.&nbsp; The first set of
requirements are taken from the current goals for the uhmics-based process,
although it is hoped that the Inca system can achieve these goals more
efficiently and effectively than was previously possible:</p>
<ol>
  <li><i>Provide approval codes only to qualified students.&nbsp;<br>
    </i>Inca enforces the prerequisites and other constraints (such as an A
    or B in ICS 111 or 211). Note that providing an approval code does not
    always guarantee a seat in the course, depending upon the time during the
    registration season when the code was provided.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Ensure that graduating ICS majors get an opportunity to enroll in
    courses needed to graduate.&nbsp;<br>
    </i>This does not mean a graduating ICS major gets every course they want,
    but an effort should be made to ensure they can graduate.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Provide ICS majors with priority over non-ICS majors.&nbsp;<br>
    </i>The Inca process will incentivize students to become and remain ICS
    majors.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Provide opportunities for lower-level students and unclassified
    graduates to enter into our program.&nbsp;<br>
    </i>Inca should help ensure that seats in ICS 111 are made available to
    lower-level students, and that unclassified grads have an opportunity to
    take some undergrad courses.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Provide opportunities for classified grads to make up undergrad
    deficiencies.&nbsp;<br>
    </i>Inca should again ensure that a small number of seats are made
    available for these students.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Make the approval process equitable, visible, predictable, and
    understandable to students.&nbsp;<br>
    </i>Inca should provide explanations for&nbsp; its decisions and
    procedures so that students understand (a) how a decision is reached, (b)
    when a decision will be reached, (c) what their chances appear to be, and
    (d) what other alternatives exist for them if their desired outcome does not
    occur.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The following requirements for Inca provide facilities beyond what is
currently provided by the uhmics-based system:</p>
<ol start="7">
  <li><i>Make historical data on a student's progress through the ICS program
    visible to that student.<br>
    </i>Inca should show each student exactly what courses they've taken,
    their grades, and other state with respect to their ICS program that is used
    in the course approval process. This enables students to check to see if the
    data upon which decisions concerning their enrollment is accurate (and to
    ask an administrator to correct it if necessary and appropriate.)<br>
    &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Allow students to order their request for next semester's classes.<br>
    </i>Many students have one course they want very to register in for a given
    semester, and others they are not so interested in.&nbsp; The current system
    does not provide an opportunity for students to express these preferences.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Provide fine-grained prioritization rules.&nbsp;<br>
    </i>Currently, course approval is based upon &quot;coarse-grained&quot;
    prioritization, which is essentially based upon categorizing the applicant
    into one of the seven flavors of student. Even after applying course-grained
    prioritization, there may still be many more requests for a course than
    seats available.&nbsp; For example, consider a popular course like ICS 451
    with 60 seats total.&nbsp; During the initial scheduled registration period
    for continuing students, 75% of those seats (45 total) might be available to
    ICS majors.&nbsp; However, 60 or 70 ICS majors might request an approval
    code for that course. Currently, uhmics makes these decisions on a
    first-come, first-served basis because any other scheme would require too
    much work.&nbsp; A potentially better strategy that is possible with Inca is to apply fine-grained rules, which would rank the set of
    applicants based upon their GPA, whether or not they are an ICS honors
    student, whether or not they have unsuccessfully attempted the course
    before, and so forth.&nbsp; Application of fine-grained prioritization rules
    not only has the potential to improve the quality gaining approval to our
    courses, but it also has an indirect effect of incentivizing our students to
    work harder in their current courses, since their current grades will have a
    direct impact on their ability to get into future courses.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Provide statistical data on requests for courses.&nbsp;<br>
    </i>The Inca system can easily generate reports on the number of
    requests made for specific courses, along with the number of seats actually
    available.&nbsp; Such information on the demand for ICS courses can help the
    department better plan for the future.&nbsp;For example, with knowledge of
    precisely how many students actually request ICS 111 and 211, as opposed to
    how many successfully register, and how these numbers change from semester
    to semester, we can provide to the administration much better data on the
    need for departmental resources.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Support notification of changes to courses and sections during
    registration.<br>
    </i>
    Quite frequently, new sections of courses open and others close during
    registration. The Inca system can be used to notify those who have
    requested a particular course that a new section has opened, for
    example.&nbsp; Such late-breaking changes can also be published on the Inca website for new arrivals.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><i>Above all, do no harm.<br>
    </i>Transition from a manual to an automated system introduces new risks:
    from malicious hackers to unexpected hardware and software crashes.&nbsp; As
    course registration is mission-critical to the department, safeguards must
    be put in place to ensure that registration can always succeed in some
    form.&nbsp; As an example safeguard, the Inca system should send an
    email message to a &quot;log&quot; email address (such as ics-Inca@hawaii.edu)
    each time a student completes a course request as well as each time the Inca
    system allocates an approval code. Such a mechanism provides both
    a secure record on a different system of the Inca actions, and
    preserves it in a form such that registration can be returned to manual
    methods quickly in the event of catastrophic failure of the system.&nbsp;</li>

      historical data and send email to the Inca administrator with
      requests to fix incorrect or missing information.
      <p>The system can begin to enforce prerequisites at
      this point, by enabling students to request only those courses for which
      they are currently qualified. It can also provide explanations to students
      as to why they are not qualified to request a certain ICS course.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Finally, the system can provide feedback to the students on the current
      number of requests that have been received for each course and the
      student's current &quot;position&quot; in line for that course, based upon
      their student flavor, the number of seats available, and their
      fine-grained prioritization.&nbsp; This helps students to predict in
      advance whether they are likely to get an approval code for specific
      courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
