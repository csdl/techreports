<!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>The primary way that the Inca system gives priority to students is by
their &quot;flavor&quot;: an ICS graduating senior always has highest priority
for selection of courses.&nbsp; Fine-grained priority rules are used to rank
students within a flavor, in order to reward better students with
greater influence over their course selection.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The concept behind fine-grained priority rules is to compute an integer value
that represents the priority of a student within a flavor for a course.&nbsp;
Then, if 20 students of a certain flavor all request a course and there are only
10 seats available, the seats can be offered to the 10 students with the highest
priority value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000">Rule representation<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>Each fine-grained priority rule is a function that takes a student and a
course request and returns an integer.</p>
<!--mstheme--></font>
<!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">

    <td valign="top" width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">An integer return value of 0 means that the rule does not apply to the

    <td valign="top" width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">A positive integer return value indicates that the rule applies to the
    student and course request, and that the rule should increase the
    probability of that student getting that course, with higher values
    corresponding to a higher increase in probability.&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="glabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">A negative integer return value indicates that the rule applies to the
    student and course request, and that the rule should decrease the
    probability of the student getting that course. Similarly, higher negative
    values decrease the probability more.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td>

<!--msthemelist--></table>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>Thus, to determine the priority value assigned to a single course request
made by a single student, the system simply applies all the rules and sums up
the resulting integer return values.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000">Rule examples<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>Here are some example rules. Each rule has two parts, the conceptual
&quot;goal&quot; of the rule, and the &quot;operational&quot; definition which
describes the algorithm by which the goal is achieved.&nbsp; Note that as we
gain experience with the system, we may redesign the operational definitions to
better achieve the goals.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Goal</b>: Students who are close to finishing their ICS degree have increased
    priority for those courses which enable them to finish their degree.&nbsp;<b><br>
    Operational definition</b>: Return an integer equivalent to the number of
    courses passed by the student. A student who has passed three ICS courses
    returns three.<br>
    &nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><b>Goal</b>: Students with a high GPA from completed ICS courses have increased
    priority, and students with a low GPA from completed ICS courses have
    decreased priority.&nbsp;<b><br>
    Operational definition</b>: Return an integer based upon GPA. If GPA &gt;
    3.5, return 5. If 3.0 &lt; GPA &lt; 3.5, return 3.&nbsp; If 2.5 &lt; GPA
    &lt; 3.0, return -3.&nbsp; If GPA &lt; 2.5, return -5.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><b>Goal</b>: Students who have taken a course previously and dropped (or flunked) have
    decreased priority for that course.&nbsp;<b><br>
    Operational definition</b>: Return -3 if course exists in student records, 0
    otherwise.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><b>Goal</b>: Students who were denied a course previously and are re-requesting it have
    increased priority.&nbsp;<b><br>
    Operational definition</b>: Return 3 if course request exists in student
    records, 0 otherwise.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><b>Goal</b>: Freshman and sophomores have increased priority for lower level ICS
    courses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><br>
    Operational definition</b>: Return 5 if course number &lt; 300 and student
    level is lower division.&nbsp; Return 0 otherwise.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><b>Goal</b>: Honors students have increased priority.&nbsp;<b><br>
    Operational definition</b>: If student is honors student, then return 5,
    else return 0.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
  </li>
  <li><b>Goal</b>: The student's first and second choices have increased priority.&nbsp;<b><br>
    Operational definition</b>: If this course is the student's first choice, then
    return 5.&nbsp; If it's the student's second choice, return 3.
    Otherwise, return 0.</li>
