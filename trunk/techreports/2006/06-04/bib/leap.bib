		  interfere with the intended results.  Dysfunction results
		  when metrics are used for motivation and not
		  information.  The difficulty is that once recorded the
		  use of a metric cannot be controlled.  Some suggested
		  solutions are to make the data anonymous, agragate the
		  data so managers can only see group data.  Individuals
		  can only see their data as it relates to the group
		  average and standard deviation.  Managers lose much
		  information, but gain confidence in the numbers?}
