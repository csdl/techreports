\begin{acknowledgements}

Philip Johnson, my advisor, thesis chair and mentor, provided the original idea to use the Jupiter code review system implementation as the thesis topic. I treasure our many conversations and admire your enthusiasm for producing a world class code review system.

Aaron Kagawa supplied a wealth of excellent feedback for my thesis and helped to find many grammatical errors.

The past and present members of CSDL, William Albritton, Honbing Kou, Qin Zhang, Mike Pauling, and Chiristoph Lofi, helped to make work and research fun. You provided an excellent sounding board that improved my presentation and thinking.

Dad and Mom, your love and support for my study of computer science at the University of Hawai'i at Manoa has made all of this possible.

I thank my committee members, Dan Suthers and Martha Crosby. Your precious time and support is greatly appreciated.
