Title: Results of a Pilot Study to Validate the Zorro System for Test-Driven Development Recognition
Using Software Development Stream Analysis.

Introduction
 - explain why low level developer behavior analysis is interesting. 
    - what are people really doing when they say they're doing TDD (for example) (or TSP, PSP, Scrum, XP, ....) 
 - explain why it's hard and requires automation.
    - but how do we verify that automated analyses really reflect reality?
 - introduce our approach: SDSA
 - introduce our domain: TDD
 - introduce our evaluation approach: ESR + analysis on data.
 - summarize results of our pilot study.'

An overview of Zorro
 - Hackystat
 - Jess
 - TDD rules
 - interface 

Evaluation methodology
 - goal: collect data on false positives, false negatives, uncaptured events, etc. 
 - approach: pre-pilot, assign simple TDD problem, gathered X hours of data from Y developers in lab.

Results:
 - example screen shots.
 - descriptive statistics.

Conclusions and Future directions
 - validation is important
 - example of triangulation
 - new insights into nature of TDD
 - next step is wider scale validation (bigger problems, non-CSDL people)
 - IF validation is successful, then we will use SDSA/Zorro to answer questions about TDD in practice.
