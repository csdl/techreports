  Measurement definition, collection, and analysis is an essential
  component of high quality software engineering practice, and is thus an
  essential component of the software engineering curriculum.  However,
  providing students with practical experience with measurement in a
  classroom setting can be so time-consuming and intrusive that it's
  counter-productive---teaching students that software measurement is
  ``impractical'' for many software development contexts.  In this
  research, we designed and evaluated a very low-overhead approach to
  measurement collection and analysis using the Hackystat system with
  special features for classroom use. We deployed this system in two
  software engineering classes at the University of Hawaii during Fall,
  2003, and collected quantitative and qualitative data to evaluate the
  effectiveness of the approach.  Results indicate that the approach
  represents substantial progress toward practical, automated metrics
  collection and analysis, though issues relating to the complexity of
  installation and privacy of user data remain.
