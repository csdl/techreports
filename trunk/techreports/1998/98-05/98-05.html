<A name=introduction>
<H2>I. Introduction</H2></A>

<P>Since its inception at CERN, the World Wide Web has been 
intended as a means for real-time collaboration. The desire to collaborate with 
other around the world formed the backbone of this project, and so the primary 
level of the WWW has been to share information with others. However, the methods 
in sharing information have never been standardized, and most likely never will 
be. It is only with a mix between research and trial-by-error that one can 
provide an effective web site that can functionally share its information with 
people all over the world.</P>

<P>It was natural for a group that concentrated on 
collaboration to use a service that was also based on sharing information. The 
Collaborative Software Development Laboratory (CSDL) initially published their 
page during the first generation of web site design. In the early days of the 
World Wide Web, most information was simply listed in one large page. These 
sites did not concentrate too much on the structure of the site, or the design 
of the pages contained within, as the major point of the WWW was to share one's 
information. The CSDL page had a simple listing of research projects 
accomplished by the group, as well as reference points to the many publications 
written by the group. Due to the lower modem speeds and bandwidth issues, a 
minimum of pictures were used, including only the organization's logo and a 
group photo.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, as web site design evolved over the 
years, the CSDL web site did not change along with it. Its layout, which was 
effective in the early-nineties, was greatly outdated, and the overall feel of 
the site was monotone and uninteresting. The content of the site was also 
outdated, as many new projects were not included in the site, and there was no 
mention of the group losing and adding members during the years. As the web page 
began to take a new role over the years--that of exhibiting an organization's 
identity, it was apparent that a change had to be made to the site. The neglect 
of the web site now had the ability to cause a negative impression of CSDL to be 
formed by visitors, and this needed to be resolved.</P>

<P>The Aziza design group (formally 691 Web Development 
Team) was commissioned by CSDL to implement a new web site. The group was 
assigned not only to update the entire site, but also to research and 
investigate the process and life cycle of World Wide Web site development. This 
examination into the various methods involved would then become one of CSDL's 
own research projects.</P>

<P>The updating of the CSDL web site would be used as the 
basis of this research document. Issues such as the balance between providing 
information and providing an image of the group would be discussed and examined, 
and ways to share research information over the World Wide Web would be studied. 
To back the data researched, evaluations by the various users of the site would 
be conducted and examined. This document records our web site design processes, 
what insights we had about those processes, our findings, and finally, our 
conclusions.</P>

<A name=planning>
<H2>II. Planning and Information Gathering</H2></A>

<P>The Collaborative Software Development Laboratory is a 
highly prolific organization. In the years that it has existed, members have 
literally turned out thousands of pages of HTML and documentation. Despite this, 
though, the design group's first urge was still to sit down and immediately 
create a web page. It was quickly realized, however, that to be able to complete 
the web site in a relatively short amount of time (one semester) some 
organization was required. Before the thought of designing pages could be 
considered, an overview of the project would be needed. To this end, a Software 
Requirements Specification was created.</P>

<H3><A href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06/98-06.html">Software Requirements Specification</A></H3>
<P>The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) gave a 
point to start from and outlined the group's goals; it directed all actions 
through the entire design and construction of the site. The SRS was comprised of 
several informational parts: an overview of the CSDL site as an organization, an 
evaluation of the then-current CSDL site for its strengths and weaknesses, an 
evaluation of similar research and development sites for their strength and 
weaknesses, a determination of the uses and users of the new site, a 
determination of the goals that the new site should meet, and finally, 
guidelines for designing the new site. This process, although several weeks 
long, was well worth the effort.</P>

<P>By collecting information on <A href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06/98-06.html#orgContext"> the CSDL organization</A> and <A href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06.html#overviewCSDLSite">evaluating the then-current site</A>, the Aziza design 
group familiarized ourselves with the structure of CSDL and the nature of the 
information that would need to be organized. The organization of the current 
site gave an idea, at least in part, of how the updated site might be 
presented.</P>

<P>Doing evaluations on both CSDL's site and <A href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06/CRSsurvey.html">
other similar sites</A> focused attention on what good 
ideas other web sites were employing and also provided first-hand experience 
with some ideas and formats not to use. Information that was just as valuable to 
know as the former.</P>

<P>To determine the uses and users of the new site, the 
group interviewed each member of CSDL. These 
<A href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/Aziza/SupportDocs/prelimSRS/691prelim.html"> interviews</A> clarified what the customer (the CSDL 
members) expected out of the site - who they thought would use it, the 
information that they wanted available through the site, and a basic idea of how 
that information was to be presented.</P>

<P>With all of those things in mind, the group developed 
the web site's 
<A href="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06/98-06.html#functReq">functional requirements and design guidelines</A>. The 
purpose of these were to give the group a direction to go in with the 
development of the new site. Spending time early in the project to get a good 
idea of what the new web site was required to provide eliminated doubling back 
and extra work due to forgetting any needed functionality.</P>

<A name=design>
<H2>III. Design of the Site's Layout</H2></A>
<P>After completing the SRS, the group had a fairly good 
idea of what information the site was to contain, but it was still amorphous. 
The lines along which CSDL's information would be divided and presented were not 
yet articulated. To formalize those decisions, the group created several schemas 
related to the various sections of the site.</P>

<H3><A href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/Aziza/SupportDocs/info/schemas.html">Schemas</A></H3>
<P>For this project's purposes, schemas were detailed 
listings of the required information for each element of the site. Determining 
these lists moved the project along on several levels. First, it necessitated 
the decision of what sections the site would have, i.e., a section on Members, a 
section for research projects, a section for software tools, etc. This called 
for a careful consideration of the categories in order for the CSDL site to have 
a firm semblance of structure without being too rigid. It would have been 
extremely bad design if adding something to the site called for its 
restructuring. At the same time, it was not desirable to create a miscellaneous 
section just to have a place to put everything that would not conveniently fit 
into the available categories. Secondly, the decision of what information each 
section would contain provided a template for each section, meaning that each 
instance of a section would have a formalized structure and an organized, 
uniform feel.</P>

<P>Overall, the schemas provided an overview of the logical 
structure of the site. It allowed a visualization of the interlinkings of the 
different sections and gave a short listing of all information which would be 
provided. Once the schemas were completed, individual Aziza members were 
assigned to put together different informational pages. For instance, Jennifer 
was assigned to complete the member page of Carleton Moore and the research 
pages for his projects. Although the layout of the site was not yet complete, 
the schemas told us what information was needed and how it would be organized on 
the page.</P>

<A name=development>
<H2>IV. Development of the Site's Layout</H2></A>
<P>The development stage of the project concentrated on 
formalizing two things - navigation and message. While a bad navigational system 
is never desired, an appropriate one can add an extra dimension to the 
represented organization. Consider how appropriate it would be for an art dealer 
to organize their site as an art museum; each wing dedicated to a different 
style, each room dedicated to an individual artist. From this illustration one 
can see how closely layout and theme are tied and also how a fitting or 
complimentary theme can strengthen the overall impact of a site.</P>

<P>Because the layout of the site was such an important and 
key element, the best way to decide on a system was to prototype different 
ideas, and present these to the group for feedback. These prototypes gave the 
CSDL members something concrete to look at and think about. In this manner, the 
group was able to show the look of various options, such as frames versus no 
frames, and different types of navigational schemes.</P>

<H3>Pre-coding Prototypes</H3>
<P>The first navigational scheme ideas were limited to 
paper. Each member of the Aziza group brainstormed extreme ideas of web page 
design without any regard to the work involved. The main idea was to obtain as 
many ideas as possible, from classical and mainstream, to avant-garde and wacky. 
It was possible that the group would decide against using any of the first few 
prototypes, but the real purpose was for everyone to present their best ideas, 
running the gamut from one extreme to the other. As the group examined the 
different navigational paradigms, it was agreed that the more outlandish ones, 
while being greatly liked, would prove to be too difficult to upkeep, and so 
initially a traditional &quot;side-link&quot; design was chosen.</P>

<P>The first request by <A href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Members/PhilipJohnson.html">Dr. Philip Johnson</A>, the &quot;manager&quot;, was for the 
incorportation of a large photo as the background of the main page. This photo 
would have clear separations of sky, mountain, sand, and water; each 
element/section of the picture would correspond to a different section of the 
web site. This particular idea did not survive, as the group decided that there 
was a need of more than four sections in the site, and creating a viable image 
map would be nearly impossible, due to the different video resolutions 
available.</P><BR>

<H3>Alpha Prototypes</H3>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>

</TD>
<TD>
<P>Instead, The Aziza design group decided to 
            use half of the suggestion: using a large photo as the background. 
            The first prototype consisted of multi-colored buttons, based on 
            standard colors defined by the W3 organization. The initial idea was 
            to have a side bar of buttons, where the background of the side bar 
            corresponded to the button selected. This would enable the user to 
            know which section they were in, giving both functionality and color 
            to the site. However, this scheme proved to be too gaudy, and the 
            group rejected it almost immediately after prototype 
    completion.</P>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>
<P>The next prototype used the same idea of 
            multi-colored buttons, but in a frame format. The idea of having the 
            entire background as a large picture was dismissed, and a tiled 
            background was used instead. More things were added to this 
            prototype, such as a logo and more wording, but all still felt that 
            there was great room for improvement.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<IMG SRC="alpha2.jpg" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=232 ALT="Alpha Prototype 2"> 
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The feeling at this point was that thinking together as 
a group was leading nowhere, and so the group decided to split up and come back 
with four different ideas from which we might choose from. One idea included 
using pictures as the back of the buttons, and having a neutral background for 
the rest of the site. Another idea used an applet that would provide pop-up 
menus corresponding to the button that the mouse pointer was over. This applet 
was well received by both the group and Dr. Johnson, so this idea would be 
expanded in future prototypes. </P>

<H3>Beta / Delta Prototypes</H3>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>
<P>The group experimented on different ways of 
            using the navigation buttons as a location indicator, but none did 
            as well as the original applet method. Another avenue of design came 
            forth at this point - the idea of using an antique aloha shirt 
            design as the background of the buttons. The design wrapped across 
            the buttons, and an antique-looking script was used as the font. 
            Despite the fact that this design issue had nothing to do with 
            navigation, all agreed that it looked better than the original 
            button set, and so the decision to expand on these buttons was made. 
            The group used this new site layout along with the java applet, and 
            all felt that the development was coming along nicely. </P>

<TD>
<P>A new point, however, was brought up during 
            the presentation of this layout - that of screen real estate. When 
            looking at the main page from a browser running 640x480, the buttons 
            filled over 1/3 of the screen, which was unacceptable. To solve this 
            problem, it decided to greatly shrink the buttons and put them on 
            the top of the screen rather than down the side. The aloha-shirt 
            design was used again, but use of a different font was needed in 
            order to fit on the smaller buttons.</P>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>
<P>The group felt that they were close to 
            finalizing the site design, but Dr. Johnson introduced a new design 
            issue--that of having a site map on the screen for navigation. The 
            group implemented this, using the Delta1/Top button prototype, and 
            adding a list of links along the side of the screen. The prototype 
            was presented to Dr. Johnson and the group waited on his approval.

<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="gamma1.jpg" WIDTH=288 HEIGHT=223 ALT=""></TD>
<TD>
<P>An email was sent out by Dr. Johnson to the 
            group, discussing his new vision for the site. Instead of choosing 
            between top navigational buttons and a side site map, the two were 
            to be blended together into one. The CSDL banner was to be removed, 
            and replaced by a logo. The site map was to appear on the main page, 
            giving it a functionality other than that of a welcoming screen, 
            while the navigational buttons would remain at the top of all other 
            child pages in the site. Furthermore, the Comic Sans font was to be 
            used throughout the site, matching the many posters which were made 
            by CSDL. The group agreed on these ideas, and implemented it in time 
            for a presentation to the CSDL group.</P>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>During this meeting, some design aspects were brought 
out by the group members. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the site was 
the large picture background, the only design element that had been retained 
from the original alpha prototypes. It was agreed upon that the picture was too 
&quot;tourist bureau&quot;-like, and gave the wrong first impression. This 
picture also made it very hard to read the text, and so the task of finding a 
new background picture was made definate. The buttons were also scrutinized, and 
a request for better buttons was made. Because of the changes to the site, the 
aloha-shirt design did not fit in anymore, and so these were disgarded. </P>

<H3>Final Touches</H3>
<P>The new CSDL site design was almost finalized, with only 
some minor graphical enhancements to be changed. The logo was redone, first 
using CorelDraw to edit the original .cdr file and include the name of the 
laboratory. This was then exported into Photoshop and shrunken, keeping both the 
clarity of the logo, and the compression of the JPEG format together. The 
buttons were also changed, discarding the original design of the aloha-shirt 
background. The group saw the problems of having only selected and unselected 
buttons, so a &quot;focus&quot; indicator was added to our buttons. This 
indicated if a user was in a section, but not necessarily at the main page of 
the section. Several prototypes of these buttons were made, and an oval design 
was finally chosen. The group also decided to obtain better background pictures, 
and these were chosen from the collection of Douglas Peebles, a professional 
photographer. His permission to use his pictures on the CSDL site was approved, 
and a script was run to rotate these pictures daily. Finally, the decision to 
retire the Comic Sans font from the web site was made. While being popular among 
some group members, and Dr. Johnson, the font took up too much on-screen real 
estate, and was not very readable in large blocks of text. It was agreed that 
the font specifications be left up to the user's browser.</P>

<DIV align=center><IMG SRC="final.jpg" WIDTH=360 HEIGHT=281 ALT=""></DIV>

<P>As of this writing, the CSDL web site design consists of 
oval buttons at the top, with a rotating picture background. This site layout 
has evolved greatly from our original vision, yet the first idea for the site is 
still in place: the photo background. Although some of the more innovative ideas 
thought up in the beginning were not used, it was learned that design of a 
navigation tool for a web site involves not only the look of the graphics, but 
also the functionality and ease of upkeep for the site administrator. In an 
organization where no one is able to devote their time to upkeeping a site, as 
is the case with CSDL, the graphics should be simple and easy to edit.</P>
<A name=construction>
<H2>V. Construction</H2></A>

<P>Once the final layout for the site was developed, the 
group was able to get down to the actual building of the new site. Each member 
of the group had individual assignments of which members, projects, and areas of 
the site they were to work on. This allowed everyone to work on our own. What 
this meant, however, was that communication was crucial. Miscommunication could 
have created inconsistencies, leading to double work fixing mistakes. The time 
spent working on the SRS, schemas, and etc. would have been for naught.</P>

<P>In an effort to avoid this, our group posted everything 
it could think of. In this way, all information was always available. The time 
spent was worth it - especially if a member missed a meeting. With everything 
available on-line, the member could easily and without hassle, catch up to the 
rest of the group. Following are the types of documents that we utilized to keep 
group communication flowing:</P>

<H3><A href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:/Research/Aziza/SupportDocs/691meet.html">Meeting Notes</A></H3>
<P>Each week the Aziza group had anywhere from one to four 
meetings. One of the weekly meetings was a class meeting in which the group 
would meet with Dr. Johnson. The rest of the meetings were group meetings, where 
the group would get together and iron out project details. Because a great deal 
of information was discussed during each one of these meetings, it was 
invaluable to have the meeting notes posted on the web. It allowed us to go back 
and review decisions at any time of the day or night.</P>

<H3><A href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:/Research/Aziza/SupportDocs/691todo.html">&quot;To Do&quot; Lists/Deadlines</A></H3>
<P>While each meeting was described in detail, it was 
useful to have a location to keep a &quot;laundry list&quot; of things to do. 
There was a To Do list for each meeting in which assignments were handed out. 
The To Do lists had areas for members to insert a &quot;Yes&quot; once a given 
task was completed. These provided an overall view of both what had been done 
and what was left to do. It also served as a reminder for who was doing what 
assignment - occasionally there were times when we would become confused over 
who was responsible for what task and looked to the To Do lists for 
clarification.</P>

<H3>General To Do List</H3>
<P>The General To Do List was put together as the project 
neared its close and the things left to do could be listed. Its content was 
added to as things were found that needed to be done and updated as they were 
completed. Having this list and watching as its items were checked off gave the 
group a feeling of accomplishment. Each item that was completed was one step 
closer to a finished web site.</P>

<H3>Monthly Calendars</H3>
<P>As the project came to a close, deadlines came due 
quicker and more frequently. Monthly calendars gave us an overview of when 
things were due in relation to each other. Seeing all of the deadlines on a 
monthly calendar helped to reinforce how crucial time management would be in the 
last few months.</P>

<H3>Hours</H3>
<P>Each member of our group kept an accounting of how his 
or her hours were spent on the project. During the project, it was a useful 
gauge for how much or how little was accomplished for the week. These summaries 
also showed in black and white how efficient the group or individual was. If a 
lot of hours were recorded, but there was little work to show, then something 
needed to be changed. Conversely, if relatively few hours were being recorded, 
but a lot was accomplished, then there was an ego boost for the week.</P>

<P>At the end of the semester, keeping the hours allowed 
the group to view how time was divided between the different types of work and 
how the work level had its varying high and low points. Keeping this accounting 
brought home how the type of work changed throughout the project's life time. 
About half way through the semester we needed to re-define the time categories 
that had previously been designated.</P>

<H3>Standards</H3>
<P>The following documents were put together for the 
purpose of coordinating the work methods of four different people. As mentioned 
earlier, one of the toughest parts of team projects is communication, especially 
communication of standards. Without standards, it is far too easy to spend time 
re-doing work that could have easily been done in the correct format the first 
time. It was for this reason that standards for our work were created.</P>

<H3>Standards - Site Standards</H3>
<P>These refer to general HTML writing standards that the 
group tried to adhere to while writing the individual pages. This not only 
included the nitty-gritty of HTML writing, such as using relative links instead 
of hard-coded links, but also examples of standard headers and footers to be 
used.</P>

<H3>Standards - Templates</H3>
<P>As noted before, each section of the CSDL site had a 
schema written up for it. Since each instance of a section category, such as 
each member's page, was to contain generally the same information, it was 
natural to have produced template pages that contained the basic structure of 
each type of page, pre-formatted and only waiting for content to be filled in. 
This cut down considerably the amount of writing that would otherwise have had 
been done and also on any content inconsistencies.</P>

<H2>VI. Site Maintenance</H2></A>
<P>Trying to maintain a site (even a small one) is a 
never-ending task. The site adminstrator is forever fixing broken links or 
adding and changing the contents of the site. Because of this, the Aziza group 
dedicated a section to site maintenance.</P>

<H3>Man Pages</H3>
<P>In the FAQ section of the CSDL site, there is a 
question/link titled &quot;How do I update the site?&quot; Under this link is an 
index of Manual Pages. This is a listing of pages that give instruction on how 
to maintain the site: from moving a member to the Ohana section to restarting 
the server, they provide instruction and information on how to do it all.</P>

<P>This section was created because the process of 
maintaining a site can often be involved and sometimes confusing. By providing a 
checklist on how to do things, whomever is the maintainer does not need to have 
intimate knowledge of the inner working and inter-linkings of the entire CSDL 
site. They just need to have a fair knowledge of HTML and UNIX commands and can 
quickly update the site with confidence that they are not missing or forgetting 
something.</P>

<H3>WebTester</H3>
<P>There is also an installed a utility, WebTester 1.05, 
that checks for broken links and orphaned files on a site-wide basis. It runs 
nightly and automatically posts its' error results under the FAQ page's 
question, &quot;What are the results of the most recent link check on the CSDL 
site?&quot; It is an easy way to keep the site running error-free and 
smoothly.</P>


<A name=testing>
<H2>VII. Testing</H2></A>
<P>Usually, testing and evaluation are combined issues. In 
respect to the CSDL web site, however, the two have been seperated. In this 
case, testing refers to internal evaluations such as goal achievement and a few 
technical concerns.</P>

<H3>Previous Site Versus Updated Site</H3>
<P>One method of testing the new site's qualities is to 
compare it to the previous site. Following is a brief evaluation of the old site 
and a listing of the improvements made by the new site.</P>

<H3>Previous Site Versus Updated Site - Evaluation of Old 
Site</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>Strengths.</B> The major 
    strengths of the previous CSDL web site were its speed and abundance of 
    information. The loading of the main page was very quick because the ratio 
    between text and graphics highly favored text. Information on the major 
    projects were quickly accessible through links near the top of the page. 
    Navigating through these links provided a great amount of information 
    regarding not only the projects, but also the general ideas behind CSDL.
<LI><B>Currency.</B> The previous 
    site had not been revised for some time - since August 28th, 1997 - there 
    were many broken links, missing graphics, and orphaned pages. Also, the 
    bottom group picture contained many members who were no longer an active 
    part of CSDL.
<LI><B>Unimpressive 
    appearance.</B> The site did not take advantage of newer technologies that 
    the web offered. It appeared that colors had been abandoned and design was 
    almost non-existent leading to an unfinished feeling; as if plain text had 
    been converted into HTML to get the pages posted.
<LI><B>Readablilty.</B> Most pages 
    consisted of plain text across the screen, or lists of documents. The use of 
    headers, at a minimum, could improve the portrayal of information. Further 
    changes, such as fonts, sizes, and columns, could help to improve page 
    layout. 
<LI><B>The site as a recruiting 
    agent.</B> The site may have been considered &quot;boring&quot; to some 
    members of CSDL's audience. Since one of the primary goals of the web site 
    is to attract new members of CSDL, the low tone of the site may have been 
    detrimental to accomplishing this task. There was nothing in the site that 
    indicated a desire to sign up new students.
<LI><B>Feeling of 
    non-collaboration.</B> The site contained an immediate branching into the 
    projects. This created a feeling of disjointedness been the pages. Each seem 
    to have been written and organized differently from the other, giving an 
    ironic twist to the goal of &quot;collaborative&quot; software development.
<LI><B>Lack of organization.</B> 
    The last link in the Projects section included a primer which was comprised 
    of a lot of informative documents on CSDL and information on how the group 
    operates. However, this inclusion in the Projects section seemed out of 
    place and may have been hard to find when being sought for by a viewer.
<LI><B>Publication lists.</B> The 
    previous site expedited finding the technical documents by dividing the 
    documents up into different categories, such as by author or by subject. 
    However, these links were not complete and the Master List was very long, 
    making it hard to search through, and tedious to load.
<LI><B>Search engine.</B> There 
    was no search engine or means to search the site.
<LI><B>Lack of member 
    visibility.</B> The way that the site was organized, members were second in 
    order of importance to the projects - information about them were sub-linked 
    into the project sections. </LI>
</OL>

<H3>Previous Site Versus Updated Site - Improvements</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>Top page.</B> The original 
    site had a top page that contained two major &quot;sections&quot;: one with 
    links to seven projects and one with links to publication indexes. Besides 
    being out of date, this organization was superficial and incomplete. The 
    current top page provides six major sections with over 50 links. The page is 
    up to date with double the number of research projects. It also provides 
    &quot;first class&quot; status to members, affiliates, and software tools 
    produced by the site, providing a much fuller representation of the mission 
    products, and relationships of CSDL with other groups. Furthermore, the 
    top-page is organized such that it prints out in one page: i.e. it occupies 
    about the same amount of space as the old one!
<LI><B>Navigation.</B> The old 
    site had only a single navigation link from interior links back to the top 
    page. The current button-based navigation bar can take you to any of the six 
    major sections.
<LI><B>Search.</B> The old site 
    had no search mechanism. The current one has a nice search facility with 
    pre-built keywords.
<LI><B>Page formats.</B> The old 
    site had no common representation for information. The new site provides 
    template structures for each type of information (research project, software 
    tool, member page), that help ensure the completeness and consistency of the 
    information. In addition, the research template is consistent with the ISERN 
    format.
<LI><B>Addition of java-based 
    tools.</B> The new site is designed to enable CSDL java-based tools to be 
    used from a browser-based interface, using the servlet mechanism.
<LI><B>Section summary pages.</B> 
    The old site jumped from the top level into the details. The new site 
    enables people to obtain: 
    <OL type=a>
    <LI>an overview of CSDL by reading just the 
        top-level page. (1 page)
    <LI>a more detailed overview by reading just the 
        top-level page and the single page section summaries (7 pages)
    <LI>even more details by looking at the research, 
        software, member, etc. pages.
    <LI>the most detailed view by following links from 
        (c) to reading actual technical reports, design pages, etc. </LI>
    </OL>
<LI><B>Project and tool 
    distinction.</B> The new site makes a critical structural and semantic 
    distinction between the tools produced by CSDL and the research produced by 
    CSDL that may involve these tools. The old site mixed these separate issues 
    together.
<LI><B>Sponsors/Affiliates.</B> 
    The old site made no mention of sponsors/affiliates. The new site makes them 
    first class members.
<LI><B>Site evaluation.</B> The 
    new site contains an evaluation of its design and effectiveness, thus making 
    itself a research project. The old site didn't. </LI>
</OL>

<H3>Meeting Functional Requirements</H3>
<P>Another way to internally test the success of the new 
site is to look at the functional requirements that were listed in the SRS and 
the ways in which their achievements were approached.</P>

<P>This is a listing of the main point of each of the 
functional requirements and an accompanying discussion on how they 
addressed:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Present CSDL as an 
    organization that has produced and is producing high-quality research and 
    software and is composed of interesting, friendly people.</B> 
    <P>This was indirectly addressed by creating a Research 
    section, a Software Tools and Tools section, and a Members section. The 
    Research section brings attention to the fact that CSDL is a <I>Research and Development</I> group. Having a distinction between 
    Research and Software Tools and Tools emphasizes that CSDL is not just a 
    bunch of students who got together to write programs. They are a collection 
    of graduates, undergraduates, faculty, etc. who perform valuable research 
    and who produce marketable products. The members section brings personality 
    into the site and provides a formal area where the group members can 
    represent themselves.</P>

<LI><B>Provide up-to-date 
    information about all group members.</B> 
    <P>Each member has their own page in the site. Once 
    they are no longer members of the group, they can be moved to the Ohana 
    section. In effect this takes them off the active research list, but does 
    not cut them off from the group.</P>

<LI><B>Organize information in 
    such a way that a user is not overloaded by too many choices or too much 
    information on a page, yet is not required to follow one given path or ten 
    links to find a certain page.</B> 
    <P>The site was designed with the intention of having 
    an even layering of information. All of the navigational pages (the main 
    page and the summary pages) not only provide links, but also provide a lot 
    of summarized information. If more detail is needed, the user has to merely 
    click on a desired subject.</P>
    <P>There is also a strict navigational system 
    implemented throughout the site. Each of the pages in the first three levels 
    (main page, summary pages, pages linked to from the summary pages) has a 
    top-situated navigation bar. The buttons on this bar provide direct links to 
    the main page and the summary pages. In all pages throughout the site, 
    except for the main page, there is also a bottom-situated text navigation 
    bar. It provides the same links to the main page and summary pages. Linking 
    only to the main and summary pages provides a low-cost, controlled, yet 
    still flexible, way to navigate throughout the site. It also sends the user 
    to a position in the site where they can quickly re-orient themselves if 
    they happen to get lost or come to the CSDL site via an inner-page.</P>

<LI><B>Make all existing CSDL web 
    pages and technical reports accessible from a single home page. At present 
    there are many HTML pages in the CSDL directory that are orphans or 
    grand-orphans. These need to be discovered, organized, and linked in.</B> 
    <P>All pages in the CSDL site are accessible in some 
    way or form through the main page. The WebTester's service provides a daily 
    listing of of broken links and orphaned pages that can be used as a 
    reference when maintaining the site.</P>

<LI><B>Present all information on 
    attractive pages that are visually unified and easily navigable, without the 
    use of large or distracting graphics. Every graphic should have a purpose 
    that is clearly explained and/or easily understood. No one feature should 
    overpower any other and every thing must lend itself to heightening the 
    readability of the information.</B> 
    <P>As of this writing, the CSDL site uses one 
    relatively large graphic for the background of the navigational pages. This 
    does, however, have a purpose. For one, it shows off one of the advantages 
    of joining CSDL - the possibility of working in beautiful Hawaii. Secondly, 
    the graphic is faded enough so that it is not overly distracting and 
    provides that &quot;something&quot; that distinguishes the CSDL site from 
    others. Moreover, the graphic disappears from anything deeper than the 
    navigational pages, replaced by a background of a solid, complimentary 
    color.</P>

<LI><B>Provide applet-based 
    interfaces to some CSDL systems such as JWiz, JavaLOC, JavaDiff, Mako, and 
    Honu to provide &quot;community services&quot;.</B> 
    <P>A mechanism has been provided where community 
    services, such as JavaWizard, can be run. A java web server has been 
    installed on Natasha to safely run services without the security hassles 
    previously faced on www.ics. Within the site, adding a service function to 
    an existing project was designed to be a simple process.</P>

<LI><B>Provide a flexible search 
    mechanism for locating technical reports and web pages by author, topic, 
    keyword, word in title, and year.</B> 
    <P>Searching the web site has been given its own 
    section. However, it does more than just search for technical reports. It 
    does site-wide searches on any word or words that the user chooses and also 
    provides several sets of keywords that the user can choose from to help 
    direct their search.</P>

<LI><B>Design pages in such a way 
    that they are search engine friendly. This will involve using the META HTML 
    commands for each page that we would like a search engine to be able to 
    find. We also need to submit the main pages to search engines.</B> 
    <P>We have not met this requirement.</P>

<LI><B>Present CSDL projects in 
    such a way that the ISERN relationship is explicit and in a format similar 
    to projects presented on-line by other ISERN organizations.</B> 
    <P>The general outline of each research page follows 
    the ISERN standard. Also, if a project has an ISERN affiliation, it is noted 
    in the Participants section of the research or tools page.</P>

<LI><B>Promote CSDL's activities 
    within ISERN by providing ISERN-related links.</B> 
    <P>Each research page contains a section where 
    participants are listed. If the project has an ISERN affiliation, it is 
    noted there. Also, ISERN is represented in the site's Affiliates section. 
    There is a link to the ISERN home page provided in that area.</P>

<LI><B>Show with logos, CSDL's 
    affiliation with other organizations such as DEC, ISERN, Tektronics, NSF, 
    Worldpoint, PICHTR, and Makai Ocean Engineering.</B> 
    <P>All industry partners and affiliates are given their 
    own section called Affiliates. This section contains their logos and a short 
    description of the nature of their affiliation with CSDL.</P>

<LI><B>Produce instructions for 
    maintenance of this site after the 691 Web Design Group has moved on.</B> 
    <P>There is a question under the FAQ section, called 
    &quot;How do I update the site?&quot;. It links into the manual pages index 
    - a listing of help pages that gives a breakdown of how to update and 
    maintain the site.</P>

<LI><B>Incorporate active 
    information about the process of developing the web site.</B> 
    <P>This document is one of the many that relate to the 
    design and development of this web site. The 
    <A href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:/Research/Aziza/Aziza.html">Aziza research project</A> is dedicated to documenting 
    a case study of WWW Research and Development site development.</P>

<A name=siteeval>
<H2>VIII. Site Evaluation</H2></A>
<P>Site evaluation of the updated CSDL site was handled in 
two different ways. One way was to hold in-depth interviews, or interviews in 
which members of the Aziza development group physically sat down with an 
evaluator and led them through the site. The second way was through a 
questionnaire sent out via e-mail asking for 10 minutes of the reviewer's time - 
5 minutes to be spent looking around the site, and 5 minutes to send back the 
reviewer's first impressions.</P>

<H3>In-Depth Interviews</H3>In the SRS, there were six 
different user groups defined for the CSDL site. For evaluation purposes the 
Aziza group held an in-depth interview with at least two representatives from 
each of those user groups. We expected each group to be especially interested in 
a specific two or three sections of the site and modeled each interview to draw 
out information regarding those particular sections. Following is a table 
listing the user group and their sections. Please note that Non-CSDL ICS 
Students and ICS Students at other Institutions have been grouped under the 
general heading &quot;Students&quot; because they would probably have similar 
primary-interest categories.

<P>Each interview followed this general outline: 
<OL><LI>Find out how much they know about CSDL. 
    <LI>Their first impression of the page. 
    <LI>Have they ever visited the old site? 
    <LI>Ask them to find the link to their first section of 
    interest as shown in the table above. Once there, ask them for their 
    impressions:
        <OL><LI>enough info?
            <LI>too much info?
            <LI>is it clear?
            <LI>is it interesting?
            <LI>any other comments</LI></OL>
    <LI>Ask them to find the link to their second section 
    of interest as shown in the table above. Once there, ask them for their 
    impressions:
        <OL><LI>enough info?
            <LI>too much info?
            <LI>is it clear?

    <LI>If applicable, do the third section of interest in

    <LI>Let them play around and get whatever comments they 
    give us.

<P></P>

<H3>In-Depth Interviews - Response Summaries</H3>
<P>Comments from the in-depth interviews were consolidated 
and grouped according to subject. The responses/comments were: 
</P>

<B><P>Background Image</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>Background is good, attractive, but a little hard 
    to read.
<LI>Background is nice to keep the eyes from getting 
    tired.
<LI>The background is OK.
<LI>Likes the background. The photo is nice, not 
    distracting. Very grabbing.
<LI>Likes the background picture, says it makes the 
    text stand out. He doesn't like pages with plain backgrounds. Says it draws 
    attention down and makes you want to scroll down. Feels that it is not too 
    intrusive, but is interesting and soft.
<LI>Likes the rotating picture idea.
<LI>Likes the fixed background (demo done using IE).
<LI>&quot;I love the background picture. It adds an 
    extra dimension - I just love it&quot;.
<LI>Didn't notice the background picture until she 
    started scrolling and it didn't move.
<LI>&quot;That's nice, now that I'm looking at it. Very 
    pretty. Very soothing.&quot;
<LI>&quot;The background is muted enough.&quot;
<LI>The small font size does not compete successfully 
    with the background image.
<LI>Might consider using background images as a 
    navigational aid. A different background image used throughout each section 
    of the site.
<LI>On graphics...might be nice if the background on 
    some of the secondary pages was different. </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The response on the background image of the CSDL web 
    site was overwhelmingly positive. Although we expected this issue to be more 
    controversial among the reviewers, there were no outright negative comments 
    about including a large picture as the background of the site. A few of the 
    interviewees did not notice the background picture initially, showing that 
    the pictures were not overwhelming. Most of the others agreed that the 
    background picture added another dimension to the site, either just being 
    something nice to look at, or even as a way to get the viewer to scroll down 
    the page. Another interesting point gained from these interviews were that 
    some interviewees had similar ideas to concepts that were suggested during 
    the design phase, notably that of using background images as a navigational 
    aid. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>FAQ Page</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>He thought the FAQ was really nice. &quot;I loved 
    the first bullet and the logical outline. So many FAQs list questions in the 
    order in which they are received or added to the page instead of logically 
    grouping them&quot;.
<LI>&quot;This is nice. You have a lot of stuff in 
    here. Now what is this about Cherry Garcia? Now this I *have* to look 
    at&quot;. The mention of Asian Cuisine at the top of this page also caught 
    her eye as she was moving to another page, causing her to go back for a 
    second look.
<LI>&quot;Hey, this page is cool...even tells you how 
    to configure your UNIX environment.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Usually, FAQ questions lack the key words 
    that get the user to know whether that is the link that they should 
    follow...these [questions] are really good.&quot;
<LI>Liked that page was organized by topics.
<LI>New member orientation is good. </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A lot of praise on the FAQ page was given for its 
    organization and content. Not only did the page provide useful information 
    on CSDL and related topics, it also piqued interest because of the clarity 
    and tone of the writing contained within. It seems that most interviewees 
    had been disappointed by other FAQ pages encountered upon the web, either 
    because of their disorderliness or their boring tone. The extra time spent 
    on organizing the CSDL FAQ page seems to have paid off in providing a 
    positive image of the organization.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Member Pages</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>The term &quot;ohana&quot; was not clear to him - 
    says if we use Hawaiian terms that we should put English explanations in 
    parentheses.
<LI>Danu's picture is bad. Should retake the picture 
    ASAP.
<LI>Pictures on the personal homepages look blurry 
    around the person's head except for Jay's picture.
<LI>Likes the pictures with names very much. Feels that 
    he kind of knows these people now, and that if he were to call CSDL up he 
    would have &quot;a better feeling - I would hold back less and be more 
    inclined to communicate freely&quot;.
<LI>There was enough information, there was not too 
    much information, it was clear, it was interesting.
<LI>When asked for any other comments, she said that it 
    seemed as though the order of the sections was wrong, and that it would be 
    more appropriate to have: Professional Experience, Publications, 
    Presentations, Software, Skills, Education.
<LI>He says that the depth of information provided made 
    CSDL members &quot;exquisitely recruitable&quot; and that there was 
    definitely &quot;enough [information] to target&quot;. (comment from a 
    recruiter)
<LI>He said the Members page with the sunglasses was 
    &quot;offputting&quot; at first, until he went to the individual pages and 
    saw pictures without the sunglasses &quot;It's probably a good idea, 
    actually, you should keep it&quot;.
<LI>Members need to have address, phone number and 
    e-mail link on the individual pages. If the page is downloaded as a resume 
    page, it does no good to have the information only on the main page.
<LI>As far as &quot;fit and finish...the member pages 
    get right up there with a picture and the important information&quot;.&quot;
<LI>She was concerned that the picture could make it 
    difficult for someone trying to comply with EEOC regulations since it 
    divulged race and gender. She especially liked the LEAP description 
    &quot;This is nice. I like this section. This is the kind of thing I would 
    be interested in [as an employer]. If he wrote this himself it shows that he 
    is at least literate. You wouldn't believe the mistakes you see on some 
    resumes and the terrible English&quot;.
<LI>&quot;EEEK....what is wrong with Danu's 
    picture?&quot;
<LI>&quot;What the heck is with the shades? hehehe...so 
    is this like how engineers try to act cool even though the whole world knows 
    that engineers know way too much calculus to be cool...?&quot;
<LI>&quot;I like the history...i.e. the short info on 
    when each member came to CSDL and their contact information.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Maybe you need to play with the color table 
    on Danu's picture.&quot; </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Several comments referred to the pictures taken of 
    the CSDL members. Using pictures of the members in sunglasses on the Member 
    Summary Page seemed to provide a comedic break in amongst the technical 
    information provided throughout the site, somewhat relaxing the user. One 
    thing to consider is that since EEOC regulations require the disregard of 
    race and gender in employment, the pictures may make a recruiter to skip 
    over these pages, in an effort to avoid a potential problem. However, one 
    interviewee stated that the pictures made him more comfortable in 
    communicating with the members, which could be a positive point when 
    recruiting.</P>
<P>A particular comment that appeared several times 
    referred to Danu Tjahjono's picture, in the &quot;ohana members&quot; 
    section. All of the pictures in the ohana section were sent in by the member 
    themselves, and Danu's picture was not of the same color depth and 
    resolution than the others. It seems that most users expect consistency 
    across the web sites, so when one object is different from the others, it 
    draws a lot of attention. This can be used positively, as in drawing the 
    user's attention to a particular point in the page, but if this result is 
    not purposely done, it can seem out of place.</P>
<P>Most interviewees felt that the amount of 
    information provided on the individual pages was of the right length; it 
    gave enough information to target them as potential employees without being 
    too long to read. Some suggested small changes to the individual members 
    pages, such as a different ordering of categories, or address / phone number 
    information. </P>

<B><P>Navigational Bar</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>&quot;The menu buttons have a nice effect on 
    showing which [section] you are in...
<LI>If you had the navigation bar as a frame on the 
    side then you wouldn't need one at the top and the bottom, and you would 
    never need to scroll to get to it.
<LI>Good for telling you where you are [in the site]. 
    </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Of the three comments received on the navigational 
    bar, two were positive statements about the use of &quot;focus 
    indicators&quot; in the site. This seems to indicate that users not only 
    want a quick method to accessing areas of the site, but they also wish to 
    know where in the site they are at that time.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>On-line Service</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>Likes the star (for JWiz) because it draws 
    attention, but feels that it is then unclear what the rest of software tools 
    are - what are they if they aren't on-line services?
<LI>&quot;That's very helpful!&quot;
<LI>&quot;What's an on-line interface?&quot;
<LI>It is good to show some demo programs. </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Half of the comments received on the on-line 
    services were of confusion on what an on-line service actually was. This 
    could be due to either poor word choice of the Aziza group, or due to the 
    lack of similar services on the WWW. Taken positively, this would mean that 
    the CSDL site could be a forerunner of service-based web sites, something 
    that is only starting to be used today.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Research Pages</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>There was enough information - told exactly what 
    the research was, gave good examples.
<LI>There was not too much information, were not 
    overloaded.
<LI>On the AutoFAQ research page: It was clear except 
    that more clarification was needed that the research had not actually been 
    done yet.
<LI>On the BRIE page: &quot;What does that stand 
    for?&quot; There was nothing on the BRIE research page that clearly 
    explained the abbreviation.
<LI>On the Research summary page: &quot;Good for a 
    person who knew what they were looking for.&quot; </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The interviewees who viewed the research pages 
    seemed to be split up into two groups--those who knew previously about the 
    research projects, and those who had no prior knowledge. This brings up a 
    point in research web site development: providing content for more than one 
    audience. It is sometimes hard to find the correct balance between 
    explaining your information to new visitors to your site and not insulting 
    current members or affiliates of the group. Future work should be done to 
    the research pages to give a little more background information for those 
    who have no prior erudition of the topics involved.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Scrolling</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>Opening page should fit on one screen, especially 
    the pages with rich graphics. Scrolling [on those pages] is not attractive 
    to users with slow computers and modems.
<LI>Wish that everything was visible on the 
    navigational pages without scrolling.
<LI>On the publications page: &quot;Seems as though it 
    could all fit on the same page.&quot; This was referring to her dislike of 
    scrolling navigational pages.
<LI>On publications split by research project: You have 
    room, so you should spread out the publications table out more.
<LI>His first impression was that the main page was 
    very long. He said he was browsing on a laptop with a 12 inch screen and for 
    him, a &quot;friendly page means one that is complete on the screen&quot;.
<LI>The first page was so long that &quot;Members&quot; 
    did not appear on the first screen at all. He explained how as a headhunter 
    he spends two or three hours a day surfing the net for prospects and that 
    despite the presence of the individual pages he would have skipped over our 
    site altogether in his normal work mode. For his purposes, the names should 
    be first in the site map. </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Of all the issues regarding the look and feel of the 
    site, the scrolling of the pages was received most negatively. Although not 
    everyone had something to say about the scrolling, those who did stated that 
    they disliked it. Unfortunately, the amount of information included within 
    the CSDL site made it very difficult to prevent scrolling. One way around 
    scrolling is to have the page split up into multiple one-screen pages, but 
    this would take even longer to view than if the page scrolled. Some sections 
    will continually grow larger, such as the publications section, and so 
    reformatting of a page in order to have it fit on one screen is 
    unreasonable. Another point to keep in mind is that the web is not the same 
    as a desktop publishing mechanism. One cannot insure what the visitor to the 
    site will be using as a browser, and therefore no one will know how the page 
    will look on the visitor's screen. Because of the nature of HTML, this issue 
    will have to be unresolved until new standards are made regarding the 
    formatting of pages. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Search Engine</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>Should have two search engines: One detail and one 
    quick search. Have the quick search located on the first page.
<LI>When he goes to a page, he does not wander around. 
    He likes to go straight to the documents containing his interests. The 
    search engine is very helpful in this case.
<LI>Search engine is very helpful in locating 
    information.
<LI>Visited the search page and liked it very much. 
    &quot;You guys are really thinking out there. Nice. Very nice!&quot;. Liked 
    the keyword lists. &quot;Cool!&quot;
<LI>When searching for information on Danu: &quot;I 
    expected to see his picture come up next to his page information.&quot; 
 </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The search engine seemed to be a good addition to 
    the CSDL web site. Because of the large amount of information located in the 
    site, a search mechanism was needed to allow users to find specific pages 
    related to their interests. One interviewee stated that the page should have 
    another search engine on the main page, an idea that was removed from the 
    final layout. It was assumed that since the search engine was one link away 
    from the main page, that a second search mechanism would be redundant and 
    costly for on-screen real estate. This is not necessarily the case with all 
    users--those looking for information quickly would appreciate the time saved 
    by having the search mechanism on the main page. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Main Page / Site Map</P>

<UL>
</B><LI>&quot;Academic sounding. It's a little fuzzy just 
    exactly what you do.&quot; There are over 40 hot spots on the first screen 
    plus text, that is too much information.
<LI>He prefers the map rather than links. (Changing 
    color of links once the link has been visited).
<LI>He likes the index on the left (good for people 
    with slow connections and provides the information that he would want to 
    look at to find out more about CSDL).
<LI>He likes the menu on one side separated from the 
    general text.
<LI>&quot;That yellow star is really hard to see 
    against that background [in the Software Tools section].&quot;
<LI>&quot;I almost understood the star as a sign that 
    something was new - how do you know what is recent?&quot;
<LI>It would be nice if you had a &quot;new!&quot; 
    label so you could tell when something has been added. </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>One interviewee seemed to want the differentiation 
    of the main page from the site map in order to make it less overwhelming. 
    The original purpose of including the site map on the main page was to give 
    it some importance rather than it being just a prosaic, introductory page. 
    It was hoped that those who were interested in the introduction of the site 
    would disregard the site map, and vice-versa, but this was not the case for 
    all. However, others appreciated the site map being on the first page, 
    allowing for a fast way of navigating around the site. One interviewee even 
    mentioned specifically the separation of the site map from the rest of the 
    main page, showing that most users view the page as being made up of two 
    distinct items.</P>
<P>The star used in the Software Tools section was 
    distracting for some, either by being hard to see, or by being similar to 
    icons used on other pages to represent new items in the site. When designing 
    new sites, it is always wise to consider current standards used in other 
    sites. Using something such as an icon in a different context can be 
    confusing for the user, and in this case, also bring something to mind which 
    the user may feel is lacking, which was a &quot;new!&quot; label in the map. 
    Future revisions of this site should find a better replacement for the 
    yellow star, as well as considering adding a &quot;new&quot; label to the 
    site map section.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Software</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>She felt that we almost needed to 
    &quot;advertise&quot; the various software products. She personally would 
    have liked to see the number of people who were using or who had downloaded 
    each product and would have like to read quotes from users of the software, 
    rather than just our descriptions.
<LI>&quot;There is absolutely nothing missing from [the 
    Egret research page]. It is excellent...at first I thought, so when are they 
    going to mention that source code is included in the distribution and then 
    they did, and then i wanted to see what the interface looks like and it was 
    there!&quot; </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Although one interviewee felt that the research 
    pages were fully complete, another wanted the group to advertise the 
    software available. This may be very helpful when looking for new 
    affiliates, or new users, and a nice way of showing feedback from users. 
    Future revisions of the site should include user comments on the software 
    packages as a minimum.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Software Download Form</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>Shouldn't have the mechanism ask for an email 
    address before the download. Make that an option after download. People will 
    give a fake address anyway if they don't want to disclose their email. 
 </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The practice of requiring a pre-registration before 
    a download seems to be annoying to most users. It may be better to request 
    registration rather than to force it, providing download information and not 
    irritating users of the site.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Third-level Graphics</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>There is no need to have graphics in the 3rd level 
    and below. People going down to that depth would not care about the layout, 
    just interest more in the information [that] it provides. People should be 
    getting tired of pictures by then.
<LI>3rd level pages are ok. Graphics are not important 
    at that level. 3rd level and down are fine. Page should only contain 
    information. Graphics would be distracting at those levels, clustering the 
    viewer's attention. </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Some interviewees felt that graphics on the third 
    level of the site should be removed. While it is true that those who would 
    actually go to this level would not be demanding of the images, the Aziza 
    design group felt that the inclusion </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><P>Overall</B> </P>

<UL>
<LI>Organized.
<LI>Better layout. Easier to find information than on 
    the old site.
<LI>More professional [than the old site].
<LI>Attractive.
<LI>[Would be] nice if you had a guest book.
<LI>It was clear.
<LI>It was interesting.
<LI>[He] felt that it could increase his knowledge.
<LI>When asked what his impression of CSDL was after 
    looking over the site for about 20 minutes: &quot;If I joined, it would be a 
    lot of tough work - but that's a Good Thing. People there seem very free 
    about giving information and help.&quot; All-in-all, he thought the site was 
    well thought out. &quot;The people that did the work on this took the time 
    to do it right and to do it well.&quot;
<LI>On a powerpoint presentation &quot;That was really 
    cool. Really slick. Nice colors, that's very nice.&quot; She thought having 
    on-line PowerPoint presentations made our site stand out.
<LI>&quot;Well organized&quot;. &quot;It's easy to get 
    around&quot;.
<LI>States that this site would make a difference to 
    her as an employer. &quot;A great tool for a student. It would be a great 
    thing to put on a resume, 'See www.blah.blah.blah'&quot;.
<LI>He suggests that we provide our pages to such 
    services as headhunter.net, Career Mosaic, and ESPAN. These are where he 
    spends a lot of his net time, and would have found our member pages only if 
    he was in &quot;highly precise targeting mode&quot;. (comment from a 
    recruiter)
<LI>&quot;You need to try to find ways to relate the 
    research and software projects to what is real and familiar to people who 
    are slightly outside your specific areas of research. Don't use general 
    terms. You need more specific examples of people using various things.&quot;
<LI>&quot;Overall, I'd rate this [site] a 100 on user 
    ease of navigation.&quot;
<LI>&quot;If just surfing, I want to quickly jump in, 
    get something, and jump out. If motivated, then I would sit down and read. 
    If I am already mentally committed [to really looking at the site], then I 
    am motivated [to read.] Chunking your data can't hurt.&quot; </LI></UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Overall, the comments were very positive regarding 
    the new CSDL web site. Of those who had seen the previous site, all agreed 
    that the new site was a major improvement. The site was commended on various 
    aspects, including the look, design, and content. Some offered some 
    suggestions in improving the site, such as submitting it to career service 
    web sites, and making the content more user-friendly. Altogether, however, 
    the site portrayed a good image of CSDL as well as the Aziza design group. 
    </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<P>It seems that the overall sentiment is that the site is 
pretty good, but that there is still room for improvement. Depending on who the 
reviewer was, the type of improvement differed, however most of the suggestions 
were things that could easily be implemented and would improve the quality of 
the CSDL site for its users - for example submitting the site/the member pages 
to head-hunter services.</P>

<P>There was an area though, that while not a great point 
of contention, did greatly bother the people that it bothered (i.e. either they 
didn't care at all or they really cared). This was scrolling navigational pages 
or even scrolling pages in general. Many reviewers did not comment on the 
scrolling, but those who did were quite firm in voicing their preference for 
non-scrolling pages.</P>

<H3>First Impression Interviews</H3>
<P>As mentioned earlier, there were two means of evaluation 
utilized: (1) in-depth interviews where the interview was person-to-person, then 
(2) first-impression interviews where all communication is by e-mail. The 
following e-mail message (or a form very close to it) was sent out to 
approximately 300 potential CSDL site users:</P>

Subject: 10 Minute Research Help Request


Greetings, colleagues,

We are concluding a one-semester project on research web site design,
and would like to request 10 minutes of your time to help evaluate
our efforts. As part of evaluation activities, we are interested
in soliciting &quot;first impression&quot; data.  Could you please:

(a) Spend five minutes surfing the new Collaborative Software
    Development Laboratory web site at:

       http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:/

(b) Spend five minutes replying to this email with short
    answers to the following questions:

   1. What is your first impression of the site's layout/presentation?

   2. What is your first impression of the site's content?

   3. What is your first impression of the CSDL research group?

   4. What do you feel we should change or improve in this site?

   5. Would you like to be emailed a pointer to the technical report
      on the results of this project when it is completed?

Thanks very much for your participation. If you could reply within the
next 48 hours, that would be most helpful.

<H3>First Impression Interviews - Response Summaries</H3>
<P>About 50 responses were returned, roughly 1/6 requests. 
The responses are summarized as follows, grouped by common subject matter:</P>

<B>Site design, graphics and layout </B>
<UL>
  <LI>Nice, attractive, grabbing
  <LI>It looks pretty good. Must spend some time in 
    designing it.
  <LI>Much better than the old one.
  <LI>Exciting images, yet make the text somewhat hard to 
    read
  <LI>Well organized, clean
  <LI>Very easy to find things and jump directly to the 
    items
  <LI>Does not have the &quot;cluttered&quot; feel that 
    many web pages have nowadays
  <LI>About the group members' picture wearing shades:<UL>
      <LI>Loved the 'company uniform' with the shades
      <LI>The pictures of everyone wearing shades are 
        pretty funny and sneaky. Yet a few others dislike this idea.
      <LI>Not very helpful to recognize people wearing 
        sun glasses.<BR>
      </LI>
    </UL>
  <LI>Close-up pictures have an eerie feel to them
  <LI>Nice colors settings for the page.
  <LI>Nice sitemap, very helpful.
  <LI>The site is user friendly due to the easy accessing 
    of pages
  <LI>Pretty positive.
  <LI>Very easy to navigate, and could tell what was 
    going on at a glance
  <LI>&quot;When not loading the images, the box lines 
    cut off the text in the banner so you can't read it. I know it's hard to do 
    but I hate it when I can't read it. Then I tried to load the images and only 
    half of them came through. I don't know if that's you or me, but it's never 
    happened before&quot;
  <LI>&quot;I find that web page designers waste way too 
    much effort trying to get the layout &quot;just right&quot;, when it really 
    doesn't seem to matter much (except for perhaps about 2% of web sites)&quot;
  <LI>Nice, yet the images size needs to be smaller. It 
    took 3 minutes to load the page on 33.6 kps modem.
  <LI>&quot;The background, by the way, is very subtle on 
    my computer {PowerMac running Netscape} and not essential if it delays 
    load.)&quot;
  <LI>Prefer the buttons on the side if possible.
  <LI>Buttons are nice.
  <LI>The font color of the text as well as the unvisited 
    links of it does not show too much contrast to the BG color - blue text 
    against blue background, a bit irritating to the eye.
  <LI>&quot;The light blue makes me a bit sleepy though 
    :)&quot;
  <LI>Background photos seem to be tiled - not good - 
    they took too long to load
  <LI>Like the layout of &quot;Research&quot; page. Not 
    only do I have the project name but I immediately have a description, 
    contact, and a date without moving to a &quot;text only&quot; document. This 
    is a very nice feature and quickly allows me to navigate to the site that 
    best suits my needs.
  <LI>The layout is very clean and readable
  <LI>It is hard to understand the abbreviations in the 
    menu to the left.
  <LI>Mountain background isn't tall enough and I get 
    this weird underworld mountain sticking up beneath it. Brings to mind ideas 
    of Hades.
  <LI>Redundancy within the buttons in the top and the 
    options in the left.
  <LI>Like the &quot;pushbutton&quot; images and the way 
    that various sections have a uniform layout/style
  <LI>Prolific
  <LI>Good job. Now if only the ICS web site was half as 
    good.
  <LI>The refresh rate when you scroll down the home 
    page. It might be my machine but it doesn't do that at other sites. 
    It&rsquo;s real jerky.
  <LI>From the home page, in the blue box that has the 
    member summaries and the individual members when I selected your name, the 
    transition to your site took an inordinately long time with a pink colored 
    background inching down my screen.
  <LI>The first time I did this I ended up re-booting my 
    computer because I thought the time it was taking was a function of my 
    computer seizing up. The second time I did it, it did the same thing. I 
    don't think it&rsquo;s a memory thing with my computer. The site was not 
    terribly complex with lots of graphics - just a small photo of you and the 
    rest was text. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The suggestions are focused on the site's design and 
layout. They are very constructive and helpful comments for future web designers 
to consider and reformat the site accordingly during the optimization of the 
site.More than 90% of the surveys indicates the site's overall layout, design 
and graphics are well-defined and attractive. The site is organized, clear 
making the site is very easy to navigate. However, the graphics on the first 
page is intensive and it takes approximately 3 minutes for loading on a 33.6 kps 
modem. This is an issue that we are all aware of, yet could not find the best 
solution. The main load is derived from the background picture, yet reducing or 
fading colors meaning reducing the picture quality. This concern among other 
comments is an example of an item in our &quot;To Do List&quot; for the 
optimization of the site. </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>First impression on site&rsquo;s content </H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Very informational
  <LI>Compact, dense
  <LI>Adequate for most purposes.
  <LI>Affiliate section is great
  <LI>&quot;The &quot;research&quot; and 
    &quot;software&quot; sections seemed to be rather repetitive (AEN/LEAP, 
    etc.). I realize that there were some things that weren't, but that was 
    still the impression I was left with.&quot;
  <LI>&quot;Member section still a little thin; for 
    example, from the summaries page I expected, when clicking on names to see 
    more info (&quot;I like to surf,&quot; &quot;my hobbies are,&quot; 
    whatever)&quot;
  <LI>Seems pretty comprehensive and has some value to 
    the interested browser, i.e. software that can be downloaded plus papers 
    that can be downloaded.
  <LI>&quot;Is a &lsquo;browser-based interface&rsquo; 
    any different from a browser? Does the word &lsquo;interface&rsquo; really 
    add anything? It seems to be used throughout the page as a noise-buzzword.
  <LI>Too many acronyms
  <LI>I particularly liked:<BR>
    <UL>
      <LI>the format of the research summaries.
      <LI>the fact that the &quot;Research&quot; page 
        listed the active period of various projects
      <LI>the FAQ for new group members </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>

<UL>
  <LI>&quot;I was a little disappointed to find that many 
    publications weren't available from the web site&quot;
  <LI>The names of the software are not suggestive.
  <LI>More information on personal web pages.
  <LI>Provide downloads for J-wiz and the others
  <LI>Hi-Time very interesting
  <LI>Too much content is in the first page
  <LI>&quot;I did read through some of the FAQ. I got 
    through the first three levels of the CSDL Maturity .... model (I forgot the 
    exact name). The first two levels made sense to me. I started reading a 
    description of the different languages (?) and what you should be able to do 
    with them in order to demonstrate competency in them and I got lost.
  <LI>the understanding of the first page contents is not 
    visually immediate. &quot;Textual comments on this page&quot; window 
    encapsulating the textual part could probably help to have a more immediate 
    communication.
  <LI>The summaries at the beginning of each sub-section 
    give a further overview. I really liked this multi-layer approach
  <LI>The FAQ idea is brilliant and would make it so much 
    easier for a new person coming into the group.<BR>
  </LI>
</UL>

<P>Regarding the aspect of site's content, our surveys 
shows that almost everyone agreed that the site is very informational. This is 
the goal and also requirement that CSDL members and web designers have been 
trying to push during the design and construction of the new site. Some of the 
sections in the site such as FAQ, Affiliate gave a major good impact on viewers. 
There were also some issues that the site web designers should notice. The first 
concern was about the acronyms and abbreviation used for projects' name. Viewers 
felt uncomfortable because some of the abbreviation do not have explanations of 
what they stand for. One approach to correct this is to dedicate a section in 
every research page explaining about the meaning of its name. The second issue 
was about the length of the first page. More than a few of viewers felt that the 
first page should be simple and visible without scrolling. Is it a personal 
preference or a web standard? This is the question that requires web designers 
to do more researching and changing accordingly.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>Impression on the site as a whole </H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Good for luring prospective CSDL'ers
  <LI>Simple, yet elegant
  <LI>The introduction makes viewers want to look at all 
    those neat acronyms and names on the left side of the main page.
  <LI>It is good to have a search engine. Very helpful.
  <LI>Up to date (according to the last-modified line) 
    which is a good look.
  <LI>A nice research web page -- not too much flashy 
    presentation, big lists of software and papers.
  <LI>This is clearly a busy group. There are a lot of 
    projects going on, but most projects seem to have only on person working on 
    them. The group has a clear sense of humor, but obviously (as the content of 
    the web site indicates) takes research &ndash; particularly the _process_ of 
    research - very seriously

<P>The comments in this section are key points that we are 
looking to determine the success or failure of our semester project of web 
design. The comments have proven the fact that our design of the site met the 
functional requirements we had set out at the planning stage earlier in the 
semester and our efforts putting into this project have been award. &quot;luring 
prospective CSDL'ers&quot;, &quot;providing a good overview of the group&quot; . 
. . are the goals that the site web designers have been trying to achieve. </P>

<H4>First impression of CSDL Research group after visiting 
the site </H4>

<UL>
  <LI>It seems like there are interesting research going 
    on.
  <LI>There's quite a bit of research projects happening 
    there
  <LI>Small, but doing a lot.
  <LI>Sounds like CSDL does a lot of cutting-edge 
    development
  <LI>Knowledgeable of subject(s)
  <LI>&quot;The CSDL faculty is strong, at least Johnson, 
    Jay and Russ are there.&quot;
  <LI>&quot;I cannot say - in my mind it depends on more 
    than a smartly presented set of web pages - I am not a particularly strong 
    proponent of the 'perception is reality' school of thinking!&quot;
  <LI>The researches are impressive.
  <LI>A software engineering group.
  <LI>&quot;As a fellow faculty member at UH and someone 
    who is interested in software development methods (from the Business Mgmt 
    perspective), I'm happy to know you guys exist. During my 2 years at UH, 
    I've been holed up in my office and really knew nothing about your center or 
    activities. Since there might be some overlap / mutual interests, I think 
    the site is valuable as a way of making yourselves known. It seems like 
    you're doing and have done some interesting work.&quot;
 <LI>Looks like a bunch of smart individuals trying to 
    find solutions for useful things (rather than high-end stuff that doesn't 
    apply to the average surfing Joe).
  <LI>closely-knitted but very active, knowledgeable and 
    well-connected research group
  <LI>Viable organization with good outside support. Not 
    too big, about the right size to get something done.
  <LI>Well focused.
  <LI>Very productive and energetic group.
  <LI>Group achieved a right balance between working on 
    products and processes
  <LI>&quot;A handsome, learned, widely published, 
    brilliant associate professor, P.M. Johnson&quot;
  <LI>&quot;I didn't realize you'd been published so much 
    and done all those presentations and lectures and everything. I am totally 
    impressed! And here I thought you just lounged on the beach all day! </LI>
</UL>

<P>The comments in this section shows the site's ability to 
organize and convey the essential information about CSDL researches to viewers. 
From browsing, viewers could get a good overview of what has been done for the 
last 7 years and most of viewers were surprised of how much researches happening 
in the group. The site has demonstrated a very good image of the group to the 
world as being a very productive, energetic and knowledgeable group. The 
comments in this section could have a major influence on the CSDL's future 
expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<H4>Suggestion on site improvement</H4>

<UL>
  <LI>The word &quot;Ohana&quot; on the Members page is 
    OK in Hawaii, however for people coming to the site from other places, they 
    would probably not get the point/meaning.
  <LI>If there is a director of the center, put it on the 
    main page.
  <LI>Replace the abbreviation menu with more descriptive 
    titles. Since this will occupy more space, I suggest that you organize the 
    information in a hierarchy.
  <LI>Link to &quot;Research&quot; and &quot;Software 
    Tools and Services&quot;. A short description of the contents could<BR> be displayed, rather than displaying cryptic initials 
    in the main menu.
  <LI>Make more specific statement about related research 
    and what position you are in now, even better, draw a comparison with any 
    currently available commercial package (e.g.,MS scr_save?) if existing.
  <LI>In today's world, there are so many software 
    products, if you can emphasize the unique, cool feature, that will fish in 
    net surfers.
  <LI>More descriptions about the researches at the first 
    levels. For example: There is not an explanation of what AEN stands for.
  <LI>More on-line demo
  <LI>Everything should be visible on the first page 
    without scrolling
  <LI>The order of the sections on personal home page is 
    somewhat incorrect. How about </LI>

  <LI>Sitemap button should have an ALT tag of 
    &quot;Main/Sitemap&quot;.
  <LI>On the B/W Mac, one viewer complained for not being 
    able read the text on the Member profiles pages after the background loaded
  <LI>Make the links with more contrast in the site map.
  <LI>A bit clustered?
  <LI>Logo is nice but viewer expected to see the text 
    name of the group as a title on the home page, not in small text below the 
    button area
  <LI>&quot;the bold headings in the right frame 
    (&quot;Research&quot;, etc) might be links to the summary pages directly, 
    instead of making me mentally sort the detailed menu on the left&quot;
  <LI>&quot;I thought the text description on the summary 
    pages were about a sentence too brief - I wanted to know more, but not 
    *that* much more, not so much that I would really go through the 15 waits to 
    see the detailed pages. If I already knew what the tools did (i.e. jWiz) it 
    would be ok. Example: &quot;CSRS: a tool for collaborative software 
    review&quot; - is it stand-alone? Is it suitable for big or small 
    projects/groups? Does it require special infrastructure? I know I can go dig 
    it up, but if I am just dropping in on a search, I don't have time to dig on 
    everything.&quot;
  <LI>&quot;The words &lsquo;Open Source 
    arrangement&rsquo; should be a link to more detailed information about what 
    an open source arrangement is.&quot;
  <LI>The third paragraph on the right could have been 
    removed or integrated with the content table. This would put your address, 
    etc on the first page.
  <LI>To improve, however, the menu could have been 
    framed with an enabled frameborder, preferably at the bottom. The one here 
    takes up a bit too much space at the top, plus that the space between the 
    top and the menu itself is bit too wide.
  <LI>Making a frame, and making it enabled border to 
    facilitate web browser&rsquo;s search with more flexibility.
  <LI>&quot;I saw that the background is supposed to 
    change everyday, but the light blue seemed a bit sterile and dull. Maybe it 
    adds to readability for not being distracting, but I think that it's a bit 
    too boring. Other than that, it looked nice for the 5 minutes I spent 
    clicking around.&quot;
  <LI>Use the first photo as you have it and match the 
    blue background for a solid back since you don't need the extra space the 
    second photo takes up. Also, a GIF file at 72 dpi can look good and loads 
    quicker than a JPEG
  <LI>Jwiz: ... Please enter in the URL of your .java 
    file in the text field below, and press the Submit button to proceed.---&gt; 
    How about: Please enter the URL...
  <LI>... as well as empirical approaches to improving 
    ---&gt; How about: either improving or to improve.
  <LI>Make the navigation banner on top MUCH smaller, you 
    loose too much screen real-estate.
  <LI>Check to see if browser is IE4 and if not redirect 
    them to where they can download it. Add lots of ActiveX and DHTML stuff. 
    Also Microsoft Agents are nice. Add in a few LabCams, voice recognition, 
    collaboration support, and real-time DNA computing demo.
  <LI>Use fonts and color to make it attractive.
  <LI>GIF buttons are 34 colors, could be reduced to 16 
    saving 33 1/3 % bandwidth
  <LI>Nice if there were links to papers etc. on Philip 
    Johnson's page at least!
  <LI>Integrate the buttons to the site map
  <LI>The left bottom is empty. need put something there
  <LI>The color can be a little bit brighter.
  <LI>Overlap between research and tools are too large. I 
    was expecting research description under research, and maybe tools to 
    download on the tool button.
  <LI>More software screen shots and more downloadable or 
    web-based software
  <LI>Pointers to other (non-CSDL) related research, 
    papers, would be nice.
  <LI>At first blush the research topics and tools and 
    services look like so much alphabet soup. Something like a tool tip on 
    rollover (or status message) would help if it provided one-line definitions. 
    Even the pages for these sections don't always explain the acronyms.
  <LI>The Doug Peebles backgrounds are nice but the small 
    text is too hard to read in the dark areas. They should be bleached more 
    (de-saturate and push towards white)
  <LI>The extra &quot;selected section&quot; cursor with 
    the &quot;selected button&quot; mostly looks distracting (the 4 corner 
    fillets). I don't think average viewers will understand the metaphor. (also 
    it's not extensible in depth) Look for another way to locate the user in the 
    site hierarchy. I understand it because I've struggled with the same 
    problem. See http://www.kaiserhawaii.com for one way that I've dealt with 
    it. Note the use of tabs and outline expansion. Subsection localization is 
    tricky.
  <LI>I would like to also be able to click on the bold 
    keyword in the content overview to access that area, seeing that is where I 
    am<BR> reading about it, rather than having to find 
    somewhere else to go to this site. (A very picky point though! :-)
  <LI>One usability problem occurs if you use a link in 
    the FAQ part.There is no way back except you use the browsers back button 
    and<BR> no chance to change to the homepage if the page 
    was found using a search engine. You should back-link all pages at least 
    using the text links of the homepage. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The long list above are suggestions collected from 
viewers during the survey time. Many comments, if researched properly, will make 
major improvements to the current site. Some other suggestions are focused more 
on the cosmetic change of the site. Some are likely to be personal references. 
Yet, together they portrait what viewers expect to see and what are the most 
protruding points when browsing the site.&nbsp; Being able to understand web 
viewers' behaviors and expectation will help the web designers to bring the site 
closer and more pleasurable for viewers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

</TABLE>


<H3>Total Hour analysis</H3>
<P>Despite all the time taken in planning out the site, 
HTML coding took up the largest amount of time during the semester. This was 
partly due to the many changes which had to be made after new requests from Dr. 
Johnson were given, resulting in a time-consuming search through the site for 
the correct replacements. Although a macro was written to crawl through the site 
and do global replacements, this still took time to do.</P>
<P>Group Meetings took the second largest allotment of 
time. These meetings proved to be very helpful for us, as it helped us stay in 
synch with each other. It was at these group meetings that we learned who would 
do what, who didn't do their assignment, and what was still needed. These group 
meetings also proved to be encouraging to each other as the semester wore down.

<P> Writing was a 
major part of both the SRS and the web page itself, taking the third largest 
allotment of time during the semester. Writing was evenly split up among the 
SRS, this Tech Report, and the sections within the site itself. However, these 
96.6 hours do not reflect the many hours Dr. Johnson spent on the site, revising 
and writing sections that he had greatest knowledge of.</P>

<P> 
Organizational work, and Other work made up about 10% each of the total 
work done. Orgazational work included transcribing meetings, posting notes, and 
various other tasks needed to keep the group running smoothly. Considering the 
amount of work accomplished by the group, the 10% spent on organizational work 
seems small in comparison. Other work included tasks such as graphics, 
interviews, and items which did not fit in with any other category, yet did not 
deserve its own category.</P>
<P> 
Web Browsing 
and Research took about 9% of the total hours spent. Various things were 
researched during the design of this site. For instance, the search engine used 
was compared to others, and determined to be the best for CSDL's tasks. 
Information on how to create servlets also had to be researched, as no books 
covered this beta software in detail.</P>

<P>Class meetings took 46 hours out of the semester. These 
meetings were also helpful in determining if the Aziza group was on the right 
track according to Dr. Johnson's vision of the web site. However, despite taking 
up only 7% of the hours spent, class meetings proved to be the most time 
consuming in the sense that most of the new changes and implementations were 
assigned at this time.</P>

<P> The 
programming was split up into coding forms for the web search mechanism, and the 
java servlet for JWiz. As this was not the main focus of the group, a small time 
was dedicated to doing these tasks. Finally, time accounting took up 2% of the 
total time spent during the semester. This tracking of hours helped with seeing 
the productivity of the group, as well as who specialized in what as the 
semester went on.</P>

<A name=groupdynamics><H2>X. Group Dynamics</H2></A>
<P>As our group found out, there are several new things 
that you can run into when working as a group rather than as an individual.</P>

<H3>Developing Roles</H3>
<P>We found that as the project wore on, each of us fell 
into job roles. It may sound bad, but it was actually a good thing. For one, we 
could usually tell who would be doing what job, and that person knew what areas 
were their responsibility. As an example of how work may end up being grouped, 
this is how our group work was divided:</P>
<P>Anne Disney - Anne, aside from being in the Aziza group, 
was also a CSDL member. Because she was familiar with CSDL she was in charge of 
going through the CSDL documents not related with specific projects and grouping 
them for inclusion into the new site. She was also our liaison with management. 
Many times she was able to discuss things at greater length with Dr. Johnson 
then we were able to cover in class meetings. This aspect of group-manager 
interaction was very useful and our group was fortunate that Anne was able to 
fill this role.</P>
<P>Jarrett Lee - Jarrett became the graphics guy. He would 
do most of the site work related to graphics. Most of the members' photographs 
have been touched up and all of the buttons are courtesy of him. He was also 
responsible for setting up the servlett to run the community services. When it 
was time for a formal presentation of this project, he assumed the role of group 
spokesperson.</P>
<P>Tuan Huynh - Tuan was responsible for the web server and 
the search engine. He was in charge of everything in these areas - from 
installation and setup to maintenance and documentation.</P>
<P>Jennifer Saito - Jenn was the group leader. She was 
responsible for most of the organizational work. She posted most of the meeting 
notes, to do lists, and standards. She also headed the class meetings with Dr. 
Johnson.</P>

<H3>Decisions</H3>
<P>As you might guess, making a decision as an individual 
is much easier than making a decision as a group, you only have yourself to 
consult. When it comes to making a group decision, there are many new things 
that come into play. For one thing, you need to remember that you must consult 
the group - while you can try to make unilateral decisions, this method is not 
the best for morale. After that you must be tactful and be considerate of the 
other members. Compromise and a willingness to adhere to decisions is also key. 
You are going to need to work closely with the rest of the group and open 
hostilities among members has never speeded up any process.</P>
<P>All of the niceties, though, require time and patience. 
When time is running out on the project, spending that valuable resource in this 
manner can become frustrating. The benefits of having a group all going in the 
same direction, though, are worth the effort.</P>

<H3>Coordinating Communication</H3>
<P>The same difficulty that occurs when making decisions 
applies to Coordination. As an individual, you tell yourself, &quot;Okay, this 
is what I'm going to do&quot; and do it. As a group, you come to the decision 
and then need to make sure you all know about the decision and follow it. This 
is why posting things like meeting notes, to do lists, and standards are 
important. This is also why compromise is important - you will all have to live 
with and abide by the decisions that the group has made.</P>


<A name=areasforimp>
<H2>XI. Areas For Improvement</H2></A>
<P>As much as we would like to say that our research 
project went smoothly and there is nothing that we could have done differently, 
that is not the case. There were several areas in which there was room for 
improvement.</P>

<H3>File Locking</H3>
<P>If you ask anyone in the Aziza group they will probably 
tell you that the next time, there should be a file locking mechanism. The 
reason for this is that because there were so many people making modifications 
to the files: us, Dr. Johnson, the CSDL members, there was always the danger 
that one of us would overwrite someone else's hard work.</P>
<P>What would happen is that we would make a copy of the 
file and work on it off-site, then replace the now-outdated file with a new one. 
If two people were doing this at the same time, the first person's work would be 
overwritten by the second person who copied their file back into the site.</P>
<P>The best that we could do was to send out e-mail letting 
everyone else know when we would be making changes to which documents. Making 
back-ups of the entire site gave us some peace of mind, but it would have been a 
lot easier if there were an alternate method of preventing file errors.</P>


<A name=conclusions>
<H2>XII. Conclusions</H2></A>
<P>As we look back on the process of the project, some 
things became apparent to us. The most striking of these has been that the 
outlook of CSDL itself has somewhat changed due to the update of the site. With 
the addition of the services section, a question that members are now asking 
themselves is &quot;what can we make that is a service to the community?&quot; 
So in a way, the types of projects CSDL may pursue in the future has been 
affected.</P>

<P>Regarding the two different types of evaluation, we found that first-impression, e-mailed surveys were 
more critical than those done in-person. In fact, the in-depth interviews proved to be slightly less helpful than
those mass-mailed to people. Looking over the in-depth interviews, it seemed that either the group of people
selected were less demanding, or they were more reserved in their comments. A greater majority of the 
comments by in-depth interviewees was positive, compared with an even ratio of negative to positive 
comments by the first-impression interviewees. </P>

<P>This data could mean a number of things. One point to consider is that a member of the Aziza design 
group controlled the in-depth interviews. This may have inadvertently taken the interviewee along a positive 
tour of the site, causing their reaction to follow suit. Another item of consideration is that some people tend 
to be less negative to others in-person. This is either due to not wanting to offend, or being afraid to offend. 
People may have held their true feelings about the site within themselves, and this may have affected the 
in-depth interviews.</P>

<P>To contrast, those communicating through e-mail traversed through the site on their own, as in a real-life 
situation. There was no prepared route to take them through, instead, the user looked at sections that 
interested them, and which they would go to otherwise. Furthermore, these interviewees volunteered their 
time to look through the site and comment on it. Instead of merely accepting an interview, this group of people 
decided to spend some of their time to help out with this research, and so their comments may be more truthful.
If one is to decide to spend time on something, it most likely not going to be wasted by giving open praises. 
The interviewees were also able to think longer on their impressions to the site. Instead of being on the spot 
with another person, this group was able to spend as long as wanted to answer a question, or even refuse 
to answer a question at all. Finally, the in-person intimidation was not present during email. This may have 
relaxed the interviewee, allowing them to think more clearly, and giving more insightful information than those 
who were interviewed in-person.</P>

<P>This is just a single case study, but it has proven to be very interesting. It may be a possibility that 
controlled interviews do not reflect real-life browsing of web sites, and so should not be taken into 
consideration. However, they can be useful in finding out specific reactions about a web site, such as a 
certain page in a site. Some reactions to a site may not be remembered or noticed by a user, and so only 
an interviewer would be able to record this type of data.  Nonetheless, this case study has received more 
subjective comments from first-impression interviews. Due to a lack of a time constraint, less pressure, 
self-volunteering, and the ability to spend longer on the answers, these comments have been shown to 
find more about what the general public thinks on a web site. </P>

<P>It seems that the best method for obtaining data on a web site is to perform both in-depth interviews, and 
an informal first-impression interview. Both can obtain data that the other cannot, and correlation between 
the two can be stronger than opinions from one group. </P>

<A name=nextsteps>
<H2>XIII. Next Steps</H2></A>
<P>This is the list of things that needs to be done after 
the Spring 98 semester ended. These are the things that Aziza group could not 
achieve during the semester due to some difficulties beyond their reach or time

  <LI>Detail analysis of site evaluation result.<BR>
    Several points from the initial evaluations were made, but due to the ending of the semester, unable to be researched further.
    Hopefully future research may be made to confirm or disgard these new points. These include:
    <UL>
      <LI>Will rearranging the sections in the Member Pages prove to be better in attracting recruiters?</LI>
      <LI>Is there a better way to arrange items to reduce scrolling?</LI>
      <LI>Should the site map and the main page be split?</LI>
      <LI>Should the software packages be "advertised", including positive quotes from end-users?</LI>
      <LI>Should third-level graphics be completely removed, or added in?</LI>
      <LI>Are there any misleading items in the site that have been standardized as something else?</LI>
    </UL>
  <LI>A mechanism for users to enter their email 
    addresses, when downloading softwares from CSDL, for future update 
    notification. 
  <LI>Publicize the site. <UL>
      <LI>Move the new site from port 8080 to 80
      <LI>Back up and disable the old site
      <LI>Add an entry to the rc script to automatically 
        start the web server when server reboots. </LI>
    </UL> <BR>
    Due to members not having root access, the web site is unable to switch from port 8080 to 80. When a new system adminstrator
    for the ICS department is hired, the site will be transferred to the default port number, and the old site will be disabled.
  <LI>Get the JWiz servlet to work.<BR>
    Currently, the servlet is functional, but because of account restrictions, and having no one with root access, the classpath
    of the web server cannot be set to include JWiz. When the classpath is able to be set, the servlet will be available to the public.
  <LI>Make sure there is no more orphan pages in the site.
  <LI>Add 
    &quot;~csdl/private_html/Search/bin_allsite_search/htdig -v &amp;&quot;, a 
    script to update the search database, to a <STRONG>non-Aziza</STRONG> member's crontab. </LI> 
  <LI>Miscellaneous items
    <UL>
      <LI>Find a better icon for the "On-Line services available" programs</LI>
      <LI>Add "New" icons for newly updated items</LI>
      <LI>Possibly replace Danu's picture with one that matches the others</LI>
      <LI>Possibly find better phrasing for "on-line interface"</LI>
      <LI>Provide a less-technical explanation for less-technical users</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
