    Happy much-delayed Birthday! Sorry I was so lame that it took me this long
    to get you a card. I hope your birthday didn't suck, and that
    this card will cheer you, because you deserve to be in good cheer. I'm
    so happy that I have been with you for 8 of your birthdays, thought it
    seems like it hasn't been that many. I care about you very much, and I'm
    sorry that I occasionally don't express this very well (like when I
    give you your birthday card two months late!). If you think of any
    more birthday gifts you would like, let me know and I'll get them for
    Xmas! :) Wishing you another year of happiness and fulfillment, Love,
    your faithful companion,

    \heartpar{Just in case your were wondering, this card was created using
    LaTeX, a special shaped paragraph package, and a custom shape which I
    digitized by hand. The idea came to me while I was at UH thinking about
    what to put on my thesis dedication page. The UC LaTeX thesis style that I
    was using said ``For formatting the dedication page, you're on your own.
    After all, the dedication is a kind of poetry and there's no
    predicting the right way to format poetry.'' This got me to thinking
    about what I should put on my dedication page. So I was digging around
    in a LaTeX book and I found this shaped paragraph package. It comes with
    a heart shape which I thought would be cute, then I thought about making
    a custom shape. Then I was thinking about your card, and I thought it
    would be nifty to have a card in the shape of a cat. So I took the
    postcard in and scanned it at high resolution. Then I painstakingly
    assigned coordinates to the outline with a Mac datapoint program. Then
    I converted that into the format required by the package, and Viola!
    The cat! I hope you like it.}
