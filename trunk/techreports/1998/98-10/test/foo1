This system was designed to allow a user community to create a dynamic
WWW-based FAQ. Any user can browse through the web pages and make changes or
additions as necessary.  This provides an easy way to maintain an FAQ since any
member of the community can volunteer help. However, there is no access
control, so it relies on a cooperative user community. Since there is no
centralized authority in charge of the FAQ, pieces of potentially incorrect or
mutually conflicting information can be posted. In addition, new additions have
to written from scratch by contributors. Documentation on Faq-O-Matic is
provided through an FAQ maintained using Faq-O-Matic
\cite{faq-o-matic-website}.
