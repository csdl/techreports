\chapter{``jcvs'' Mailing List Subject Lines}
\label{cha:subject-appendix}
In this appendix I present some actual Subject lines extracted from a few days
of traffic on the jCVS mailing list. I provide this to demonstrate the chatty
an disorganized nature of most mailing lists.

\begin{alltt}

\chapter{Introductory Email to jCVS List}
\label{cha:intro-email}
The following email was sent to the jCVS list as an introduction to the
existence of the condensed jCVS list archive:

\begin{alltt}
{\footnotesize{}Date: Mon, 24 Jan 2000 17:18:34 -1000
From: Robert Brewer <rbrewer@@lava.net>
To: jcvs@@mail.gjt.org
Subject: Problem Solving jCVS archive
Message-ID: <3841508885.948734314@@sabrina.ics.Hawaii.Edu>
X-Mailer: Mulberry (Win32) [1.4.5, s/n U-300878]
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Content-Disposition: inline

Mahalo for that kind introduction Tim!

As Tim mentioned, I'm working on my Masters degree in ICS here at the
University of Hawaii at Manoa.

My research is in the area of improving the archives of product support
mailing lists like this one. My basic thesis is that when people go to an
archive of a product support mailing list, it is usually because they are
having some sort of problem with the product and they want to find a
solution. Therefore the archive should be designed to maximize the
efficiency with which users can find solutions to their problems.

I have created a system called MCS (Mailinglist Condensation System) which
takes existing mailing list archives and turns them into problem solving
archives. This is done through a process called condensation which takes
the verbose content of a mailing list and removes the messages which don't
have long-term relevance. The condensation is done by a human editor (for
the jCVS archive this was me) who leaves out all the messages which are
irrelevant to problem solving. The editor annotates the messages with
keywords, writes a one-line summary of each message, and even removes
extraneous text from the body of messages. The result is an archive which
is much smaller with a higher information density and four methods by which
searches can be performed: keyword search, symptom search, 2D search, and
full-text search.

I hope you'll take the time to try out the archive and maybe it will save
you some time by tracking down a problem you've been having with jCVS. In
about two weeks I will be putting up an online survey at the MCS archive to
gauge people's reaction to the system. Feel free to send comments about the
system using the Feedback page.

The MCS archive is located at <http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:8100/> and Tim
has graciously added it to the footer of each message to the list for easy
access. I'll be continuing to condense new messages and add them to the
archive.

Thanks for your time, and I hope the archive can become a valuable resource
for the list which lets us spend more time discussing new issues and less
time answering frequently asked questions. :)}

\chapter{Online User Questionnaire}
\label{cha:questionnaire-appendix}
I made the following questionnaire available to users of the system through a
web form. The questions were numbered, and each possible response is listed
with the numerical value which was used to denote that choice when recording
the data from the web form. Note that every multiple choice question contains
the option ``Not applicable''. This value was set as the default for every
question in the web form so that any bias towards default values would not skew
the results.

\section{MCS Two Minute Questionnaire}
Once you have used the this problem-solving archive, we would appreciate it if
you would take the time to fill out this brief questionnaire. It should only
take two minutes of your time. Mahalo!

\chapter{Raw Questionnaire Results}

choice questions, and Table \ref{tab:open-answer} shows the results of the
open-answer questions.

As a concept I would be VERY interested in a page giving stats (time devoted to editing, etc...) by those that condense, and some personal feedback from those people as far as how difficult they percieve their task. Keep me on what ever mailing list I recieved your notice and I will watch the development of your program.  Thank you.\\ \hline
      {\bf 3} & The webmacro mailing list (\url{www.webmacro.org}) & Maybe you could consider using tools that help you in summarizing and tagging text. There are a lot of scientific projects out there, but I'm not sure if it would be easy to get them on an open source basis. \\ \hline
      {\bf 4} & GNUJSP, GJT-DEV & I think the effort is tremendous, and the tool a great improvement over what was available. I would be very excited to see further development and support.\\ \hline
      {\bf 5} & PHP Mailing List -$>$ \url{www.php.net} & Neat concept - could be very useful for larger lists like the php or perl or mysql list.  A significant part of the message volume is from people asking common questions.  People are usually asking the question because they don't know what keywords to use to search the archives for the solution to their problem. (i.e. If you know how to grok widgets, then you probably know that you need to use the foo() function to do this.  However, if you don't know how to grok widgets, then you would have to use 'grok and widget' as your keys for searching the archives.  Chances are that whoever asked the question last phrased their question in a different fashion - so the previous exchange on the list regarding this topic is very little help to the new user. ) ..uh.. why I am bothering to write this - you obviously know this already - that is why you built the system... :P  One note - I found that the interface was pretty clunky.  Good Luck!  PS Remember that the best defense is a good offence - try using foul language in your thesis defense ;)\\ \hline
