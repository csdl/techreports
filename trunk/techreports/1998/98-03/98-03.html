<h4>Abstract</h4> 

This document describes the design of CSDL2: a social, physical, and
virtual environment to support the development of world class software
engineering professionals.  In CSDL2, a "multi-generational learning 
community" of faculty, graduate students, and
undergraduates all collaborate within a structured work environment for
practicing <em>product</em>, <em>process</em>, and <em>organizational</em>
engineering. A primary outcome of these activities is demonstrable
improvement by each member in each of three primary skill sets:

<ul>
<li> Development of innovative <b>software</b> and its associated <b>work
products</b> (including software requirements specifications, project
plans, designs, prototypes, code, released versions, and 
regression tests.)

<li> Development of written analysis <b>reports</b> (from
small scale technical reports to comprehensive theses).

<li> Development of oral/visual <b>presentations</b> (including 30 and
60 minute talks, recorded videos, software demos, and poster design and 
presentation)

</ul>
<p>

Regular qualitative and quantitative measurement of both individuals and
the organization itself is built into the CSDL2 environment. Individual
measurement is not used to rank members or evaluate them, but rather as an
essential mechanism for reflection by each person on their activities
within the group and their progress over time.  Organizational measurement
is used to determine if the CSDL2 environment is successfully pursuing its
five year mission: to become influential as a model environment for the
development of software engineers, and to produce graduates who pursue
successful careers within academia and industry.

<p>

This document is intended to be read by ICS faculty, University
of Hawaii administrators, current CSDL members, and others interested
in the design of a center for software development leadership through
learning. 


<h2>Background: From CSDL1 to CSDL2</h2>

For six years, I have supervised a research group called the Collaborative
Software Development Laboratory (CSDL---henceforth referred to as CSDL1)
within the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the
University of Hawaii. By traditional measures, CSDL1 has been a succcessful
and productive research group. In six years its members have published six
journal articles, seven major conference publications, one book chapter,
nine workshop publications, two Ph.D. theses, two M.S. theses, and over
thirty technical reports. CSDL1 has been supported by grants from the
National Science Foundation, Tektronix Inc., the Pacific International
Center for High Technology Research, and Digital Equipment
Corporation. CSDL1 has produced a suite of collaborative systems and
associated technology that has been downloaded by over 300 sites
world-wide, and that comprises over 60,000 lines of fully documented C++
and Lisp programs.

<p>

More recently, all CSDL1 members have undergone
intensive study of the Personal Software Process, and have adopted a
customized version of this process for all current CSDL1 development
projects, as well as defining a "Personal Thesis Process" to aid in the
development of B.S., M.S., or Ph.D. dissertations.  A more detailed look at
the history of CSDL from a software engineering perspective is provided in
the following technical report, which provides important background
material for this proposal:

</blockquote>
<p>

Over these six years, the mission of CSDL1 has evolved substantially.  In
its early years, CSDL1 did not have an explicit mission statement, but I
managed it according to the following implicit mission: "publish high
quality research and produce high quality researchers".  Unfortunately,
this "pure research" focus became increasingly out of sync with the needs
of my students, my local software development community, and my
profession. Furthermore, it produced the canonical academic dissonance in
my daily activities, since I viewed my time as being divided between
"research" and "teaching".  I attempted to bridge the gap for my students
by explaining why I believed the skills required to become a good
researcher were highly valuable even if they decided to choose a
non-research industry career path:

</A>
</blockquote>

<p>

For the last several years, I have focused more strongly upon the group as
a whole and a new, explicit mission to become a "world class" software
engineering research <em>and development</em> group.  We began to pursue
and learn about quality of software in all of its manifestations:
requirements documents, designs, code, tests, and maintenance activities.
We focused on quality even when it did not immediately appear to lead to a
research publication, and in fact this focus probably slowed down the time
to publication of some of our research (although, of course, the results
were of higher quality).

<p>

During this period, CSDL1 developed a concrete sense for what I call high
quality <em>product engineering</em>: the skills necessary to produce
useful requirements, design, code, and test work products.  We also began
to understand high quality <em>process engineering</em>: the design and
evolution of the procedures and activities necessary to produce high
quality work products, and to improve the efficiency with which groups
produce these documents over time.  (The 
<a href="http://www.dstc.edu.au/TU/staff/johnson/csdl-se.html">
         Annotated Overview of CSDL Software Engineering</a> 
provides examples of these activities.)

<p>

This "transitional" period in the mission of CSDL1 was quite productive,
and it was much easier to demonstrate to my students the alignment between
working in this research group and their future careers. Clearly, the
ability to produce high quality software work products would be valuable to
them regardless of the "research" aspect.  

<p>

The mission and structure of CSDL2 arises from the following epiphany: <em>
a group which is organized and managed with the mission of producing "world
class" software engineers will inevitably and implicitly produce high
quality software research.</em> In a sense, CSDL2 inverts the original
mission of CSDL1 and its rationale: rather than pursuing research for its
own sake and rationalizing its applicability to the profession, CSDL2 will
pursue the growth of world-class software engineering professionals
with the knowledge that innovative software development and its publication
is an intrinsic component of world-class status.

Thus conceived, CSDL2 has several useful attributes:

<ol>

<p><li> <em>No research vs. education.</em>
CSDL2 eliminates the classical dichotomy of research "versus"
education.  CSDL2 is an explicitly educational environment focused on
providing its members with the product, process, and organizational
engineering skills required to become world class software engineers.

<p><li> <em>High professional visibility.</em> Despite its explicit
educational mission, CSDL2 will nonetheless maintain high levels of
"research productivity", as conventionally measured.  This is because
"world class" is not a self-bestowed title; it must come from the community
at large in recognition of an ability to consistently perform innovative
software engineering <em>and</em> make this visible to the community. In
CSDL2, reports and presentations are two of the three fundamental skill
areas, and success in acquiring these skills leads to visibility in the
community. Unlike CSDL1, research results are a natural byproduct of the
pursuit of world-class software engineering skills, not the converse.

<p><li> <em>Product, process, and organizational engineering.</em> A mission centering upon
the development of each individual's talent as a software engineer (rather
than upon production of published papers) both broadens and integrates
together the group environment as a whole with the skills to be acquired by
CSDL2 participants. While CSDL1 developed a solid grounding in product and
process engineering concepts, CSDL2 will augment product and process with a
new focus: organizational engineering.  I use the term
"organizational engineering" to refer to the social and physical aspects of
the software engineer's environment.  With the move to POST and the
acquisition of suitable lab space, CSDL2 can explore organizational
engineering, a focus that was structurally impossible for CSDL1.

<p><li> <em>A showcase environment.</em> The mission of CSDL2 naturally
aligns with the ongoing need of the ICS department, the College of Natural
Sciences, and the University as a whole to provide "showcase" environments
that demonstrate our ability to provide relevant, state-of-the-art
education and research.  Just as ICS 101 provides a showcase environment
for introductory computer skills education, CSDL2 will provide a showcase
environment for advanced undergraduate and graduate software development
education.  Visitors to the CSDL2 laboratory will discover a physical
environment that provides both common and private working areas, high
quality computational facilities, walls adorned with well-designed posters
that present results of prior projects and the designs and status of
on-going projects, and lab members who, as a natural outcome of their
work efforts, are ready with Powerpoint slide presentations, demos,
software prototypes, short videos clips, technical reports, web pages, or
other mechanisms to provide visitors with an overview of their progress in
CSDL2.

<p><li> <em>Distance education with a twist.</em>
CSDL1 has a tradition of retaining the involvement of past members:
prior graduates often remain active participants on our internal mailing
list, review papers and software designs, and attend the quarterly "CSDL
lunch".  Thus, CSDL1 has an established combination of both physical and
virtual participation.  CSDL2 will build upon these structures to
incorporate distance education into its paradigm.  After an initial period
of on-site "residency", members can elect to continue active participation
in CSDL2 using a variety of electronic media to maintain dialogue, virtual
presence in CSDL2 activities, and continued progress toward world-class
status.
<p>

CSDL2 differs from conventional distance education approaches in one
critical way. A primary focus of CSDL2 is to educate members in
organizational engineering: the social and physical aspects of software
development.  Thus, a portion of CSDL2 education <em>must</em> occur
on-site, in the physical CSDL2 laboratory, so that members can experience
these social and physical mechanisms first-hand. Furthermore, effective
acquisition of the advanced product and process engineering skills
practiced in CSDL2 require the higher "bandwidth" provided by physical
co-location with fellow students and faculty.  Following the initial
"residency" period, in which a shared sense of product, process, and
organizational concepts are acquired, I expect that distance education can
be utilized quite successfully by CSDL2 to support their members' ongoing
pursuit of world class capabilities.

<p>

I believe that our distance education philosophy is pedagogically
well-founded and politically important: if institutions such as 
UH-Manoa are to survive, they must demonstrate the value of on-site
learning.  CSDL2 will provide an example of the benefits
of physical presence at UH-Manoa
and how they can continue to maintain contact and involvement after
they leave. 

<p><li> <em>Patterns.</em> 
The product, process, and organizational engineering mechanisms
adopted by CSDL2 will be documented via a collection of patterns
and pattern languages.  The development and maintenance of CSDL2
patterns will support improvement to our engineering practices and provide
a means to represent the "culture" of CSDL2.  Furthermore, these patterns
will provide an appropriate abstraction of CSDL2 "best practices" that can
be used by other departments and organizations within the University who
wish to leverage off our experiences. For example, CSDL2 
patterns and other materials could
be used to facilitate the design of a "Center for Biological Leadership
through Learning."

</ol>

In summary, CSDL2 continues the natural trajectory of the CSDL1 mission
over the past six years, and exploits the move to POST and
acquisition of lab space. These factors make development of world-class
software engineers within a matrix of product, process, and organizational
engineering possible.  The next section briefly overviews the research that
guides the design of CSDL2. The following section provides an initial
design of organizational and physical structures in CSDL2.  The final
section presents some of the current and future issues in deploying CSDL2.

<h2>Related Work</h2>

The design of CSDL2 is guided by the intersection of 
many intellectual threads, including: the
sociology of software development; the patterns work of Christopher
Alexander and its application to software design and software organizations;
educational paradigms from art and architecture; the personal software
process of Watts Humphrey; and reflective learning practices as 
articulated by Donald Schon.

<p>


<h4>Sociological aspects of software engineering</h4>

Research and experience with successful and unsuccessful software
projects has highlighted the importance of the impact of social
and physical issues on the outcomes of software projects. 
Many software engineering treatises, including "Peopleware"
(DeMarco and Lister), "The Mythical Man-Month" (Brooks), and "Managing the
Software Process" (Humphrey), note that social and physical aspects of the
software engineering workplace can be far more important in determining the
productivity and quality of software engineers than methods or tools. 
<p>

DeMarco and Lister state that "sociology is more important than technology
or even money" in the success of software development. In fact, they
performed a "coding wars" experiment over 10 years that shows wide
variations in productivity (10:1) between participants, but that these
productivity variations correlated better with the physical environment and
corporate culture than with programming language, years of experience,
numbers of defects, or salary. Their experiences indicate that the social
and physical aspects of a world class software development group should
include many of the following factors:

<ul>
<p><li> Adequate private, quiet space for each developer with ample
     desk and table space.

<p><li> Easily accessable common areas for spontaneous small group discussions
     without disturbing privately working developers.

<p><li> An environment that supports the "flow" state and allows developers to
     minimize interruptions when desired.

<p><li> Reflection and analysis of the successes and failures of prior
     projects which enables continuous improvement in organizational,
     process, and product engineering.

<p><li> Scheduling that allows members to "have a life" outside of
     work. DeMarco and Lister wryly note that "they will anyhow."

<p><li> An ability by developers to configure and re-configure their 
     physical environment to track their changes in needs for personal vs.
     common space, and changes in the people they are working most
     closely with. In other words, the ability of evolve the physical space
     in response to changes in the organizational space.
</ul>

<p>

The design of the physical and social environment for CSDL2 is intended to
satisfy each of these recommendations. Furthermore, organizational
measurements of CSDL2 can be used to assess compliance with many of these
factors explicitly. For example, a bi-annual CSDL2 evaluation filled out by
each member might include the following question:
<pre>
How often do you feel disturbed by members working near your private space?
Never     Rarely     Occasionally     Frequently     Constantly
</pre>


<h4>Patterns in Software and Software Organizations</h4>

Over the past several years, the study of architecture in general, and the
work of architect Christopher Alexander in particular, has become extremely
influential within the software engineering community. Alexander says that
the job of an architect is to give expression to the <em>patterns</em> in
the use of space that permit the building's occupants to carry out their
daily actions effectively.  He claims that surprisingly few patterns are
needed to describe and generate buildings, and that the immense variety of
buildings arises from the infinite number of ways that these basic patterns
can be combined.  He further claims that when everyone involved knows the
pattern language of the building, it is easy for the builders to construct
an edifice that is harmonious with the lives and work of the building's
users.  The patterns constitute a kind of <em>design language</em> for
communication between builder and inhabitant.

<p>

Alexander's concept of patterns has been applied to software design in a
landmark book entitled "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object
Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John
Vlissides. This book, and others that have appeared since, catalogue
commonly occcuring patterns according to a structured template that
includes the pattern's intent, its motivation, applicability, structure,
participants, collaborations, consequences, implementation, sample code,
known usage, and related patterns.  An example design pattern is
called "Chain of Command", whose intent is to "avoid coupling the 
sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a
chance to handle the request.  Chain the receiving objects and pass the
request along the chain until an object handles it."

<p>

James Coplien applied the pattern language approach to organizational
aspects of the software development process. His work catalogues over
thirty patterns he discovered in the work practices at AT&T Bell Labs
over a period of several years. Such patterns include "Organization
follows location", which concerns the appropriate allocation of 
tasks and roles across a geographically distributed work force, and 
"Application design is bounded by test design", which concerns the
timing of test plan design.  

<p>

In CSDL2, our successes in product, process, and organizational engineering
will be codified within a set of patterns, which I intend to refine over
time into a pattern language for the design of high performance learning
environments for software engineering and other disciplines.  Just as
Alexander's architectural pattern languages supports construction of
successful buildings in a variety of contexts, our pattern language is
intended to enable others to leverage off our experiences in CSDL2, and
design high quality learning environments in other contexts.  Furthermore,
I conjecture that every world class software engineering environment is
itself a world class learning environment, and so our pattern language
will apply to both professional and academic organizational designs.

<h4>From classrooms to multi-generational learning communities</h4>

I believe that neither traditional classroom environments nor traditional
research group environments are well suited to the pursuit of world class
software engineering capabilities. Traditional classrooms do not create a
physical space in which people work together, but rather an ephemeral
environment in which one person typically "delivers" education to several
others. The typical research group environment, of which CSDL1 was an
example, also appears to fall short. Although a research group lab space
does provide a persistant environment in which people can work together,
the canonical research mission is not congruent with the skills
required by world-class software professionals.
<p>

A third paradigm for a learning environment is the architecture school
studio.  In "Architecture: The Story of Practice", by Dana Cuff, the studio
is described in the following fashion: "Almost seventy percent of an
architectural curriculum takes place in or is related to the studio.  This
part of the student's education is really a series of design seminars
meeting for sixteen to twenty hours a week with one faculty member.  It has
been axiomatic that architectural knowledge is transmitted most effectively
on a one-to-one basis--a teacher sitting with a single student for fifteen
minutes to one hour engaged in an often silent dialogue of pencil lines and
fragmentary sketches.  This is then reinforced by small group reviews where
peer criticism becomes an important ingredient."

<p>

CSDL2 reflects the architectural studio paradigm in the following way: that
intensive one-on-one interaction <em>in the context of actual software
development activity</em> is essential to transmission of software
engineering knowledge.  In other words, software engineering skills must be
transferred by engaging the teacher in the activity of software engineering
itself.  This is radically different from classrooms, in which teachers
typically present "canned" or pre-solved problems, or even research groups,
in which the stratification of concerns means that the principal
investigators rarely concern themselves with coding and the student members
rarely concern themselves with grant writing or review.

<p>

The application of the architectural design studio model to software
education is not new; an experimental "software design studio" course has
been taught at MIT, for example.  The design of CSDL2 is not a simple
transliteration of architecture to software, however.  In CSDL2,
everyone---faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates---engage in the
<em>same</em> structured approach to deepened understanding of product,
process, and organizational engineering by practice and improvement in the
skills of software development, analysis reports, and presentations.
Faculty might pursue these tasks with greater efficiency and produce at a
higher level of quality, but every participant, including faculty, are
intent upon improving the same skill set.  CSDL2 activities are organized
to enable novices to learn by watching both senior students and the faculty
engaged in the same practice they are attempting to acquire. I call this a
<em>multi-generational learning community</em>. In this way, CSDL2 begins
to reflect the performance arts, where, for example, student musicians
learn to practice and perform in part by observing their mentors engage in
their own practice and performance.

<h4>Personal Software Process and Reflective Learning</h4>

The goal of engaging all CSDL2 participants at whatever level of skill in
the same structured work activities is a nice vision, but leaves unresolved
a critical and delicate issue: what set of structuring mechanisms for
software engineering "scales" from novice to expert, allows improvement in
skill level regardless of level, and facilitates transmission of knowledge
and insights between and across levels?  Fortuitously, there is an
excellent candidate: the Personal Software Process of Watts Humphrey, which
we have been studying and applying to our work activities in CSDL1 for the
past year.

<p>

The Personal Software Process (PSP) provides a strategy for implementing
software process improvement at the individual level. This is in marked
contrast to other methods, such as the Capability Maturity Model or
ISO9000, which focus on process improvement at the level of organizations,
and which appear to require relatively large organizational infrastructure.
PSP, as described in "A Discipline for Software Engineering" by 
Watts Humphrey, provides a comprehensive approach to deploying 
the following empirically-guided model of software process 
improvement to most of the software engineering work products:

<ol>
<li> Collect data on the process and products of development. 

<li> Analyze this data in such a way that proposals for potential process
improvements result.

<li> Implement one or more of these proposals as changes to the current
process.

<li> Evaluate the changes over time by continued data collection. If the
changes are indeed improvements, this should be reflected in the process
and/or product data.

</ol>

Over the past year in CSDL1, we practiced Humphrey's techniques for
software engineering unchanged, and adapted them to dissertation
development by designing a "Personal Thesis Process".  Finally, based upon
analysis of breakdowns in our use of PSP for software development, we have
begun to customize it for greater effectiveness within our group.


<p>
<blockquote> 
The CSDL1 Personal Thesis Process:
<br>
<A HREF="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/PTP/">

</A>
</blockquote>
<p>

In CSDL2, we will apply the "PSP paradigm" not only to its original domain
(software development) and to the thesis process, but to all activities in
the three fundamental skill sets.  In this way, PSP becomes our approach to
"reflective practice", as discussed by Donald Schon in "Educating the
Reflective Practitioner: Toward a New Design for Teaching and Learning in
the Professions".  Schon distinguishes three forms of reflection, each of
which will be emphasized in CSDL2 as vital approaches to learning:
<ul>
<li> <em>Reflection in action</em>.  This is the act of thinking about what
     we are doing while we are doing it. For example, talented jazz musicians
     may reflect upon what they are playing and what the other musicians are
     playing while in the act of improvisation.  In software, this might occur
     as a reflection upon good design practice while designing a system.
<li> <em>Reflection on action</em>.  This occurs when you interrupt the action
     to reflect upon it. Classical PSP activities, such as stopping to record
     a Process Improvement Proposal, fall into this category.
<li> <em>Reflection on practice</em>.  This is the act of surfacing and 
     criticizing tacit understandings or assumptions that have grown up 
     through repeated practice.  For example, the designer might become aware
     that they have fallen into the habit of "always assuming a client-server
     solution". 
</ul>


<h2>The Design of CSDL2</h2>

As discussed above, CSDL2 is a natural evolution onward from the CSDL1
research group, and is intended to apply concepts from social aspects of
software engineering, pattern languages, art and architecture educational
paradigms, and software process improvement. The goal is a high
performance, multi-generational learning environment for the development of
world class software engineering professionals. This section presents an
initial design to be used to bootstrap the CSDL2 organization.  I expect
many of the following design features to be refined and improved as we put
these ideas in practice.

<h4>Physical Environment</h4>

CSDL2 will be situated in Suite 307 of the POST Building at the University 
of Hawaii, plus an additional single office in POST 303F.  The suite 
and office have the following basic layout:

</pre>

<p>
CSDL2 will be initially furnished with the following equipment:
<table width=100%>
<tr><td><li> 3 SparcStations (Unix/Solaris)
    <td><li> 1 Macintosh 
<tr><td><li> 6 AlphaStations (Windows/NT)
    <td><li> 1 Color Printer
<tr><td><li> 1 Large Screen TV
    <td><li> 1 VCR
<tr><td><li> 1 Frame-syncing VHS video camera
    <td><li> 9 workstation cameras
<tr><td><li> 1 scanner
    <td><li> Frame grabber/video interface
</table>

<p>
<p>

Initially, seven people will be housed in the suite. The office (303F)
will be furnished with a single workstation and table.  It will be utilized
as a meeting and private "deep thought" area.

<p>
The SparcStations and Macintosh are currently owned by CSDL1. 
The AlphaStations and Color Printer have been awarded to CSDL1
as an equipment grant and should arrive shortly.  The remaining
equipment will be purchased from current CSDL1 grants.

<p>

Each member of CSDL2 will be provided with their own workstation, desk,
table, chair, filing cabinet, bookshelf, and whiteboard.  These
furnishings, as well as a set of <em>movable</em> partitions, will be
selected to allow CSDL2 members to easily evolve and configure the 
physical environment of the suite to better support their work
activities. 

<p>

The physical space will be organized in an attempt to create
several patterns of a world class software development group:
<ul>
<li> Facilitation of highly productive work habits (i.e. the "flow state") via
     adequate personal desk, table, and workstation facilities.
<li> Facilitation of collaboration (both students and faculty members are 
     physically co-located).
<li> Availability of texts and journals. (By co-locating students with faculty, 
     reference books and journals can be centrally located in a common space, 
     facilitating access. The lack of a central book repository 
     is a significant problem in CSDL1.) 

<li> Physical manifestations of individual and group activities, progress, and accomplishments.  
     (posters, portfolios, a "wall of honor" containing bound copies of all
     completed CSDL theses, etc.)

</ul>

<h4>The CSDL2 Portfolio</h4>

In a traditional computer science research group, the fundamental "output"
of the group is a research publication.  In CSDL2, the fundamental
"output" is a much richer representation of progress called 
the <em>CSDL2 Portfolio</em>.  

<p>

All members of CSDL2--faculty, graduate students, and
undergraduates---engage in the creation of an individual portfolio. A major
revision and presentation of all of the portfolios occurs once per year,
although each member can update it incrementally throughout the year.  The
portfolio is a combination of physical and virtual artifacts. A complete
portfolio includes all of the following:

<ol>
<li> A CSDL2 home page for that person

<li> Examples of the member's best software work products to date:
<ul>
<li> Designs
<li> Code
<li> Documentation
<li> Tests
<li> Requirements
<li> Prototypes
<li> Publically released software
</ul>

<li> Representations of the member's CSDL2 process, including:
<ul>
<li> PSP time and defect data
<li> Personal checklists
<li> Project PERT/GANTT charts for prior/upcoming year.
<li> Thesis PERT/GANTT charts for prior/upcoming year.
</ul> 

<li> Information on the member's current project(s) via:
<ul>
<li> Executable demo
<li> Project poster
<li> Powerpoint presentation
<li> Technical reports and published papers
<li> Video clips
</ul>


<li> Examples of the member's previous: 
<ul>
<li> Executable demos
<li> Project posters
<li> Powerpoint presentations
<li> Technical reports and published papers
<li> Video clips
</ul>

</ol>

CSDL2 portfolio development, its presentation, and its periodic updating
serve a critical educational purpose.  First, it provides a concrete
representation for display, review and evaluation of the each member's
three fundamental skill sets: software work products, written reports, and
oral/visual presentations.  
<p>

Second, and more importantly, the CSDL2 portfolio provides a concrete
representation of <em>improvement</em> in the skill sets by each member. By
including both current and prior examples of CSDL2 artifacts, as well as
PSP process data, each member can show how their skills have improved over
the past year.  The ability to show improvement is valued more in CSDL2
portfolios than simple output, and is substantially different from 
typical representations of the quality of the research group, CSDL1
included. Note that the introduction to this document described CSDL1
in terms of the numbers of publications and grants.  A goal of 
the design of CSDL2 is to provide an alternative, richer means of
characterizing the output of the research group in which a broader 
variety of work products can be referred to, and in which the productivity of 
the group can be expressed in terms of the improvements made by individual
members. 


<h4>Projects</h4>

Though the CSDL2 Portfolio is the primary visible outcome of group
activities, it does not constrain the actual development domains and
recurrent activities for the group.  While these will certainly evolve over
time, CSDL2 will begin by continuing along the research and development
trajectory of CSDL1, for which we have well-established competancy, 
support, and visibility.  The projects we will initially pursue are
the following:

<ol>
<p><li> <em>Kona: Industrial Trials of Review Technology</em>.  <br>
     This project concerns the development of Java-based review 
     technology to support the process of Formal Technical Review. 
     It augments our experiences in the development of CSRS, a 
     Unix/XEmacs-based review system with new insights into 
     empirical process improvement and measurement dysfunction. 
     <p>
     <blockquote>

     </A>
     </blockquote>
<p>

<p><li> <em>PSP/Baseline: Empirically driven tool support for PSP</em>.  <br>
     This project has two parts: a first part 
     which concerns an empirical study of breakdowns occurring
     in the traditional (manual) PSP process, which serves to generate
     requirements for tool support for PSP. The second part is the 
     implementation and evaluation of this tool support.  We 
     have collected data (over 1500 discrete breakdowns) from analysis
     of data collected from a class on PSP in Spring 1997, but have not
     yet completed the data analysis and requirements generation. Some
     flavor of where this might lead can be seen in the following white
     paper from a related project:
     <p>
     <blockquote>

     </A>
     </blockquote>


<p><li> <em>BRIE: A Benchmark Inspection Experiment</em>.  <br>
     This project concerns the development of a replicable experiment 
     for teaching and learning about software review.  
     <p>
     <blockquote> 
     A white paper on BRIE
     <br>
     <A HREF="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/brie/">
     http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/brie/
     </A>
     </blockquote>


<p><li> <em>CSDL2: product, process, and organizational patterns for a 
        high performance software learning environment</em>.  <br>
     Clearly, CSDL2 itself will be an object of intensive study for our group. 
     We will reflect upon our experiences, both positive and negative, and 
     over time build a set of patterns that organize and abstract our 
     insights into effective learning. 

</ol>




<h4>Advisory Board and Industrial Sponsorship</h4>

An important mechanism in our pursuit of world-class status as a software
development learning organization is interaction with world-class
researchers and practitioners. This interaction will be facilitated by the
establishment of the CSDL2 Advisory Board.  I anticipate about six Advisory
Board members at any one time, each serving for 2-3 years.  Board members
will provide feedback upon CSDL2 activities and portfolios.  Given
sufficient funding, I hope to sponsor one visit to CSDL2 by each Board
Member during their term of service for a 2-3 days of interaction.  Initial
candidates for the CSDL2 advisory board include the following:

<table width=100%>

<h4>CSDL2 Initial Membership</h4>

For Fall, 1997, CSDL2 will begin with the following members:
<p>
<table width=100%>
<tr><td><b>Name</b><td><b>Role/Program</b><td><b>Sponsorship</b>
<tr><td>Philip Johnson<td>Faculty<td>UH
<tr><td>Jay Corbett<td>Faculty<td>UH
<tr><td>David Brauer
    <td>Industrial Fellow
    <td>WorldPoint, Inc.
<tr><td>Russ Tokuyama<td>CIS Ph.D.<td>UH
<tr><td>Cam Moore
    <td>CIS Ph.D.
    <td>Tektronix
<tr><td>Jennifer Geis
    <td>ICS M.S.
    <td>NSF
<tr><td>Anne Disney
    <td>ICS M.S.
    <td>Independent
<tr><td>Ronalene Alboro
    <td>ICS B.S.
    <td>UH
</table>
<p>

I anticipate that this number of members is quite close to or perhaps even
exceeds the maximum initial "carrying capacity" of the CSDL2 physical
environment.  Initially, only one faculty member (Philip
Johnson) will move to physical residency within the CSDL2 suite; Jay
Corbett will continue to be based from his external ICS faculty office.

<p>

For the first year, CSDL2 membership will be kept at this relatively low
level, both due to physical space constraints and the need to enable high
levels of quality interaction between faculty and students. It may be that
the members in physical residency at CSDL2 never grows beyond a half dozen
or so.  However, I expect the total number of CSDL2 members to grow as
members move from physical to "virtual" residency.  For example, current or
future Ph.D. program members may choose to spend one to two years in
physical residency at CSDL2, followed by physical residency at their
industrial research site and virtual residency within CSDL2.  Virtual CSDL2
residents continue to engage in activities oriented toward improvement of
their software engineering skills and portfolios, and use a variety of
internet-based technologies for synchronous and asynchronous collaboration
to facilitate interaction with their other CSDL2 colleagues.  

<h4>CSDL2 Activities and Events</h4>

CSDL2 activities are designed to provide regular opportunities for:
<em>practice</em> of the three skill sets, <em>feedback</em> via review,
and <em>reflection</em> upon the feedback and practice via measurement and
analysis. CSDL2 activities are organized around weekly, monthly, 
semesterly, and yearly activities:
<p>
Weekly activities:
<ul>
<p><li> <em>Project work.</em> All members volunteer to work on one or
more of the ongoing CSDL2 projects. Each of these projects generates
requirements across all of the three skill sets: software work products,
written analysis reports, and oral/visual presentations. The focus on 
each of these three areas will shift from week to week, of course. 

<p><li> <em>Weekly Advisor Review.</em> Each student member will meet for
approximately an hour each week with their faculty advisor to review 
their progress and obtain feedback.

<p><li> <em>Weekly CSDL2 Lunch Presentation.</em> CSDL2 will institutionalize
a tradition within CSDL1 of group lunches. Unlike CSDL1, the physical
environment of CSDL2 will enable us to utilize these lunches more
effectively. On a rotating basis, each member of CSDL2 will present
a 15-30 minute talk at the weekly lunch.  The topics will vary from
status reports on their projects, to interesting papers, to speculative
proposal presentations. As with all CSDL2 group
presentations, it will be videotaped in order to allow review by the 
presenter of their own performance, and to allow absent members to see
the presentation. The video can also be sent to virtual members, and can
serve as "raw footage" for incorporation into multi-media presentations. 
</ul>

<p>
Monthly activities:

<ul>
<p><li><em>Group Process Review.</em> Once a month, each member will
provide a report generated from their PSP data collection activities. This
data will be aggregated and used to generate a presentation on the group's
overall process characteristics for the preceding month.  This data is then
used to propose new (or modify existing) project, process, and
organizational patterns.  
<p>
This presentation also presents an opportunity for reflection by the group
on process improvement opportunities for the upcoming month. It is
videotaped for later feedback and analysis.
</ul>

<p>
Semesterly activities:
<ul>
<p><li><em>Portfolio Day.</em> At the beginning of each semester (i.e. in
January and September), CSDL2 presents a public, day-long session of demos and
presentations of each member's current portfolio. Each member is responsible for
presenting examples of each of the three skills: a demo of software, a
written report, and a presentation.  In addition to their personal
portfolios, faculty directors are also responsible for preparing a
presentation
on the state of the CSDL2 pattern language. 
<p>
Portfolio day is scheduled for the
beginning of each semester, rather than at the end, so that members are not
overloaded with Portfolio Day responsibilities on top of other end-of-semester
school responsibilities.
<p>

CSDL2 Portfolio Day will be publically announced, and attendance of prospective
CSDL2 members, other students, and members of the local software
development community will be sought. I hope to schedule Portfolio Days to
coincide with visits by members of the Advisory Board, as this is an
excellent opportunity to obtain useful feedback from them on the group.
The CSDL2 Portfolio Day continues in the tradition of the CSDL1 Research
Symposiums, which have been held four times since 1992.


</ul>

<p>
Yearly activities:
<ul>
<p><li><em>Thesis Celebration.</em> Graduating members of CSDL2 will 
present their thesis projects at a public symposium, along with other
components of their portfolio.  This could be held as part of a 
Portfolio Day or separately, if graduation occurs in May.

<p><li><em>CSDL2 Retreat.</em> Once a year, in late August, all members of
CSDL2 will go on a full-day retreat.  In preparation for this retreat, the
monthly group process reviews will be aggregated into a presentation on the
entire prior year.  The CSDL2 project, process, and organizational patterns
are revised and updated. Finally, all members fill out the yearly 
CSDL2 evaluation questionnaire, which generates data on how CSDL2 has
been perceived to be succeeding or failing in its mission to support
the development of world-class software professionals.
<p>
The retreat functions as a way to introduce new members
to CSDL2, to support evaluation of the prior year, and to facilitate 
planning and process improvement for the upcoming year. 
</ul>

<h4>Industrial Affiliation</h4>

One of the criticisms of the studio paradigm in architectural education is
that the tasks and goals of the studio are quite divorced from the
realities of everyday architectural practice. This problem is endemic to
academic software engineering education as well.  CSDL1 has tried in
several ways to prevent this disconnect between academic training and
professional practice. First, we have focussed on development of
"industrial quality" software products. Second, our research focus has been
quite "applied" in nature--focussing on software review technology, for
example.  Third, we have sought (and obtained) industrial affiliates such
as Tektronix, Digital Equipment Corporation, PICHTR, and Worldpoint,
Inc. Fourth, we have vigorously pursued summer industrial placements for
our students, and achieved 100% placement in Summer of 1997.

<p>

CSDL2 will, of course, continue all of these initiatives from CSDL1.  We
will continue to focus on software problems of direct application to
industrial practice, and the revised training focus in CSDL2 should make
its graduates even more appealing to industry than those from CSDL1.  In
addition, the acquisition of suitable lab space enables an entirely new
form of industrial affiliation possible: physical residency by
representatives of industrial partner organizations within CSDL2.  The
presence of these "industrial fellows" has several substantial benefits.
First, they enable student members to interact on a regular basis with
someone who has been "out in the trenches", and can validate the importance
and practicality of the CSDL2 experience. Second, they can serve as a
"reality check" on CSDL2, making sure that the project, process, and
organizational engineering mechanisms are plausible within an industrial
setting.  Third, by partaking in the daily activities of CSDL2, each
Industrial Fellow receives advanced software engineering training that they can take
back and apply within their own company.  Fourth, they facilitate placement
of CSDL2 students within industry by giving industry representatives a
chance to interact with them over a reasonable period of time. 

<p>

For Fall, 1997, we have a tentative agreement for one Industrial Fellow
within CSDL2: David Brauer, the Vice President of Engineering for
Worldpoint, Inc.  


<h2>Conclusions, and what's next</h2>

If this design of CSDL2 succeeds, it will lead to an environment in which
members can both recognize and generate high quality software products, 
software processes, and software organizations. It will produce a steady
stream of product, process, and organizational innovations, with 
supporting publications that create visibility for the authors within
the community.  This visibility will lead to enhanced professional
opportunities for the members, and help win support for continuation of
the CSDL2 environment.

<p>

The next step is to obtain review and evaluation of this proposal by 
the proposed members of CSDL, by other ICS faculty members, by 
potential members of the Advisory Board, and others interested in 
software engineering education and professional development. If there
is sufficient support for CSDL2, then I hope to proceed toward its 
implementation starting in August 1997.
