Development (TDD) is a relatively new software development process. On the
strength of anecdotal evidence and a number of empirical evaluations, TDD
is starting to gain momentum as the primary means of developing software in
organizations worldwide. In traditional development, tests are for
verification and validation purposes and are built after the target product
feature exists. In test-driven development, tests are used for
specification purposes in addition to verification and validation. An
experiment was devised to investigate the distinction between test-driven
development and traditional, test-last development from the perspective of
developer productivity and software quality. The results of the experiment
indicate that while there is little or no difference in developer
productivity in the two processes, there are differences in the frequency
of unplanned test failures. This may lead to less debugging and more time
spent on forward progress within a development project. As with many new
software development technologies however, this requires further study, in
particular to determine if the positive results translate into lower total
costs of ownership."  }

Extreme Programming. Programming test-first means (1) write down a test-case 
before coding and (2) make all the tests executable for regression testing. 
Thus far, knowledge about test-rst programming is limited to experience reports. 
Nothing is known about the benets of test-first compared to traditional programming 
(design, implementation, test). This paper reports about an experiment comparing 
test-first to traditional programming. It turns out that test-first does not 
accelerate the implementation and the resulting programs are not more reliable,
but test-first seems to support better program understanding."

defect rate by about 50 percent compared to a similar system that was built
using an ad-hoc unit testing approach. The project completed on time with
minimal development productivity impact. Additionally, the suite of
automated unit test cases created via TDD is a reusable and extendable
asset that will continue to improve quality over the lifetime of the
software system. The test suite will be the basis for quality checks and
will serve as a quality contract between all members of the team."}

In this paper, we look at the process relationships within and between these communities as components of a Web information infrastructure. We employ expressive and comparative techniques for modeling such processes that facilitate and enhance understanding of the software development techniques utilized by their respective communities and the collective infrastructure in creating them."
