#summary How to develop techreports using csdl-techreports.
#labels Featured

The csdl-techreports project at Google Project Hosting is designed to facilitate development of LaTeX techreports by members of the [http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/ Collaborative Software Development Laboratory] at the [http://www.ics.hawaii.edu Department of Information and Computer Sciences] at the [http://www.hawaii.edu University of Hawaii] and their affiliates. 

This page provides step-by-step instructions on how to get started using this library. 

== 1.0 Download and install Tex ==

If you have not done so already, you must download a distribution of TeX. We recommend [http://www.tug.org/texlive/ Tex Live].  

If you are using Windows, you should download TeX Live using the installer package made available on the [http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html TeX Live availability page].  (See the section entitled, "TeX Live installation over the internet".)  This involves downloading a file named install-tl.zip, uncompressing it, then double-clicking the file named install-tl.bat to start the downloading process. (This results in downloading over 1800 files which takes several hours on my office machine.)

If you are using Macintosh, you should download the [http://www.tug.org/mactex/ MacTex] package for Tex Live. This involves downloading a file called MacTeX.mpkg.zip (over 1 GB) and double-clicking it to start the installation process. 

== 2.0 Set up a local csdl-techreports workspace ==

Next, create a local csdl-techreports workspace to hold your files.   One way to do this is as follows:

  * Make sure you are a member of the [http://code.google.com/p/csdl-techreports/ csdl-techreports] project. You need to be a member in order to commit changes. 

  * Checkout the entire trunk/ directory, then delete any subdirectories that are not of interest.  In general, you will want to retain at least the styles/, bib/, and 00-00/ subdirectories, as well as any directories containing techreports you are actively working on.  (Alternatively, you can check out the individual subdirectories of interest rather than checking out the entire trunk/, or you can alternatively check out the entire trunk/ and not delete the subdirectories.) 

When finished, you should have a local directory called something like /Users/johnson/csdl-techreports (Unix) or C:\csdl-techreports (Windows) that contains subdirectories styles/, bib/, 00-00/, etc. 

The csdl-techreports/styles directory contains a directory named IEEE_CS_Latex, which contains the LaTeX style used for ICSE and many other conference proceedings of interest to CSDL members. 

== 3.0 Download the UHM Thesis style (optional) ==

Many CSDL members are writing theses using the [http://code.google.com/p/latex-uhm-thesis/ University of Hawaii thesis style].  

If you are writing a tech report using this style, you should download the latest [http://code.google.com/p/latex-uhm-thesis/downloads/list distribution] of this style and unzip it.  

When finished, you should have a local directory called something like /Users/johnson/latex-uhm-thesis (Unix) or C:\latex-uhm-thesis (Windows) containing the files. 

== 4.0 Define environment variables ==

For CSDL tech report development, you need to define three environment variables: TEXINPUTS (which provides a path to style files such as IEEE_CS_Latex), BIBINPUTS (which provides a path to the CSDL bibtex database files), and BSTINPUTS (which provides a path to custom bibliography style files). 

Here are sample definitions for Unix/Macintosh:
{{{
export TEXINPUTS=".:$HOME/csdl-techreports/styles/IEEE_CS_Latex:$HOME/latex-uhm-thesis:"
export BSTINPUTS=$TEXINPUTS
export BIBINPUTS=".:$HOME/csdl-techreports/bib:"
}}}

On Windows, the environment variable definitions will use ';' rather than ':' and '\' rather than '/':
{{{
TEXINPUTS=.;C:\csdl-techreports\styles\IEEE_CS_Latex;c:\latex-uhm-thesis;
BSTINPUTS=%TEXINPUTS%
BIBINPUTS=.;C:\csdl-techreports\bib;
}}}

As you can see, the TEXINPUTS environment variable should point to the directories that contain style file 
definitions.  In this case, TEXINPUTS points to the downloaded IEEE_CS_Latex directory inside the csdl-techreports styles/ directory, as well as to the directory resulting from the expansion of the latex-uhm-thesis.zip file.  

The BSTINPUTS environment variable can normally be defined with the same value as TEXINPUTS. 

The BIBINPUTS environment variable should point to the bib/ directory in the csdl-techreports directory.

== 5.0 Test your installation  ==

=== 5.1 Unix/Macintosh ===

Once you have set things up, you can see if it functions correctly by generating a sample CSDL techreport inside the 00-00 directory. (This is a slightly modified version of the 06-13 techreport). 

Change directories to 00-00 and run the following sequence of commands:

{{{
latex 00-00
bibtex 00-00
latex 00-00
latex 00-00
dvipdf 00-00
}}}

Since it's irritating to run those commands every time, there is a file in the 00-00 directory called "make" that you can invoke as follows to achieve the same effect:

{{{
./make 00-00
}}}

You may need to invoke 'chmod 775 make' to make this file executable. 

=== 5.2 Windows ===

On Windows, you need to use dvipdfm rather than dvipdf, so the appropriate sequence of commands is:

{{{
latex 00-00
bibtex 00-00
latex 00-00
latex 00-00
dvipdfm 00-00
}}}

There is a batch file called make.bat inside the 00-00/ directory that you can invoke to get this behavior as follows:

{{{
make 00-00
}}}

=== 5.3 Sample test run output ===

Here is the slightly reformatted output from running make.bat on Windows (the Unix/Macintosh output is very similar):

== 5.4 The pdf file ==

As a final check, you may want to view the 00-00.pdf file to see that it looks like the CSDL 06-13 technical report. 

== 6.0 Generate your own tech report ==

Once you can generate the 00-00.pdf file locally, you are ready to start developing your own technical report.  To do so, you will generally do the following:

First, contact Philip Johnson to find out what tech report number to use.  For example, all of the technical reports that were started in 2009 begin with "09-". 

Next, create the directory inside csdl-techreports to hold your files.  If your tech report number is 09-04, then the directory should be named "09-04".  

Next, copy the 00-00.tex file and the make files from the 00-00/ directory to your new directory. Rename 00-00.tex to the number associated with your tech report. 

Finally, edit your .tex file appropriately.  Run 'make' as desired to preview your document. 

Be sure to SVN 'add' your new directory and files.  This provides a number of benefits:

  * Your files are backed up in case of a crash.
  * Committing regularly means if you accidentally mess things up, you can revert to a previous version. 
  * You can work on your tech report from multiple computers.
  * Multiple people can collaborate on the same technical report. 

== 7.0 FAQ ==

== 7.1 How to embed images in a LaTeX document? ==
 
The best answer is provided in [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/latextutorial5.html Importing Graphics].  Basically, you must first create a .eps file, then use the graphicx package to insert it.
