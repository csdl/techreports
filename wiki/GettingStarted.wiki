#summary How to develop techreports using csdl-techreports.
#labels Featured

This page provides step-by-step instructions on how to get started using this library. 

== 1.0 Download and install Tex Live  ==

If you have not done so already, you must download a distribution of TeX. We strongly recommend [http://www.tug.org/texlive/ Tex Live], which runs on Unix, Windows, and Macintosh.  

If you are using Windows, you should download TeX Live using the installer package made available on the [http://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html TeX Live availability page].  (See the section entitled, "TeX Live installation over the internet".)  This involves downloading a file named install-tl.zip, uncompressing it, then double-clicking the file named install-tl.bat to start the downloading process. (This results in downloading over 1800 files which takes several hours on my office machine.)

If you are using Macintosh, you should download the [http://www.tug.org/mactex/ MacTex] package for Tex Live. This involves downloading a file called MacTeX.mpkg.zip (over 1 GB) and double-clicking it to start the installation process. 

== 2.0 Set up your local texmf/ directory ==

Different CSDL techreports use different styles, depending upon the requirements of the journal or conference to which they were submitted.  In addition, CSDL has developed a number of different LaTeX bibliography databases (i.e. .bib files) for the various research areas.  To facilitate reuse of these styles and bibliography databases, you should create a local texmf/ directory that will be referenced by the TeX Live system when it runs on your tech report. 

Set up your local texmf/ directory in the following way.

First, create a directory inside your home directory called "texmf".  For example, on my Windows machine, this directory is C:\Documents and Settings\johnson\texmf.  On my Macintosh, this directory is /Users/johnson/Library/texmf.  (Note that on Macintosh, it must be in the Library/ directory.)

Next, SVN checkout the contents of https://csdl-techreports.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/texmf into your local texmf/ directory.  The resulting directory structure should look something like this:

{{{
/Users/johnson/Library/texmf/
                             bibtex/
                                    bib/
                                        csdl-trs.bib, tdd.bib, etc.
                                    bst/
                                       IEEE_CS_Latex/
                                                    latex8.bst
                                       svjour3/
                                               spbasic.bst
                             tex/
                                 latex/
                                       acm/
                                           acm_proc_article-sp.cls, etc.
                                       IEEE_CS_Latex/
                                                     latex8.sty, etc.
                                       svjour3/
                                               svjour3.cls, etc.
                                       latex-uhm-thesis-1.1.0/
                                                              uhthesis2e.cls, etc.
}}}

This is less complicated than it might seem:

  * The bibtex/bib/ directory contains CSDL bibtex database files.  For example, csdl-trs.bib contains citations for all CSDL techreports. Other files contain domain-specific bibtex databases. For example, tdd.bib contains references for test-driven design.

  * The IEEE_CS_Latex/ directories contain [http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/events/icse2009/calls/format/?n=DR IEEE conference style files].

  * The svjour3/ directories contain [http://www.springer.com/math/math+authors?SGWID=0-40017-2-94399-0 Springer-Verlag publication style files].

  * The acm/ directory contains [http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates ACM publications and conferences style files].
 
  * The latex-uhm-thesis-1.1.0/ directory contains [http://code.google.com/p/latex-uhm-thesis/ University of Hawaii thesis style files].

Feel free to add your own .bib files to the bibtex/bib directory.  This enables you to reuse the same bib file across multiple publications.  Remember to SVN add and commit your new file so others can reference it. 

== 3.0 Set up your local techreports directory ==

Now create a directory called "techreports" in a location of your choosing, then SVN checkout https://csdl-techreports.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/techreports into this directory.  The resulting directory structure should look something like this:

{{{
/Users/johnson/techreports/
                           00-00/
                                 00-00.tex, etc.
                           09-01/
                                 09-01.tex, etc.
                           09-02/
                                 09-02.tex, etc.
}}}

As should be obvious, this directory contains the source files for techreports under development, except for 00-00/, which is a directory used for testing your installation, as discussed next.

== 5.0 Test your installation  ==

=== 5.1 Unix/Macintosh ===

Once you have set things up, you can see if it functions correctly by generating a sample CSDL techreport inside the 00-00 directory. (This is a slightly modified version of the 06-13 techreport). 

Change directories to 00-00/ and run a shell script called "make", passing it the name of the tech report:

{{{
./make 00-00
}}}

You may need to invoke 'chmod 775 make' to make this file executable. 

This shell script is quite simple and simply invokes the following:

{{{
latex 00-00
bibtex 00-00
latex 00-00
latex 00-00
dvipdfmx 00-00
}}}


=== 5.2 Windows ===

On Windows, change directories to 00-00/ and invoke the make.bat batch file as follows:

{{{
make 00-00
}}}

This corresponds to the following sequence of commands as in the Unix script.


=== 5.3 Sample test run output ===

Here is the slightly reformatted output from running 00-00/make.bat on Windows (the Unix/Macintosh output is very similar):

== 5.4 The pdf file ==

As a final check, you may want to view the 00-00.pdf file to see that it looks like the CSDL 06-13 technical report. 

== 6.0 Generate your own tech report ==

Once you can generate the 00-00.pdf file locally, you are ready to start developing your own technical report.  To do so, you will generally do the following:

First, "claim" a tech report number by editing the [Directory] page.  If you are unsure of how to do this, contact Philip Johnson.

Next, create the directory inside the techreports/ directory to hold your files.  If your tech report number is 09-04, then the directory should be named "09-04".  

Next, copy the 00-00.tex file and the make files from the 00-00/ directory to your new directory. Rename 00-00.tex to the number associated with your tech report. If you are using Unix and wish to use a more full-featured LaTeX build system, see this [http://code.google.com/p/csdl-techreports/wiki/LaTeXTips#Makefile_for_LaTeX tip about LaTeX makefiles.]

Finally, edit your .tex file appropriately.  Run 'make' as desired to preview your document. 

Be sure to SVN 'add' your new directory and files.  This provides a number of benefits:

  * Your files are backed up in case of a crash.
  * Committing regularly means if you accidentally mess things up, you can revert to a previous version. 
  * You can work on your tech report from multiple computers.
  * Multiple people can collaborate on the same technical report. 

== 7.0 FAQ ==

Check out the [http://code.google.com/p/csdl-techreports/wiki/LaTeXTips tips page] for other useful information once you are up and running.
