= Introduction =

LaTeX may be powerful, but it's not always easy or obvious. This page is intended to collect information about accomplishing particular tasks in LaTeX.

= Tutorials =

These [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/index.html tutorials by Andrew Roberts] are very good. They start at the beginning and work up through most common topics. Note that you should ignore specifics about the computing environment at the University of Leeds.

= Inserting figures in LaTeX =

See the [http://code.google.com/p/latex-uhm-thesis/wiki/FiguresInLaTeX page from the UHM thesis style project]

= Makefile for LaTeX =

If you are doing your tech report work from the command line and use Mac OS X or another Unix-based OS, then the [http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/ latex-makefile] is highly recommended. Download the Makefile, copy it into your tech report directory, and create a Makefile.ini file that contains "onlysources.tex := report.tex" where 'report.tex' is the name of your master LaTeX file (the one that includes everything). Now when you type "make", it will figure out all the dependencies (bibtex, etc) and run them for you until you end up with a PDF file. It also will only show you the log output that is actually useful, eliding all the useless cruft TeX outputs. There are many other cool features, you can read all about them via "make help".

Note that the latex-makefile subscribes to the TeX->DVI->PS->PDF workflow, not the TeX->PDF workflow that pdflatex uses. If you don't understand what this means, see this [http://code.google.com/p/latex-uhm-thesis/wiki/FiguresInLaTeX wiki page] or this [http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/reference/figures.html longer discussion]
