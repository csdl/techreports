= Introduction =

LaTeX may be powerful, but it's not always easy or obvious. This page is intended to collect information about accomplishing particular tasks in LaTeX.

= Tutorials =

These [http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/index.html tutorials by Andrew Roberts] are very good. They start at the beginning and work up through most common topics. Note that you should ignore specifics about the computing environment at the University of Leeds.

= IEEETran Format =

There is a format for IEEE Computer Society publications (journals and conferences) called IEEETran.  It is automatically provided
in the !TexLive distribution, and replaces the latex8 style.  You can learn more from [http://www.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_ieeecs/ieeecs/publications/author/transguide/IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf How To Use IEEETran Document Class], and/or the [http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/ieeetran/ IEEEtran home page]. 

= Always use .eps (encapsulated postscript) for figure format =

Journals often require the LaTeX sources, not just the final PDF.  Thus, you should always generate (or convert) your figures to .eps for inclusion in your tech reports, since they may be useful in future journal submissions on your research. See Appendix D of [http://www.computer.org/portal/cms_docs_ieeecs/ieeecs/publications/author/transguide/IEEEtran_HOWTO.pdf How To Use IEEETran Document Class], or the [http://computer.org/author/transguide/electronicsub.htm IEEE Publication submission guidelines], which explicitly disallow PDF files. 

= Inserting figures in LaTeX =

See the [http://code.google.com/p/latex-uhm-thesis/wiki/FiguresInLaTeX page from the UHM thesis style project]

= Makefile for LaTeX =

If you are doing your tech report work from the command line and use Mac OS X or another Unix-based OS, then the [http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/ latex-makefile] is highly recommended. Download the Makefile, copy it into your tech report directory, and create a Makefile.ini file that contains "onlysources.tex := report.tex" where 'report.tex' is the name of your master LaTeX file (the one that includes everything). Now when you type "make", it will figure out all the dependencies (bibtex, etc) and run them for you until you end up with a PDF file. It also will only show you the log output that is actually useful, eliding all the useless cruft TeX outputs. There are many other cool features, you can read all about them via "make help".

Note that the latex-makefile subscribes to the TeX->DVI->PS->PDF workflow, not the TeX->PDF workflow that pdflatex uses. If you don't understand what this means, see this [http://code.google.com/p/latex-uhm-thesis/wiki/FiguresInLaTeX wiki page] or this [http://amath.colorado.edu/documentation/LaTeX/reference/figures.html longer discussion]

= Footnotes in tables =

There are a variety of ways, but the easiest is to wrap the tabular in a minipage environment. This [http://www.hep.man.ac.uk/u/jenny/jcwdocs/latex/latex.html page has the details].

= \label in tables =

The \label in a table environment (so you can refer to it elsewhere) must be *after* the \caption, otherwise it doesn't work. Arg!

= Cool packages =

Here are a selection of useful LaTeX packages. Some of these you will want to use in most documents, others are more custom. To use them, insert \usepackage{foo} in the preamble of your document (the part before \begin{document}). In some cases the order of the packages matters, check their documentation if you have problems.

 * graphicx: needed for inserting graphics into your document
 * subfigure: allows multiple labeled figures bundled together side-by-side
 * url: make URLs typeset sanely. Without this, you get URLs constantly running off the page
 * xspace: intelligently puts space after user-defined macros (space after macro unless followed by punctuation)
 * fullpage: makes LaTeX's margins less ridiculous
 * hyperref: makes URLs clickable in PDFs, turns references into intra-PDF links, provides \autoref which does intelligent expansion of references (\autoref{tab:foo} becomes "table 2.2"). hyperref rocks, and has many options.
 * breakurl: if you are using dvips (as the [http://code.google.com/p/latex-makefile/ latex-makefile] does), you need this to make clickable URLs linebreak properly
