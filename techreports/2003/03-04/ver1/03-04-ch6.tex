\chapter{Working Schedule}
The content of the thesis work is still under development and I will continue to dynamically update the changes, for instance, adding new theory, designing new experiments, removing the repeated and obsolate ideas. 

Jan 15, 04 - Feb 7, 04
   Use data mining or abstraction ideas to reorganize or refine the chaos Hackystat activity, unit test data to reveal the TDD cycles from Hackystat raw data.
   * Refactor is complicated so do not spend a lot time on refactor
   
Feb 8, 04 - Mar 1, 04
   Do some experiments to study how well the mined data will reflect the actual development process.
   (If possible create some tech reports or conference paper in this period)

Mar 2, 04 - Apr 2, 04
   Revise the thesis content to add upto 30 pages long.
