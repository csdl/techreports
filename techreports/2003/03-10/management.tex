\section{Management Approach}

This project will involve collaborations between three groups:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\em University of Hawaii}.  This group consists of the Principal
Investigator (Philip Johnson), the co-Principal Investigator (Dan Port,
Assistant Professor of Information Technology Management at the University of
Hawaii), and the four graduate student researchers to be funded under this
cooperative agreement;

\item {\em Mission Data System}. This group consists of management and
developers in the Mission Data System group at Jet Propulsion Lab.  Over
the past year, we have interacted most often with Kenny Meyer.

\item {\em SCRover}.  This group consists of management and developers of this testbed
system.  Over the past year, we have interacted most often with Barry Boehm
and Alex Lam. 

\end{enumerate}

We expect that our collaboration will involve approximately 3-4 meetings
per year at JPL or USC, augmented by more frequent teleconferences and
emails as circumstances require.
