\title{From Principle-centered to Organization-centered Design:
       A Case Study of Evolution in a Computer-Supported Formal Technical

\begin{abstract}
  Design of new computer-based environments to replace or augment
  traditional, manual work procedures is typically problematic due to
  its experimental and embedded nature: the requirements for the
  computer-based version of the task may not be well defined, and the
  outcome of introducing computer-based support may well change the
  nature of the task altogether.
   
  This paper illustrates these issues through a discussion of the
  evolution in the design of CSRS, an instrumented, computer-supported
  cooperative work environment for formal technical review.  CSRS was
  originally designed in response to well-recognized shortcomings in
  traditional, non-computer-based formal technical review methods.  The
  initial design was thus founded upon a {\em principle-centered} basis,
  where the system was oriented toward solving known problems in the
  domain of formal technical review.  Over time, the design has evolved
  toward a more {\em organization-centered} basis, in which the system is
  oriented toward support for adoption and use within organizations, even
  if that support conflicts with the ``principles'' of formal technical
  review.  We conjecture that such an evolution may be inevitable in
  experimental and embedded design domains.
