Node lists provide the user with a list of nodes based upon certain
criteria.  AEN provides the user with several built in criteria for
building these lists.  First, AEN allows the user to get a list of all the
nodes of any type.  Second, the user can get a list of all the nodes they
have not read yet or that have changed since the last time they were on
AEN.  Finally, AEN allows the user to get a list of all the nodes they own.
All of the node lists provide the user with a list of nodes from which the
they may select and view. Figure <A HREF="node11.html#fignodelist">3</A> shows what a node list
of unread document nodes would look like.

All of the above mechanisms build upon the basic hypertext document, but we
believe that a plain hypertext document is not good enough for effective
collaboration.  In order to fully support collaboration, there should be a
``physical'' presence in the hypertext document.  Users can
see who else is reading the document, what section they are in and
communicate to any one else using AEN.  These features are difficult to
support by just using hypertext.  The following two mechanisms provide
these features in AEN.
