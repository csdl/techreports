AEN supports two methods for collaborative authoring:<em>proofreading &amp;
trading the lock</em>.  In the proofreading method the author can create
a node and ``publish'' it by changing the read and annotate access for the
document.  Then the other co-authors can make comments about the
document.  The co-author can make simple as proofreading comments or
complex philosophical discussion comments.  The author can then read the
comments and make changes to the document or comment on the comments.  This
can lead to discussions on the contents of the document.  These comments
could be though of as marginal notes.  They could be suggested changes, new
ideas to include, or just general comments on the subject.
<P>
In the trading the lock method the author can create a node and
allow other authors to edit the node by giving them write access to the
node.  When a node is saved all connected users that are viewing the node
see the changes.  In this way two or more authors could trade the lock and
make changes that all the authors will see.
