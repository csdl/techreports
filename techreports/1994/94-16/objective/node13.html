Partyline is a mechanism for passing real time messages to other users of
AEN.  Partyline allows the user to send a textual message to all the users
currently connected to AEN or send a private message to one other user
currently connected to partyline.  This system is similar to the Unix talk
facility. Figure <A HREF="node13.html#figpartyline">5</A> shows a view of the partyline buffer.

Both of these facilities provide services that are similar to walking into
a room containing the other people using AEN.  There are some significant
differences between AEN's Snoopy/Partyline and the walking into a room.
When you walk into a room you can only see the people in the room.  You
have no idea how long the people have been in the room and when people left
the room.  Snoopy gives you that information.  You can see how long ago
people left the room and how long people have been working on their current
task.
<P>
In a room many conversations can go on at the same time and you can listen
to any of the conversations in the room.  Partyline allows you to
``listen'' to conversations that are sent to the entire room. In a real
room it is easy to have two conversations at the same time since we can
tune out other noises.  Partyline does not support two ``global''
conversations well.  Since Partyline is text-based users have to read the
messages.  When the user receives a message they have to at least see who it is
from.  This does not allow them to totally ignore the other conversations in
the room.  If they actually read the message they focus their attention on the
other conversation and may loose their train of thought of their
conversation.
<P>
One special feature that Partyline does allow is to have private
conversations.  In a real room you can tell when people are ``whispering''
to each other.  In partyline there is no indication that two people are
``whispering''.
<P>
Another special feature of Partyline is that it keeps track of
conversations.  If you leave your workstation and don't log out of AEN the
partyline buffer records the partyline conversations.  When you return the
conversations are still accessible in the partyline buffer.  The other
users in AEN will know that you still can ``hear'' the conversations
since, Snoopy tells them that you are asleep if you have not done anything
in a while.  Partyline allows you to be paged.  Even though you might be
asleep the persistence of partyline will tell you you were paged by someone
and then you can respond to the page when you get back.
