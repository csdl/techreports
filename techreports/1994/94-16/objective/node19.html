<P>
The method for this experiment is to collect metrics data generated by both
authors and readers of the hypertext, collect bug reports and suggestions,
and conduct a user survey.  The data will be analyzed both
during and at the end of the experiment.  The metrics will be collected on:<UL><LI>node creation
<LI>reading the contents of a node
<LI>changing the contents of a node
<LI>locking of nodes
<LI>changing the access privileges for a node
<LI>using different tools (ie Table of Contents, Node list, Unread
Nodes)
</UL>
<P>
A questionnaire will be developed to gain information about the users of the
systems and their evaluation of the system.  More
specifically:<UL><LI>How much hypertext experience the users had before the class
<LI>Which tools were the most helpful
<LI>How much each student learned from the class
<LI>Which features were the most convenient to use
</UL>
<P>
AEN has a Feedback menu that allows the users to send suggestions and bug
reports.  These suggestions and bug reports will be analyzed to help answer
the research questions.  The ICS 613 class has periodic meetings.
Suggestions or comments raised in these meetings will also be used to help
answer the research questions.  These suggestions and bug reports will be
classified in the following manner.  Are they inside or outside our
paradigm.  Do they involve a major or minor redesign of the system to
implement.  Are they important or minor.
