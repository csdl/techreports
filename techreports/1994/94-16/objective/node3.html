Over the past 5 months, we have experimented with and redesigned AEN, a
reader and authoring system for hypertext that places equal weight on
supporting (1) on-line collaborative learning, (2) collaborative authoring
facilities and (3) collecting data about user interaction with the
hypertext document.  A fourth requirement of the system is rapid response
time. This system has undergone extensive evolution as we learned more
about the implications of these requirements and their often conflicting
natures.
<P>
AEN is a collaborative, instrumented learning/authoring tool built upon the
Egret hypertext database system <A HREF="node24.html#csdl9309">[6]</A>.  AEN consists of a
hypertext document and several tools to support collaboration.  The
hypertext document represents the text from which the students learn and
the product of collaboration among the participants in the class.
<P>
The initial requirements of AEN were to create a virtual classroom and move
virtually all of the lectures for a class on how to design and construct
collaborative systems using Egret on-line into a hypertext document called
<em>The Annotated Egret</em>.  This class would meet both on-line and off-line
for discussions about issues.  Most of the interaction in the class was
intended to occur through annotation of the lecture material with new
hypertext links to questions, comments, and insights.  A small number of
actual classroom meetings were intended to be a supplementary forum to
discuss things learned or questioned through on-line
activities<A HREF="node24.html#John94">[5]</A>.  The Fall 94 ICS613 class is currently using AEN as
the priciple learning environment.
<P>
The following three sections provide a detailed look at AEN's data model,
tool support and process model for collaborative authoring and learning.
