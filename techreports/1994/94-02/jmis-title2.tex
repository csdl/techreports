\begin{abstract}
  
  Usenet is an example of the potential and problems of the nascent
  National Information Infrastructure. While Usenet makes an enormous
  amount of useful information available to its users, the daily data
  overwhelms any user who tries to read more than a fraction of it. This
  paper presents a collaboration-oriented approach to knowledge
  management and evaluation for very large, dynamic database structures
  such as Usenet. Our approach is implemented in a system called URN, a
  multi-user, collaborative, hypertextual Usenet reader.  Empirical
  evaluation of this system demonstrates that this collaborative method,
  coupled with an adaptive interface, improves the overall relevance
  level of information presented to a user.  Finally, the design of this
  system provides important insights into general collaborative knowledge
  management mechanisms for very large, dynamically structured database
  systems such as Usenet and the upcoming Information Superhighway.
