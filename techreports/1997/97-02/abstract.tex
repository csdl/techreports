Software review is a fundamental tool for software quality assurance. 
Nevertheless, there are significant controversies as to the
most efficient and effective review method. One of the most
important questions currently being debated is the utility 
of meetings.  Although almost all industrial review methods 
are centered around the inspection meeting, recent findings 
call their value into question. In prior research the authors 
of this paper separately and independently conducted controlled 
experimental studies to explore this issue.

This paper presents new research to understand the 
broader implications of these two studies. To do this, 
we designed and carried out a process of ``reconciliation'' 
in which we established a common framework
for the comparison of the two experimental studies,
re-analyzed the experimental data with respect to this
common framework, and compared the results. Through 
this process we found many striking similarities between 
the results of the two studies, strengthening their
individual conclusions. It also revealed interesting 
differences between the two experiments, suggesting 
important avenues for future research.
