The paper source is

From you I need the figures from your paper and the macros you used.

I need the bibliography files you used.

I will put the experiment summaries back in with the experiments. Then
	we should look at writing a joint section that reconciles
	the two experiments. 

Need to have a section in both studies on meeting-sensitive defects
