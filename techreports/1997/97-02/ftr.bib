effect of a two-person inspection method on programmer productivity.
This method is similar to the current larger team method in stressing

The experiment used a Pretest-Posttest Control Group design. An
experimental and control group of novices each completed two
programming assignments. The amount of time taken to complete each
program.  (Time1, Time2) was recorded for each subject. The subjects of
the experimental group did either a design inspection, a code
inspection, or both during the development of the second program. An
analysis of variance was performed and the relationship between Time1
and Time2 was modeled for both groups. A comparison of the models
revealed the experimental group improved significantly in programming
speed as a result of using the two-person inspection. It also appeared
as though this method was more effective at improving the performance
of the slower programmers.

This two-person method could have its application in those environments
where access to larger team resources is not available. If further
research establishes consistency with this method then it might be
useful as a transition to the larger team method.},

Although the problem of writing correct programs, especially those
embedded within large systems or products, remains largely unsolved in
practice, the situation is improving. We can use inspections to further
the investigation into how correct programs are constructed. Several
such inspections will be carried out to determine their usefulness and
refine their practice. The purpose of incorporating correctness
arguments into inspections is not to improve inspections, but to
improve programming. This is not a modest objective. Steps will
necessarily be small.},

Because these inspections delimit the phases of design and development

above-mentioned Standard and this Guidebook is to provide a
framework and model for an inspection process that will enable
the detection and elimination of defects as early as possible in
the software life cycle. An ancillary aspect of the formal
inspection process incorporates the collection and analysis of
inspection data to effect continual improvement in the inspection
process and the quality of the software subjected to the process.},

   ABSTRACT = {  Formal technical review (FTR) is an essential component of all software
  quality assessment, assurance, and improvement techniques.  However, FTR
  exists in a variety of forms, and the process of effectively choosing and
  adopting an FTR technique appropriate to a particular organization is not
  well-understood.  Furthermore, current FTR practice is essentially manual
  in nature, leading to significant expense, clerical overhead, group process
  obstacles, and research methodology problems.
  
  This paper presents results from our research to date on CSRS, an
  instrumented, computer-supported cooperative work environment for
  formal technical review.  CSRS addresses problems in the practice of
  FTR by providing computer support for both process and products of FTR.
  CSRS also addresses problems in the research on FTR through
  fine-grained instrumentation that enables collection of novel forms
  of high quality data about the FTR method currently implemented in CSRS.
  This paper describes CSRS, its instrumentation support, and selected
  findings from its use to explore issues in formal technical review.},

   methods such as inspection are very difficult to adopt
   in organizations: they introduce substantial new up-front
   costs, training, overhead, and group process obstacles.  Sustained
   commitment from high-level management along with substantial
   resources is often necessary for successful technology transfer of
   FTR.
  
   Since 1991, we have been designing and evaluating a series of
   versions of a system called CSRS: an instrumented, computer-supported
   cooperative work environment for formal technical review.  The
   current version of CSRS includes an FTR method definition language,
   which allows organizations to design their own FTR method, and to
   evolve it over time. This paper describes how our approach to

            provide evidence that formal technical review (FTR) can be more
            effective at discovering errors than testing, and that it can
            discover different kinds of errors than testing.  The most
            well-known and widely attempted FTR technique, Fagan code
            inspection, is almost 20 years old and is but one among many
            FTR methods.  Some of these methods successfully challenge the
            conventional wisdom concerning FTR.  Other methods explore the
            impact of computer support for FTR, in contrast to the entirely
            manual nature of inspection.

            This tutorial will provide researchers and practitioners with
            an overview of the spectrum of FTR methods that have been

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), California Institute of
Technology, tailored Fagan's original process of software inspections
to conform to its software development environment in 1987. Detailed
data collected from 203 inspections during the first three years of
experience at JPL included averages of staff time expended, pages
covered, major and minor defects found, and inspection team size. The
data were tested for homogeneity. Randomized samples belonging to the
various phases or treatments were analyzed using the completely
randomized block design analysis of variance (a = 0.05). The results
showed a significantly higher density of defects during requirements
inspections. The number of defect densities decreased exponentially as
the work products approached the coding phase because defects were
fixed when detected and did not migrate to subsequent phases. This
resulted in a relatively flat profile for cost to fix. Increasing the
pace of the inspection meeting decreased the density of defects found.
This relationship held for major and minor defect densities, although
it was more pronounced for minor defects.}

   abstract = {Since the 1970s, non-mechanical review methods have become
very popular as verification tools for software products. Examples of
existing review methods are formal reviews, walkthroughs, and
inspections. Another example is Fagan Inspections, developed in 1976 by
Michael Fagan in an effort to improve software quality and increase
programmer productivity. Fagan Inspections and other existing methods
have been empirically shown to benefit the software development
process, mainly by lowering the number of defects in software early in
the development process. Despite this success, existing methods are
limited. They are not rigorous, therefore, they are not dependable. A
product that has been reviewed with an existing method has no
quantitative qualities that are ensured by the method used.

This thesis presents a new review method, Phased Inspection, that was
developed to be rigorous, reliable, tailorable, heavily computer
supported, and cost effective. Phased Inspection consists of a series
of partial inspections termed phases. Each phase is intended to ensure
a single or small seulness of N-fold inspection during requirements analysis. A
comparison of N-fold inspection with other development techniques
reveals that N-fold inspection is a cost-effective method for finding
faults in the URD and may be a valid technique in the development of
mission-critical software systems.}

  requires the participants to assemble together at the same time and
  place.  This approach is expensive in terms of traveling, scheduling
  and human resources.  Existing computer tools mitigate these
  constraints by adding structure to the meeting, providing on-line
  document support, and distributing the participants over geographic
  boundaries.  The constraint remains, however, that all participants
  participate at the same time.

  We propose relaxing the time constraint in software engineering tasks
  to resolve issues non-concurrently, in effect reducing (and in some
  cases eliminating) the need for the synchronous meeting.  We
  hypothesize that support for asynchrony will enable software
  engineering teams to work together as effectively in different times
  as in same time.

  We have chosen software inspection as our candidate software
  engineering task because it is well-understood, highly-structured, and
  widely-practiced.  We have designed and developed a Collaborative
  Asynchronous Inspection of Software (CAIS) meeting prototype that
  supports the meeting part of inspection.  CAIS allows participants to
  effectively ``meet'' even when separated by time zones and working
  schedules.  We have conducted a pilot study comparing the manual and
  CAIS meetings and present our results and lessons learned.}

A
comparison of N-fold inspection with other development techniques
reveals that N-fold inspection is a cost-effective method for finding
faults in the URD and may be a valid technique in the development of
mission-critical software systems.}

  abstract = {Many software engineering tasks have a synchronous component that
  requires the participants to assemble together at the same time and
  place.  This approach is expensive in terms of traveling, scheduling
  and human resources.  Existing computer tools mitigate these
  constraints by adding structure to the meeting, providing on-line
  document support, and distributing the participants over geographic
  boundaries.  The constraint remains, however, that all participants
  participate at the same time.

  We propose relaxing the time constraint in software engineering tasks
  to resolve issues non-concurrently, in effect reducing (and in some
  cases eliminating) the need for the synchronous meeting.  We
  hypothesize that support for asynchrony will enable software
  engineering teams to work together as effectively in different times
  as in same time.

  We have chosen software inspection as our candidate software
  engineering task because it is well-understood, highly-structured, and
  widely-practiced.  We have designed and developed a Collaborative
  Asynchronous Inspection of Software (CAIS) meeting prototype that
  supports the meeting part of inspection.  CAIS allows participants to
  effectively ``meet'' even when separated by time zones and working
  schedules.  We have conducted a pilot study comparing the manual and
  CAIS meetings and present our results and lessons learned.}
