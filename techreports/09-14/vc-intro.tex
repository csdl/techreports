\chapter{Software Change and Configuration Management}
As Zimmermann and Weiﬂgerber point out in \cite{citeulike:5058462} all of the contemporary version control systems provide certain information about software chainge. In particular, they say that version control system, coupled with a mailing lists and (or) bug and issue tracking system is capable of \textit{saying} \textit{who} changed \textit{what} and \textit{why}. Which seems to be a very reasonable amount of information needed for our judgement about the change - we are able to find statistics of change (LOC added, deleted or changed, files, etc...) and get overall understanding of the change necessety. However, if one would like to know the process behind the change - there is a very little amount of data present in the single transaction.

In order to recover insight information behind a software change 

statistics behind the change can show us some beahvioral patterns 
blanks in the single transactions can be restored by statistics
outliers effect can be diminished by statistics
