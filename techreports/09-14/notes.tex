The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers defines software engineering as 
“the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to development, 
operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering software”
IEEE Standard Computer Dictionary, Institute
of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, New
York, 1990.

"There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to make it so simple 
that there are obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so complicated that
there are no obvious deficiencies."
- C.A.R. Hoare

``Based on our PSP and TSP experience, software engineers can be taught new methods and
convinced to use them. The courses are challenging and require a lot of work but the 
resulting benefits are substantial. The graduate or senior-level undergraduate PSP 
course must be approached more as an experience than an intellectual exercise. 
Merely explaining the methods will produce little or no meaningful benefits. 
The students must work through the course exercises, measure their work, and 
analyze their data to see improved performance. When they do this, the course works. 
If they just read the text or listen to lectures, they are generally wasting their 
own and the professor's time.''
