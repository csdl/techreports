\begin{abstract} 
In my dissertation research, I propose to develop a systematic
approach to automatically inferring software development behaviors using a
technique I have developed called Software Development Stream Analysis
(SDSA). Software Development Stream Analysis is a generic framework
for inferring low-level software development behaviors.  Zorro is an
implementation of SDSA for Test-Driven Development (TDD). In addition,
I designed a series of validation studies to test the SDSA framework
by evaluating Zorro with respect to its capabilities to infer TDD
development behaviors. An early pilot validation study found that
Zorro works very well in practice, with Zorro recognizing the software
development episodes of TDD with 88.4\% accuracy
\cite{csdl2-06-02}. After this pilot study, I improved Zorro system's
inferencing rules and evaluation mechanism as part of my collaborative
research with Software Engineering Group at the National Research
Council of Canada (NRC-CNRC). I am planning to conduct two more
extended validation studies of Zorro in academic and industrial
settings for Fall 2006 and Spring 2007.
