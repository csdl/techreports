<h2 align="center">Improving Software Development Process and Project Management with Software Project Telemetry</h2>
<hr/>
<h2>Post-Defense Change Log</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Elaborated on technology adoption barrier that software development environments outside CSDL might lack telemetry expertise to perform the role similar to the one I performed in the CSDL study (i.e., analyzing process, customizing telemetry analysis, making improvement proposals, etc.) <br>
    <ul>
      <li>p21-22, sec1.7, added another adoption barrier related to lack of telemetry expertise outside CSDL.
      <li>p163, sec8.1.5, devoted a paragraph on telemetry expertise related adoption barrier.
      <li>p170, sec9.2.3, added a summary related to telemetry expertise related adoption barrier.
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Clarified that the method I followed in the CSDL study to generate hypotheses from the data was inspired and thus similar to grounded theory, but they are not the same. My method is a component of the mixed-methods approach I adopted in the study. <br>
    <ul>
      <li>p19, p72, p156, p166. In introduction and conclusion chapters, removed reference to grounded theory by replaced setences like "I collected data, I used the grounded theory approach to generate hypotheses from the data, I tested the hypotheses" with something like "I collected data, I generated hypotheses from the data, I tested the hypotheses."
      <li>p100-101, sec7.3, when disucssing my study design in the CSDL study, I changed wording from "the study was mainly a constructivist study" to "it was a mixed-methods study... it involved many elements from the constructivist paradigm... it also involved an element from the postpositivist paradigm." The same change was also applied in the introduction and conclusion chapters.
      <li>p102, sec7.4, when discussing in detail my data analysis procedures in the CSDL study, I added "the approach I followed to generate hypotheses from the data was inspired by grounded theory....."
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Clarify my evaluation steps in the CSDL study, given Figure 7.4 caused some confusion among committee members. Since the figure does not add additional information, it is removed.<br>
    <ul>
      <li>p100, sec7.3.
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Clarified that I am one of the developers in the CSDL study. Added text to bias and mitigation steps. <br>
    <ul>
      <li>p19, p71, p95, when discussing CSDL environment, I mentioned "three developers were Ph.D. students (including me)".
      <li>p100, sec7.2, researcher's role mentioned that I was developing software in CSDL.
      <li>p101, discussed tradeoff of backyard study.
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Acknowledged in the classroom study the limitation of using telemetry analysis invocation logs to cross-validate anonymous survey results. Since there is an opinion that a true triangulation should match individual student's telemetry invocation log to his/her individual responses, which I am not doing, I replaced the word "triangulation" with "cross-validation" to avoid the controversy. <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Entire dissertation: replaced "triangulation" with "cross-validation".
      <li>p77, sec6.3, acknowledged my cross-validation was partial in nature because the survey was anonymous.
      <li>p90, sec6.5.3, when discussing telemetry analysis invocation records, I also mentioned that I was unable to match individual invocation to individual survey response.
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Added explanation in Ch2 why the cell representing internal software process metrics in Table 2.1 is empty. <br>
    <ul>
      <li>p24, sec2.1, added that the reason why there was no internal process metrics was because all process metrics were dependent on environment.
    </ul>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Rewrite the abstract, reducing the length from 700 to 300. <br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Lots of miscellaneous fixes, such as grammar related to the usage of quotes and periods, spelling, labels in figures, etc. </li>
</ul>
