I would like to thank Dr. Philip Johnson, my dissertation adviser, my mentor, who guided me through my research, who encouraged me in difficult times, and who even spent numerous hours proof-reading my manuscript. This research would not have been possible without you. You have greatly influenced my skill in software engineering and research methodology.

I would like to thank my fellow CSDL members: Hongbing Kou, Mike Paulding, Julie Sakuda, and Austen Ito. You helped me improve my research and make my work environment fun.

I would like to thank my committee members: Dr. Daniel Suthers, Dr. Martha Crosby, Dr. Wes Peterson, and Dr. Daniel Port. Your time and support have been priceless.

Lastly, I would like to thank the Department of Information and Computer Sciences, especially Dr. David Pager, who made my transition from Economics to Computer Science a reality.
