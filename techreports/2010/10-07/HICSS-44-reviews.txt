Dear Robert Brewer -

We are happy to inform you that your paper  The Kukui Cup: a Dorm Energy Competition Focused on Sustainable Behavior Change and Energy Literacy

has been conditionally Accepted with Mandatory Changes to HICSS-44.

Changes specified by the Minitrack chair in this notice must be made prior to final acceptance.  The reviews for your paper 1058 are included below.

By August 31st, you must submit the revised paper in pdf format again to the review site:  https://precisionconference.com/~hicss/

Immediately notify your Minitrack Chair by email that you have re-submitted the paper for further review.

The Minitrack chair will confirm that required changes have been made on the paper. You will then receive a notice of final Accept*  or Reject from the Minitrack chair by email. (Contact your chair directly if you have not received this notice by Sept 10.)

* If your revised paper is accepted, your final paper must be submitted by Sept 15 to a different (publication) site and in source format, and author names must be added.  Instructions for this final publication submission will be included in your final Acceptance notice. A presenting author must register for the conference by Sept 15, as well.

Title: The Kukui Cup: a Dorm Energy Competition Focused on Sustainable Behavior Change and Energy Literacy


Characteristics of Submission


The Review

   This paper presents a generalized set of tools for implementing large
   scale energy monitoring competitions. Namely, they describe the WattDepot
   as a device independent software abstraction tool and Makahiki as an
   aggregation tool for collecting, visualizing, and browsing energy
   datasets by groups and individuals. The authors plan to demonstrate the
   usage of this framework in a dorm energy competition study in the fall
   2010. 

   While typically papers that describe planned studies and research are of
   diminished value, this reviewer found a significant ideas in this work.
   The authors do a nice job outlining the previous work in this area and
   demonstrate a clear need for some more formalized, yet open souse, tool
   for universities (and perhaps others) to run energy usage competitions. 
   The "fostering sustainable behavior" section was of particular value for
   capturing nearly all of the important work and framings for pursuing
   energy conservation (along with their shortcomings). That section alone
   is a nice importing of literature. 

   Some other references that are applicable. Work by Tawanna Dillahunt from
   UbiComp 2009 on energy usage in low income communities echos many of the
   issues involved with energy monitoring with individuals that do not pay
   for energy usage. Also the Pachbue system for uploading and sharing open
   sensor systems should be discussed. There also needs to be a more clear
   distinction of why google power meter cannot simply be used for such a
   dorm level deployment (ie what the primary difference is with the
   authors' system). 

   The authors should also add more discussion to how such a system could be
   expanded outside of the university setting.  For example, individual
   homes. While this issue is mentioned towards the end of the paper, more
   should be said since it represents a significantly important level of
   scaling for such a system. 

   Similarly, more details on the interface and mechanisms for goal setting
   would be tremendously valuable. For example, it was unclear how to track
   progress towards many of the goals. They appeared to be either met at the
   end of the tim period or not. It would be interesting to know if people
   met such goals more often when their name and face we associated with it
   (right now there seems to be only a login name). 

   It would also be really helpful to understand the importance of
   monitoring energy usage on-the-go. That is, dorm floor usage while at
   class or dinner using a mobile phone. Again the authors mention this in
   passing but further elaboration needs to be made. It was unclear if a
   mobile app would be provided to students in the study for example or
   perhaps more relevant if the Facebook plugin would be functional? 
   Studies of such elements of the system would be extremely valuable to the
   community. 

   Finally, there is also mention of a lobby electronic display. This would
   seem to be a major component of the system in that it would remind
   building occupants of the state of the competition and publicly announce
   various inhabitants goals. However, very little detail is given for this
   prat of the system and no designs shown. It would seem that this would be
   an essential part of any such dorm competition so providing examples of
   how such public displays can be developed with the authors tools should
   be demonstrated. This is also because various designs for persuasive
   displays may span visual, audio, and/or tangible modes. It should be easy
   for others to design such elements that support these designs as well
   using the authors' tools. 

   Overall, this paper presents an interesting take on existing technologies
   for energy monitoring and provides a new framing for using and deploying
   such infrastructure. The real value of the paper will come after the
   deployment and post interview studies. However, the ideas presented and
   at least the details of the start of the study (which should be included
   in the paper) are likely to provide valuable discussion points for
   practitioners attending the conference.
