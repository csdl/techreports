<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This paper provides one review of the comparative
strengths and weaknesses of <A
HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/LOCC/LOCC.html">LOCC</A> and <A
HREF="http://sunset.usc.edu/research/CODECOUNT/index.html">CodeCount</A>,
two tools for calculating the size of software source code.  The next
two sections provide quick overviews of CodeCount and LOCC.  The final
section presents the perceived strengths and weaknesses of the two tools.
A caveat: although I am attempting to be objective in this review, I have 
in-depth knowledge of LOCC and only very superficial knowledge of
CodeCount.  Comments and corrections solicited and welcomed.


<h2>CodeCount</h2>

The incarnations of CodeCount can be divided into two basic flavors.  The first
flavor, which I will dub as "Classic" CodeCount, has been in production use
for over a decade.  The second flavor, dubbed "CSCI" CodeCount, is the
result of a set of student projects to support various "object" languages
by extending Classic CodeCount.

<p>

Classic CodeCount is a relatively old and mature project.  The first work
on Classic CodeCount began in the late 1980's.
CodeCount reflects its early origins in three
important ways.  
<ol>
<p><li>It is written in ANSI C, with all the typical
strengths (speed) and weaknesses (lack of higher level program structuring
mechanisms, etc.) of that language. 

<p><li> It was originally designed to
provide size metric information appropriate to the kinds of languages
targetted at that time
(assembly languages and non-OO languages such as C and Fortran).  Classic
CodeCount does not employ a grammar and so has cannot reliably recognize object
oriented language structures within a file, such as packages, classes,
methods, inner classes, etc.  

<p><li> It has been used extensively by many
industrial partners for over a decade, and has presumably been used to
count many millions of lines of code.  It can be presumed to be well-tested 
and reliable for the kinds of measures it produces.
</ol>

<p>
Here is an example of the kind of output produced by CodeCount:

<p>

"CSCI" CodeCount appears to be a collection of student projects done in the
past year or so to modify the original code count tool to support "object"
languages.  The level of counting sophistication appears to be constrained
by the design of Classic CodeCount.  Essentially, the code was modified
with the addition of counter variables to count the occurrence of
method/function declarations, and the output routines were enhanced with to
print the number of methods/functions found in the file. CSCI Code Count
provides this kind of support for languages like HTML, XML, Excel,
JavaScript, C/C++. etc.

<p>
As a result, CSCI CodeCount output consists of the standard Classic
CodeCount output, interspersed with additional output lines
indicating the number of objects found.  Here is an excerpt of CSCI 
CodeCount output illustrating the kinds of object information provided:

<h2>LOCC</h2>


Unlike CodeCount, work on LOCC began relatively recently. Joe Dane started
work on LOCC in 1998, and the first public release occurred in 1999.  LOCC
arose from our earlier work on a system called JavaLOC.  Interestingly,
JavaLOC was a Java-based lines of code counter for Java source that was
designed in a manner quite similar to CodeCount, in that it was not
grammar-based. However, it attempted to go beyond CodeCount by determining
the number of lines of code in each individual method in a Java class, then
summing those to determine the number of lines of code in a entire class,
and summing the class sizes to determine the size of the corresponding
package.
<p>

Calculating this "hierarchical" size data at these differing grain sizes of
methods, classes, and packages (as opposed to files) has significant
advantages: you can determine things like the average number of methods per
class, the distribution of method sizes, and so forth.  Concrete
applications of this information include triggering for inspection any
methods that exceed a certain size, or characterizing the size of "small",
"medium", and "large" methods for project estimation. 

<p>

After struggling with JavaLOC for about a year, we came to the conclusion
that a non-grammar-based approach to providing such "hierarchical" size
data was unmanageable: the system's algorithms were kludgey and either
failed or produced incorrect results rather frequently.

<p>
Joe Dane, the original developer of LOCC, recognized that a grammar-based approach
would provide a robust approach to providing hierarchical data, and as a
bonus, could allow the system to be designed so that new languages could be
supported simply by "plugging in" a new grammar. He found a Java-based
parser generator called JavaCC that provided appropriate infrastructure and 
grammars for many popular languages.
<p>
As well as designing the system for ease of extension to any language with
a JavaCC grammar, he also designed the system for ease of extension to
different input and output formats.  Thus, there are command line,
programmatic, and GUI input formats, and text, Leap data file, and csv (comma
separated value) output formats.  Here is some example output in text format
from LOCC for the canonical HelloWorld program:

<pre>
Java Source: HelloWorld.java (6)
Number of Classes: 1
Number of Interfaces: 0
Number of Methods: 1
Package: 
 Class: HelloWorld (5)
1 Method(s):
  Method: main (3)
</pre>

As you can see, LOCC provides the total LOC for the entire file (6), the
total LOC for the class (5), and the total number of classes and methods (1
each), and the total LOC for each method (3 LOC for main).

<p>

LOCC, however, does something quite useful beyond providing a hierarchical
size-based measurement of the total lines of code in one or more files. It
also produces a "structural diff" by comparing two versions of a system,
matching classes and methods (by name), and determining the number of lines
of code that were changed in each method, class, package, etc.  After
making some minor modifications to the canonical HelloWorld program, the
text output for the "diff" between the two versions might look as follows:

<pre>
Size Difference Info for HelloWorld.java
2 lines added in method main
0 lines added in class HelloWorld
0 lines added in package 
</pre>

This indicates that two lines were added (or simply modified) in the main
method, that no lines were added/modified in the class HelloWorld apart
from the method-level modifications already listed, and that no lines were
added/modified in the package apart from those already indicated at the
class level. 

<p>

At least in our experience, this "diff" mechanism is even more useful than
the "total" mechanism, because most projects do not start from scratch.
Instead, in an incremental development scenario, 
a developer wants to estimate how many previously written methods
might be "touched" and how many new methods might be written in the
upcoming increment of the project.  LOCC's diff method provides a much more
accurate measure of these changes than simply computing the total LOC
before and after the project increment. For example, an increment of
development might not change the total size of the system significantly,
but might require extensive rewriting of many hundreds of lines of code.

<p>

Although the LOCC output examples are from trivial programs, it has been
used to count systems of significant size. For example, it was used to count the
size of a Java system over 500,000 lines of source code.

<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses of CodeCount and LOCC</h2>

Given this difference in background and functionality, here are some
factors to keep in mind when deciding whether to adopt CodeCount or LOCC:

<ul>
<P><li><em>Execution speed</em><br>
CodeCount is written in C, and utilizes relatively simple algorithms to
recognize comments and physical/logical lines.  LOCC is written in Java,
and builds a parse tree before counting.  Although we have done no timing,
we expect that CodeCount is faster than LOCC.  However, LOCC counted a large
  Java software system of over a half a million lines of code in less than a
  minute, so any execution speed differences are probably not important from a
  usability perspective.

<P><li><em>Reliability and Correctness</em><br> CodeCount has been used
much more extensively than LOCC, and so one would predict that, all other
things being equal, it would be more reliable as a result.  However all
other things are not equal, since LOCC uses a more robust, grammar-based
approach to counting, which could potentially result in more accurate
counts in certain circumstances.&nbsp; One of the industrial users of LOCC told
  us that they switched to LOCC from CodeCount because LOCC counted code
  correctly in circumstances where CodeCount did not.&nbsp;


<P><li><em>Documentation</em><br>
Both CodeCount and LOCC appear to be well documented.  CodeCount 
documentation includes a 
number of powerpoint presentations, a specification for logical and
physical LOC for each language, and copious in-line comments in the source
code.  LOCC documentation includes the thesis by Joe Dane, a user and developer guide,
and copious in-line and JavaDoc documentation in the source code. 


<P><li><em>Ease of general maintenance</em><br>
CodeCount is a smaller system than LOCC, and is less complicated in certain 
respects, which increases the ease of maintenance.  LOCC enjoys the
maintenance  benefits 
of object-oriented language constructs, as well as Java-specific
documentation features such as JavaDoc.  Finally, Joe utilized various
design patterns to help structure the code for understandability and
maintenance. 

<P><li><em>Ease of extension</em><br>

The "CSCI" CodeCount flavor illustrates the kinds of extensions that are
easily possible with CodeCount. They also illustrate the limitations.
Based upon our experience with JavaLOC, we do not believe CodeCount can be
extended to provide LOCC style size information, such as accurate counts of
the size of individual methods in multiple languages. We conjecture that
such an extension would lead to a complete reimplementation that
incorporates a grammar-based approach.  On the other hand, we conjecture
that it would be relatively straightforward to extend LOCC to produce the
information currently reported by CodeCount.

<p>

Extension of CodeCount also typically involves copying and modification of
the entire source code, resulting in replications of the system.  In
contrast, LOCC support for all languages, input formats, and output formats
is provided in a single system.  For all of these reasons, LOCC appears to
be the more extensible of the two systems.


<P><li><em>Compatibility</em><br> CodeCount is the clear winner if
compatibility with the COCOMO estimation mechanism is required or desired.
CodeCount also wins if compatibility with companies already using CodeCount 
is desired.  LOCC wins if compatibility with the Leap toolkit or its
successor is desired.  


<P><li><em>Portability</em><br>
Both CodeCount and LOCC appear to be quite portable to different operating
system and hardware platforms. 

<P><li><em>Availability of source code</em><br> Source code for both CodeCount
  and LOCC is available as a downloadable zip file.&nbsp;  


<P><li><em>Licensing</em><br>
Source code for CodeCount is provided under the terms of the USC-CSE
Limited Public License.  Source code for LOCC is provided under the
terms of the GNU Public License.  


</ul>

There may be additional important factors that are not included here.
Please let us know and we will add them to this report.
