\section{Project Budget}
%No more than 1 page

The project budget consists of two items: a desktop system which will be
used to do the actual development of the software, and a server which will be
used to test the server software. A development system is necessary because the
development will be done after I have graduated thus preventing me from using
UH facilities. The separate server unit will be necessary because the server
will have to be located somewhere with permanent Internet access (possibly
colocated with an ISP) in order to actually test the filtering.
