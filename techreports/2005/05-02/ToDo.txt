NSF Things to do:

* Rewrite to use CEDAR acronym; 
* Request augmented NSF prior results data from Brian;
* Create proposal in fastlane;

  Vic: 6483843, pin: 52668
  Brian: 6482784 

Editing changes:
* New hackystat info:
  - Sensor-based data collection (quantitative data)
  - Daily Diary screen dump (cli plus active time)
  - Telemetry screen dump
  - Analysis page screen dump
 
* Need a picture of the federated server diagram for CedarNet.

* Bring in secure authorization via Shibboleth.

* Maybe move qual/quant section up to front of related work.  Need to
explain more about why we're presenting the information that we're
presenting.  Also need to call out prior research by PI Feldman and
Pentland more explicitly.  We need to call out the 'unresolved issues' and
unsatisfied requirements of the qualitative/quantitative section more
explicitly. 

* Qual/quant needs to talk about sensor-based data collection with
Hackystat; how that allows scalability in the kinds of data that can be
collected.

* In research plan, begin by overviewing the unresolved issues raised in
the related work section, and saying that they effectively form the high
level requirements for our cyberinfrastructure.  We might want to organize
the research plan into two subareas: CyberInfrastructure Development and
CyberInfrastructure Evaluation.  

* Need to think about precisely how the case study would work.  We could
start with a combination of studies in the classroom using Basili stuff,
plus within Sun.  Then we figure out a way to integrate these two together.
We then figure out how to publicize the data to all partners.  Then see if
we can obtain buy-in from DARPA to make CEDAR the standard mechanism for
empirical data collection and dissemination; this kind of coerces buy-in.
If that happens, then we can move to figuring out how to deal with other
vendors, etc. Alternatively, we hope that the availability of meta-analysis
mechanisms and the ease of use for Cedar is its own motivating factor. 


Next week:
* Request letter of support from Larry.
* Send Jeremy nsf.pdf + program directors; request back-channel.
