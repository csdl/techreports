foo
Software project telemetry is a new approach to software project

management in which sensors are attached to development environment tools

to unobtrusively monitor the process and products of development. This

sensor data is abstracted into high-level perspectives on development

trends called Telemetry Reports, which provide project members with 

insights useful for local, in-process decision making.  This paper presents

the essential characteristics of software project telemetry, contrasts it

to other approaches such as predictive models based upon historical

software project data, describes a reference framework implementation of

software project telemetry called Hackystat, and presents our lessons

learned so far. 



\end{abstract}



\Section{Introduction}

\label{sec:intro}



It is conventional wisdom in the software engineering research community

that metrics can improve the effectiveness of project management.

Proponents of software metrics quote theorists and practitioners from

Galileo's ``What is not measurable, make measurable'' \cite{Finkelstein82}

to DeMarco's ``You can neither predict nor control what you cannot

measure'' \cite{DeMarco82}.  Software metrics range from internal product

attributes, such as size, complexity, and modularity, to external process

attributes, such as effort, productivity, testing quality, and reliability

\cite{Fenton97}.

  tools directly invoked by developers (such as Eclipse or Emacs) as

  well as to tools implicitly manipulated by developers (such as CVS or 

  an automated build process using Ant).}
