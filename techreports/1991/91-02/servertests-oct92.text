Hi,

	This time I could not reproduce the error that I encountered
earlier i.e s*node*make "xxx" gives a wrong-arguments message.  So I
take my words back.
	I had to comment all the operations which has a void function
call.  Normally this fails with an appropriate error message, but for
the s*node@reset- operation, the test run goes into a never ending
state.  There are still a few failed cases with the error message 'nil
not an snode' and 'write-attribute failed' and I am not sure about
the cause of this error.  Maybe Dadong and Danu can tell what it is.

Thank you

-Kiran
