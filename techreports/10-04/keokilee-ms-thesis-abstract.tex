\begin{abstract}
Because of our ever-increasing population and our limited natural resources, improving the energy literacy of the population is becoming increasingly important.  A way to promote these habits is to hold energy competitions to see who can reduce their energy usage the most.  A popular place to hold these competitions are in University dorms, where students are making the transition from living with their parents to living on their own.  Holding these competitions are a great way to educate the student population, but the development of the competition can be costly.  Besides prizes for the winning individuals/dorms, creating and maintaining a development website can take a lot of time.  Some groups have turned to software development firms that provide the software and hardware, but at a cost.

We propose a system called Makahiki that will provide a free, open-source, and easy to implement solution.  Using other open source tools such as WattDepot, we aim to create a configurable package for organizations who hope to hold their own energy competitions.  To test our implementation, we will be holding a dorm energy competition here at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in October 2010.  We will also test the configurability of our system by implementing another organization's dorm energy competition website.
