\section{INTRODUCTION}


The explosive growth of the Internet and WWW has provided new opportunities
to experiment with collaborative technologies formerly limited to research
systems and sophisticated user communities.  This paper describes an
attempt to exploit the opportunity of the Internet and WWW to provide a
collaborative system for use by the general public to support
telecommunications policy planning in the State of Hawaii.

This computer-mediated, collaborative planning process must ultimately be
considered a failure, even though the design appeared sound, the
implementation was solid, and preliminary use seemed acceptable.  This
paper presents our effort to explain why this happened and how future
developers of public CSCW systems can benefit from our experiences.
 
The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a background
on the telecommunications policy planning process surrounding Project
HI-TIME. The following section briefly describes the design and
implementation of the Project HI-TIME system.  The next section details the
operational life of the Project HI-TIME system. The final section
presents our hypotheses as to why Project HI-TIME did not succeed, and 
recommendations to designers of public CSCW systems.

This paper describes one attempt to provide a collaborative system
for use by thousands of people in the general public to support
telecommunications policy planning in the State of Hawaii. 

This attempt must ultimately be considered a failure, even though the
design appeared sound, the implementation was solid, and preliminary use
seemed acceptable. For reasons which are not completely clear, we built
a system and nobody came.  This paper presents our effort to explain why
this happened and what future CSCW implementors can do to avoid this
fate.

The paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a
background on the telecommunications policy planning process surrounding
Project HI-TIME. The following section briefly describes the design and 
implementation of the Project HI-TIME system.  The next section details
the short operational life of the Project HI-TIME system. The final section
presents our hypotheses as to why Project HI-TIME did not succeed in the
form of recommendations to designers of public CSCW systems.
