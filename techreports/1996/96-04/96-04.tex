\abstract 

In early 1995, the State of Hawaii began work on an ambitious revision to
its telecommunications policy planning process.  A multidisciplinary team
was commissioned to develop a proposal for an iterative, interactive,
computer-mediated collaborative planning process whereby the State's
telecommunications infrastructure plan could be developed and periodically
upgraded to reflect technology and policy shifts in local communities. The
proposal included a sophisticated, CSCW software system called HI-TIME
which would both enact the planning process as well as provide access and
visibility into the planning process for the general public.  In early
1996, the ambitious collaborative planning process, including the
implemented, deployed HI-TIME system, was abandoned in favor of a more
traditional approach. This paper explores the rise and fall of Project
HI-TIME and the lessons it holds for developers of CSCW systems.
