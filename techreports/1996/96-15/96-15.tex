\chapter{Introduction}
\section{What is PSP}
\subsection{Basic description}
\subsection{Who developed it and when?}
\subsection{Current environments where it is used}
\subsection{How widespread is it?}
\subsection{Why do people want to use it?}
\section{PSP can be difficult to learn}
\subsection{Many forms}
\subsection{Multiple processes, so as user learns PSP, familiar forms change}
\subsection{Complicated computations with higher PSP levels}
\subsection{Instructions in textbook not always clear}
\subsection{Data interdependencies between forms complicated in higher PSP levels}
\section{PSP is time-consuming to use even after learning it}
\subsection{Many forms with many fields to fill out by hand, at the same time as coding}
\subsection{Tedious computations at the end of even minor projects}
\subsection{When computations rely on historical data, finding the data takes time}
\section{Analyzing PSP data is time-consuming}
\subsection{Finding the right data on the right form of each project takes time}
\subsection{Even when using spreadsheets, an extra step is added to each project}
\subsection{Doing even part of the computations by hand is a big job}
\subsection{Users tend to do only a few kinds of data analysis because of the work involved}
\section{Thesis of this research}
\subsection{Automation of the PSP will result in faster and more accurate collection of PSP data.  Analysis of this data will also be faster and users will look at the data 
in more ways.}
