      <h1>PSP/Baseline SRS Multi-Way Two-Person Review Procedure</h1>



This document presents a procedure for multi-way two-person reviews.

<ol>
<p><li>  Begin by reading the entire document carefully. 

<p><li> Next, work through the procedures in the accompanying checklist. Most
ask you to answer one or more questions. The intent is that in
answering the question, you will discover defects or opportunities for
improvement.  You should write down your answers to the questions
in preparation for the meeting with the author. You can create a simple
ASCII file for your answers, or use pencil and paper if you prefer.

<p><li> Record each defect (either an outright error or else a change that
would make the SRS higher quality) you discover in 
the CSDL/Baseline DRL, using the defect type classification list provided.
You can use the paper DRL form provided, or create a .drl file manually.

<p><li> After working through the checklist, read the document once more
to look for any additional defects. 

<p><li> Record the time spent on review in the CSDL/Baseline TRL. You can
use the paper TRL form provided, or create a .trl file manually.

<p><li> When you are finished, send email to the document author and
arrange a time to meet.  At this meeting, you will discuss your 
answers to the questions and the list of defects you have recorded.

<p><li> You can ask questions or request clarifications from the 
author or any group member at any time. 

</ol>
