<P>
The distribution dimensions characterizes how a system communicates state
information from a producer to its consumer or consumers.  There are two
basic mechanisms: queries, in which the consumer requests state information
explicitly, and signals, in which the system distributes state information
to clients without their having asked for it.
<P>
In general, the query distribution mechanism is better for 
rarely used but frequently changing state information, since
the cost of sending signals to maintain the correct value 
at a client is not justified by the use of this information.
For example, the idle time value associated with a user
tends to vary frequently, but this state information might
be rarely useful to other clients.
<P>
Conversely, state information which changes infrequently and
unpredictably, but is used often by clients is a good candidate for
signals. For example, state information concerning the set of users
currently connected to a client might be used every few seconds by
a system, though it changes only every few minutes or hours.
Such information is best communicated through signals.
<P>
CSCW architectures can support just one or both of these
distribution mechanisms.  A further distinction can be made
between those systems that hardwire the distribution mechanism
for a particular type of state information, and those that
allow applications to choose the distribution mechanism best
suited to their purposes for the state information in question.
