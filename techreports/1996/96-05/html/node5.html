<P>
The trigger dimension focuses on what events or constructs in the system 
trigger the collection of state information.
<P>
The most obvious trigger is a user action. Examples of user actions
that can trigger the collection of state information include mouse
clicks, artifact retrieval, artifact creation, interaction with another
user, and so forth.
<P>
Another potential trigger is the structure and/or content of artifacts.
For example, a system can react to the creation of an artifact of type
``e-mail'' by creating state information concerning when, where, and by who
this e-mail was created, and what it's intent was. (Such state information
is useful to a system implementing a ``speech act'' paradigm, in
which the state of the system must include a representation of communication
between users and the state of the conversation, though not the actual
e-mail itself.)
<P>
External events also serve as triggers to state information collection.
For example, some systems ``wake up'' each day at midnight to perform
certain supportive analyses on the state of collaboration.
