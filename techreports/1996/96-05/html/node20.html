<P>
To gain a visceral sense for the differences between
collaboration-the-large (CITL) and collaboration-in-the-small (CITS),
consider the following two activities of the Collaborative Software
Development Laboratory, which are typical in many organizations.
<P>
First, we maintain the WWW Archive on Formal Technical Review (FTR), which
is a structured software engineering group process for improving software
quality.  This archive receives a substantial amount of traffic and
receives contributions from many groups world-wide.  The mode of
collaboration for the FTR Archive is one of collaboration-in-the-large:
while we gather occasional statistics on aggregate usage, it is unimportant
(in fact, it would be distracting) for us to be continuously aware of who
is using the archive, where they are in it, what they have seen before,
what they should look at next, what their reaction is to the current
material they are looking at, and so forth.  For systems such as the FTR
Archive, collecting, representing, and responsively presenting state
information about users, artifacts, and processes would not only be
computationally expensive, it would be counter-productive to the
collaborative activity for both us and our users.  For a broadly popular
web-site, such as Yahoo, such state processing would be prohibitive.
<P>
In contrast, consider Flashmail, a very simple collaborative system used
extensively by members of CSDL. Flashmail attaches a menu to an editor
window which, when pulled down, displays a list of members, whether they're
logged on, which workstation they're using, and the idle time associated
with that workstation. For any logged in member, one can send a textual
message that appears immediately in a window covering their current screen,
regardless of which application it is. Flashmail is thus a deliberately
intrusive communication facility based upon real-time awareness of the
location and activity of others in a group. The canonical Flashmail message
is, ``I'm hungry. Do you want to go to lunch?''  Flashmail is an excellent
example of collaboration-in-the-small, because there is an intrinsically
limited number of people for whom a user might desire such real-time
awareness, much less allowing them to interrupt in the midst of other
activities.
<P>
Our experiences with state lead us to conjecture that there is a
fundamental difference between systems designed to support
collaboration-in-the-large, involving thousands or millions of people, and
collaboration-in-the-small, involving from a handful to dozens of people.
This difference manifests itself at both the conceptual and architectural
levels. Conceptually, CITL appears to demand a ``collaborative open world
assumption''. Users cannot know, with any level of accuracy, the boundaries
and contents of the system (including users, artifacts, and processes) at
any single point in time. CITS, on the other hand, appears to demand the
opposite: a closed world in which relatively complete knowledge about
users, artifacts, and processes is explicitly represented and immediately
accessible.  The closed world assumption permeates the Egret architecture
at every level, as does the open world assumption in the WWW's. We
conjecture that this relationship is not incidental, but essential. We
invite the CSCW community to consider with us the following question: what
would constitute appropriate architectural support for
collaboration-in-the-medium?
