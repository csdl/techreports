\abstract

This paper overviews the Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN), a system designed
to support {\em strong collaboration} among a group as they cooperatively
build, review, revise, improve and learn from a structured hypertext
document.  AEN addresses how strong collaboration can be supported through
computer mediation.  It is designed to support collaborative creation of
hypertext and to instrument the actions of its users in order to understand
how such creation occurs.

\paragraph{KEYWORDS:} Hypertext, Strong Collaboration, Authoring
\section{INTRODUCTION}

With the rapid expansion of the World Wide Web (WWW) \cite{Berners-Lee94},
the use of hypertext as a structuring mechanism for richly interdependent
information is becoming widespread.  Indeed, hypertext is almost certain to
be the `lingua franca' of the information superhighway.  The WWW allows
authors to collaborate by including sections of other authors' documents.
Unfortunately, WWW provides little support for collaborative authoring
beyond including someone else's work.

The issues associated with collaborative authoring have been investigated
by many researchers.  Baecker et. al. \cite{Baecker93} provide several
requirements for collaborative writing systems.  They include: preservation
of identities, enhanced communications, enhanced collaborator awareness,
annotations, undo, session control, explicit roles, variety of activities,
transition between activities, several document access methods, separate
document segments, version control, one or several writers, and synchronous
and asynchronous writing.

This paper reports on my investigation into the issues related to
collaborative hypertext document construction.  Specifically, my
investigation and my characterization of a form of collaboration termed
{\em strong collaboration}.  In strong collaboration, each participant
contributes to the construction of the document, and gains new knowledge as
a direct result of this construction.  The constructed document is not
simply a patchwork of individual contributions, but instead, an
incremental, emergent synthesis that reflects the knowledge created by the
group as a whole.  In general, strong collaboration most often (though not
always) occurs in non-computer mediated, face-to-face contexts such as a
group software design session or an interactive classroom setting.  A
distinguishing characteristic of strong collaboration is a sense of
collective authorship over most, if not all of the components of the
document.  Documents produced in this way should be of higher quality,
because more perspectives have combined to produce, review, and correct
errors in it.

Strong collaboration is at one end of a collaborative spectrum.  I call
the other end of the spectrum {\em weak collaboration}.  Weak collaboration
uses a divide and conquer process --- participants divide up the document
and work independently on their section.  There is very little interaction
between the participants.  When all of the sections are finished, the
document is created by combining the sections into a whole.  A
distinguishing characteristic of weak collaboration is distinct authorship
of components of the document.  

Computational support for weak collaboration is well established.  For
example, word processors or editors allow different authors to create
subsections of a document and combine them together.  E-mail can deliver
different sections of a document to an editor who compiles them.  In
contrast, the computational needs of strong collaboration are not well
established.  For example, very few editors allow more than one author to
edit the same document at the same time.  In order to understand strong
collaboration, I implemented a collaborative hypertext authoring
environment called the Annotated Egret\footnote{Exploratory Group Research
EnvironmenT} Navigator (AEN).  This environment provides tools designed to
encourage strong collaboration and measurement facilities designed to
detect strong collaboration, if it were to occur.

AEN is built upon Egret \cite{csdl-93-09}, a client-server hypertext
database manager.  Authors/learners use AEN's typed nodes and links to give
the hypertext document structure.  They also use an access control model to
dynamically restrict the type of access to the individual nodes in the
database.  Several autonomous agents help AEN manage all of the information
needed to support strong collaboration.

The ability of AEN to support strong collaboration was evaluated through a
case study during the Spring of 1995.  The study looked for strong
collaboration, recorded the tools used, and asked the users for their
opinions of the tools provided by AEN.

In order to detect strong collaboration, I developed a metric for each
component of the operationalized definition of strong collaboration. Table
\ref{tab:op-metrics} summarizes the operationalized definitions and their
corresponding metrics.

I used these collaborative metrics to detect occurrences of 
collaborative behaviors.  In order to evaluate AEN's set of tools, tool use
was monitored and a post study survey asked the participants their
impressions of the tools.

The data analysis reveals that a high score for each metric was recorded by
at least one of the groups studied.  However, no single group scored high
on all five metrics.  These results indicate that AEN does support the
various components of strong collaboration, but the results do not
demonstrate that AEN allows a single group to collaborate strongly with
respect to all metrics simultaneously.  Section \ref{sec:evaluation} explores
the results of the case study in detail.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  Section
\ref{sec:related-work} examines other collaborative learning and authoring
systems.  Section \ref{sec:AEN} introduces AEN.  Section
\ref{sec:evaluation} is a discussion of how I evaluated AEN's design and
its support for strong collaboration.  Section \ref{sec:conclusions}
presents some conclusions and recommendations about strong collaboration.
Section \ref{sec:future} discusses future directions for AEN.


\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}

This chapter surveys major existing hypertext or collaborative editors,
with a comparison of AEN to these systems.  Subsection \ref{sec:collab-sys}
discusses different collaborative writing systems.  Subsection
\ref{sec:hypermedia} compares several hypermedia systems with AEN.

AEN's set of features were designed to explore and support strong
collaboration. Subsection \ref{sec:mechanisms} provides a detailed description
of AEN's features.  AEN provides a typed hypertext document, dynamic user
defined table of contents, real-time communications with other users of the
system, real-time knowledge of what the other users of the system are doing,
and access control for each node.  Other collaborative writing systems or
hypermedia systems provide different combinations of features.

\subsection{Collaborative Writing Systems}
\label{sec:collab-sys}

These systems support the process of collaborative writing.  Not all of the
systems in this subsection are pure collaborative writing system, but they all
support the process of collaborative writing.  I have divided the
collaborative writing systems into three categories, weakly collaborative,
additive, and synchronous.

The weakly collaborative systems are MILO \cite{Jones93} and NSF Express
\cite{Greenberg91}.  They appear to only support the combination of
different types of documents from different authors.  They do not appear to
support co-editing of other authors' work while they are still working on
it.

The additive systems are CLARE \cite{csdl-93-21}, ConversationBuilder
\cite{Kaplan92}, ForComment \cite{Ellis91,Opper88}, InterNote
\cite{Malcolm91}, gIBIS \cite{Conklin88}, and MarkUp! \cite{Allen93}.
These systems allow authors to collaboratively add to a document.  Three
different systems, CLARE, ConversationBuilder and gIBIS will be discussed
briefly.  They provide a good cross section of these types of tools.

The last category of collaborative writing systems, is synchronous.  The
following are examples of this category of system: Aspects
\cite{Allen93,Baecker93}, Augment \cite{Engelbart84}, CES
\cite{Ellis91,Greif87}, CoAUTHOR \cite{Bowers91}, CoEd \cite{Ellis89},
COOPerator \cite{Michels95}, EHTS: Emacs HyperText System \cite{Wiil92},
GroupWriter \cite{Malcolm91,Malcolm93}, PREP \cite{Neuwirth90,Neuwirth92},
Quilt \cite{Fish88}, SASE and SASSE \cite{Baecker93}, SEPIA \cite{Haake92},
and ShrEdit \cite{Cogn92}.  All of these systems appear to support
synchronous editing of documents by multiple authors.  In general, they do
not support different modes of access control.  Many do have a presence for
the authors of the document. 

\subsection{Hypermedia Systems}
\label{sec:hypermedia}

This subsection reviews several other hypermedia systems that are not directly
oriented toward collaborative writing.  These systems include: CoMEdiA
\cite{Santos92a,Santos92b,Santos93a,Santos93b}, Intermedia
\cite{Conklin87},  NoteCards \cite{Halasz87},  The
Virtual Notebook System \cite{Shipman89}, and the World Wide Web
\cite{Berners-Lee94}.

\subsection{Summary}

One key feature that distinguishes AEN from the other systems is its
specific intent to support strong collaboration and to be a tool to help
investigate collaborative construction of hypertext documents.  AEN's set of
features is guided by the desire to support and explore collaboration.




\section{AEN}
\label{sec:AEN}


\subsection{Architecture of AEN}
\label{sec:architectureAEN}

AEN is a collaborative, instrumented learning/authoring tool implemented
with the Egret collaborative system development
environment\cite{csdl-93-09}.  As with all Egret domain-specific
applications, AEN is a client-server system running over TCP/IP, where
clients (implemented as customized versions of XEmacs) interact with a
central server called HBS (implemented in C++) to store and retrieve
information or communicate with other clients.  AEN makes substantial use
of Egret's facilities for agents, or autonomous client processes that
extend the system's information processing capabilities beyond those
provided by HBS or the clients.  Figure \ref{fig:aen-architecture}
illustrates AEN's basic client-server architecture.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=client-server.eps,width=5in}} 
  {\em AEN consists of a central server called HBS that provides basic
  storage and concurrency control mechanisms, augmented with several agent
  processes to support strong collaboration.}
 \caption{AEN's architecture from an OS process perspective.}
\label{fig:aen-architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The design of AEN}
\label{sec:designAEN}
\subsubsection{Structure of Data in AEN}

AEN provides facilities for storage, retrieval, and analysis of a hypertext
network of node and links. The hypertext network represents the text from
which the students learn and the product of collaboration among the
participants.  AEN provides a static, predefined set of node and link
types.

\paragraph{Node Types}

At the user-level, AEN provides two type hierarchies of nodes: artifact
nodes and figure nodes.  Nodes of type {\em artifact} represent textual
information in the hypertext document.  Nodes of type {\em figure}
represent graphical information.

Artifact nodes contain ETML\footnote{A primary difference between the Egret
Text Markup Language (ETML) and HTML is that ETML supports {\tt egret::}
URL specifier for link and node objects within an HBS server.} code that
provides formating directives and inter-node links.  There are four
subclasses of artifacts:

\begin{itemize}

\item{\bf Document:} Nodes that contain the text of the document created by
the participants.

\item{\bf Comment:} Nodes containing the reactions of the participants to
the contents of other nodes.

\item{\bf Quicky Quiz:} Nodes that contain exercises for the participants
to complete.

\item{\bf Quicky Quiz Answer:} Nodes that contain the participant's
solutions to the quicky quiz nodes.

\end{itemize}

Quicky Quiz and Quicky Quiz Answer nodes are used in AEN to support
learning.  They can be ignored for collaborative authoring.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=Data.eps,width=5in}}
  \caption{Data Relationships in AEN}
  \label{fig:Data}
\end{figure}

Unlike artifact nodes, figure nodes contain the graphics data used by Xview
to display the figures.  Users can create links from artifact nodes to
figure nodes or other artifact nodes by a simple menu-based command.  Such
an operation results in both the creation of a new link object within the
server and the creation of an ETML link anchor as part of the contents of
the artifact node.  However, since figure nodes contain graphical
information, compatible with Xview, rather than ETML code, users cannot
create links from figure nodes.  Figure \ref{fig:Data} shows the
relationships between the node types.

\paragraph{Link Types}

AEN defines six types of links: Include, Xref,
see\_Quicky\_\-Quiz, see\_\-Quicky\_\-Quiz\_\-Answer, see\_\-Comment, and
see\_Figure.  AEN restricts the type of the source and destination nodes
for each type of link. Table 2.1 describes the different
links.  The different types of links allows the authors to create different
structures in the hypertext document. 

\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Link Types}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
      \hline
      Link Type&Source Node&Destination Node&Description\\ \hline \hline&&&\\ 
      Include&document&document&Backbone structure \\
      &&&of hypertext document\\ \hline
      Xref&document&document&Cross reference\\ \hline
      See\_Comment&Any&comment&Points to a Comment\\ \hline
      See\_Quicky\_Quiz&Any&Quicky Quiz&Points to a Quicky Quiz\\ \hline
      See\_Quicky\_Quiz\_&Quicky Quiz&Quicky Quiz&Points to a\\
      Answer&&Answer&Quicky Quiz Answer\\\hline
      See\_Figure&Any&Figure&Points to a Figure\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:types}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


\paragraph{The AEN Backbone}
\label{sec:aen-backbone}

Given the set of node and link types in AEN, there are many possible ways
to organize the resulting hypertext network.  However, given the intended
usage of AEN, it is natural and appropriate to provide a fundamental
organization of the hypertext as an ordered sequence of interlinked,
hypertext ``chapters'', each hypertext chapter having as its root a single
document node.

Each document node with a link to it from a chapter node represents a
``section'' within that chapter. In the same manner, each document node
with a link to it from a section node represents a subsection within that
section, and so forth ad infinitum.

Any document node can, of course, have a link to it from more than one
other document node in the hypertext, with the result that the same node
can be a ``section'' with respect to one node, but a ``sub-subsection''
with respect to another.  As a result, the AEN hypertext is organized as a
directed, hierarchical, but potentially cyclic graph structure.

So far, this description seems to indicate that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between each document node and each chapter, section,
subsection, and so forth in the document.  The reality is slightly more
complex.  Each document node does contribute at least one new chapter, or
section, or subsection, etc. to the hypertext.  However, if a document
node contains the HTML {\em heading} formatting directive, then the label for
this heading indicates a new section (or subsection, etc. depending upon
context) within the node.

To bootstrap this organization, some distinguished ``root'' document node
is required, which I call the AEN Backbone.  This node contains a set of
links to document nodes which define the set of top-level chapters in AEN.

The AEN Backbone and the nested structure of document nodes defines the
major organizing principle for the AEN hypertext, and leads to the first
data manipulation tool: the table of contents screen, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:Screen1}.  The next section discusses the table of contents screen
and the other data manipulation tools. 



\begin{figure}[htb]
 \centerline{\psfig{figure=screen1.ps,width=6in}}
 {\em This screen shot shows a portion of this 
 user's table of contents in the upper left screen, and a retrieved
 document node called ``Design'' in the upper right screen.  The Design
 node contains within it both a link to a figure called ``Figure 1'' and a
 comment called ``Regions'' immediately after it (represented in the
 Design node by the textual anchor ``[??]''.  Both the figure and the
 comment are retrieved and displayed in the screens in the lower left and
 lower right hand corners, respectively.}
 \caption{Screen Shot of AEN's Main display, a comment node, a figure node,
 and TOC.}
 \label{fig:Screen1}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Mechanisms for Data Manipulation in AEN}
\label{sec:mechanisms}

For browsing, AEN emulates many of the facilities of WWW browsers such as
Mosaic or Netscape.  Each node is displayed in a separate screen, and
multiple nodes can be displayed simultaneously.  The contents of nodes are
automatically reflowed to conform to the size of the screen.
Middle-clicking over a link anchor retrieves the corresponding node from
the server.  As noted above, AEN supports storage and retrieval of both
text and graphics, and although audio is not currently available in AEN, it
has been implemented in other Egret-based applications, and could be easily
added.  Due to a limitation in the current release of XEmacs, in-line
graphics are not currently available in AEN.

Where AEN begins to depart from WWW systems is in its support for
authoring and collaboration.  First, AEN provides an authoring mode
for nodes, including menu and command key-based formatting directives
for headings, lists, and fontification, link anchor creation, and so
forth.  Second, all artifact nodes must be locked before they can be
modified.  Locking preserves the integrity of information when
multiple authors are working on a document, but provides only basic
support for collaboration.  AEN augments locking with an access
control mechanism, discussed next.

\paragraph{Access Control}

AEN implements three forms of access to individual nodes: read access,
write access, and annotation access.  The administrator(s) of a node can set each
form of access independently for each user of AEN.

When no access is provided to a node, then that node is essentially
private and can be retrieved and edited only by the administrator(s) of the
node. (The creator of a node is given the status of ``administrator'', which
has the effect of irrevocably providing all forms of access. Only the
administrator[s] of a node can delete the node.)

When a user has read access for a node, they can retrieve it but they
cannot add a link to it or edit its contents. Providing only read access to
a node to others indicates that the information is available for use, but
not for review or feedback.

When a user has both read and annotation access for a node, they can both
retrieve it and add a link from the node to a newly created comment
node. Providing both read and annotation access indicates that the
information is available for use and that comments from others about the
content of the node are welcomed.  Annotation access allows the administrator of
the node to solicit suggestions for changes to the contents of the node,
while still retaining control over whether those changes are actually
applied to the document.

When a user has both read and write access for a node, they can both
retrieve it and lock it for editing.  Providing both read and write access
signifies the desire for the closest form of collaborative development, in
which those with write access can make arbitrary changes to the contents of
a node.

Of course, the administrator of a node may grant all three access rights to another
user, which allows them to select which form of feedback to provide.  It is
also interesting to note that without read access, neither annotation nor
write access is useful, since one cannot annotate or lock a node without
first retrieving it.  This is actually quite useful in practice, since it
allows the administrator of a node to temporarily ``hide'' a node simply by
disabling read access to the group.  By re-enabling read access, the
previous annotation, and write access are all reinstated.


\begin{figure}%[htb]
 \centerline{\psfig{figure=screen2.ps,width=6in}}
 {\em This screen shot illustrates some of the real-time support
for strong collaboration in AEN.  The Snoopy window in the lower right hand
corner shows, for each user of the system, whether or not they are logged
in currently and if so, where they are working in the document.  Both user
cmoore and user jeremyt are working on the document node called ``Shared
Emacs''.  The Partyline screen, in the lower right hand corner, allows these
users (as well as all others) to talk to each other while they work.  This
figure also shows a local TOC for the Shared Emacs chapter, and a screen
displaying the current set of unread document nodes for this user.}
 \caption{Screen Shot of AEN's Main display, Snoopy, Partyline,  Node List
 and TOC.}
 \label{fig:Screen2}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Context-Sensitive Table of Contents}

The access control mechanism determines which nodes a user may read and
what they may do to the node once they have read it, but it does not help
the user determine which node they want to read.

The primary navigation mechanism  provided by AEN is {\em tables of
contents}.  Each table of contents (TOC) is a dynamically generated, linear
traversal of document nodes in the database, organized according to the AEN
Backbone structure described in Subsection \ref{sec:aen-backbone}.  Figures
\ref{fig:Screen1} and \ref{fig:Screen2} each contain an example of a table
of contents.  Each line in a TOC is mouse-sensitive, and middle-clicking on
it retrieves the corresponding node (or section within a node) from the
server.  The indentation of headings provides a visual cue to the
hierarchical structure of the hypertext.  Once the TOC is displayed the
user can collapse or expand the listing to reduce or enlarge the number of
listings present.


AEN generates a TOC based upon a starting node that the user chooses.  The
TOC algorithm only analyzes document nodes for which the user has read
access, thus, the TOC is both location and user-specific.  The algorithm
only visits the children of a node once, which breaks cycles in the
hypertext. Finally, each time a document node is written to the server,
structural information relevant to the TOC is extracted, cached, and
propagated to all clients if it has changed. Such a mechanism is crucial to
the usability of the system; one cannot retrieve every document node from
the database each time a TOC is generated.


\paragraph{Node Lists}

The tables of contents provide the most important perspective on the
hypertext---that of the document-level structure, but other viewpoints are
also useful.  Users can make queries for nodes satisfying various criteria
with the node-list mechanism. In AEN, useful criteria so far include the
type of nodes, whether or not the nodes have been retrieved by this user
yet, and the nodes owned by the user.

Each node-list returned from a query consists of a mouse-sensitive
list of node names appearing in a single screen. Middle-clicking
on the node retrieves it in the standard fashion for AEN navigation.

The Hyperstar Bulletin \footnote{The name of this mechanism is a pun on the
name of Honolulu's evening newspaper: the Star-Bulletin.} is an agent-based
mechanism intended to support collaboration via a daily ``snapshot'' of
what has changed in the database since each user last visited it.  The
Hyperstar Bulletin consists of an agent process that wakes up at
approximately 4 a.m. each morning and sends a daily electronic
``newspaper'' to each participant containing a listing of which nodes (for
which the user has read access) have been created or changed since the last
time the user logged in. 


\paragraph{Snoopy and Partyline}

The mechanisms described above support the construction of a hypertext by
multiple authors, but falls short of support for strong collaboration in
one crucial way.  With these above mechanisms alone, the actual people
involved in the collaborative activity are ``invisible'' within the system:
their effects upon hypertext document are visible, but they themselves are
not.  To create a physical presence for participants within the system, AEN
provides two additional facilities: Snoopy and Partyline, as illustrated in
Figure \ref{fig:Screen2}.

The Snoopy mechanism allows the user to see who else is at work and have an
idea of what they are working on.  It displays basic information about the
connection status and last read node of the users of AEN. A Snoopy screen
is created automatically each time a user connects to AEN, and is updated
every 30 seconds.  Through Snoopy, each user knows who else is currently in
AEN and where they are in the hypertext.

Partyline is a mechanism for passing real time messages to other users of
AEN.  Partyline allows the user to send a textual message to all the users
currently connected to AEN or send a private message to one other user
currently connected to Partyline.  Partyline is similar to an Internet
``chat'' mechanism.  Typically, users greet the other people when they
log in to AEN with Partyline messages.

Both facilities provide access to the users of AEN.  In order to help
support strong collaboration, users of AEN need access to the other users.
Snoopy and Partyline provide this service.


\section{Evaluation of AEN}
\label{sec:evaluation}


AEN was used during the Fall semester of 1994 in a graduate seminar on
collaborative systems in the Department of Information and Computer
Sciences at the University of Hawaii. The initial requirements document for
AEN \cite{csdl-94-06} was developed in June, 1994. Precise and accurate
metrics data for only a small portion of the Fall semester was collected by
AEN, due to volatility in both AEN and the metrics system.  Approximately
285 hours of active use of AEN were logged during the second half of the
Fall semester by ten participants.  Approximately 800 nodes and 800 links
were created during the semester by the class.

In Spring, 1995, I conducted an evaluation of AEN's support of strong
collaboration for my Master's thesis.  Three groups of five undergraduate
and graduate students used AEN to develop requirements documents for an
undergraduate software engineering course.  Over the course of the study,
the three groups spent over 180 hours using AEN. They created 100 document
nodes, 111 comment nodes, and 5 figure nodes.  All of the groups in the
study demonstrated some degree of strong collaboration in their
requirements documents.



This section presents the results from the evaluation of AEN during Spring,
1995.  Subsection \ref{sec:data-overview} briefly overviews the results of the
groups' usage of AEN.  Subsection \ref{sec:AEN-supports} presents the
evaluation of AEN's support of strong collaboration.  Subsection
\ref{sec:Tools} discusses the major features of AEN that were designed to
support strong collaboration.  Subsection \ref{sec:eval-AEN} presents the
evaluation of AEN as a collaborative tool.  Subsection \ref{sec:bottom-up}
closes this chapter with a brief description of the three groups'
procedures for collaboration.

  \label{tab:summary}
\end{table}  
\normalsize

At the end of the study, I analyzed the database, metrics, bug reports,
user suggestions and user surveys.  Table \ref{tab:summary} provides a
summary of the statistics of the three groups.  Over the course of the
study, the three groups spent over 180 hours using AEN. They created 100
document nodes, 111 comment nodes, and 5 figure nodes.  There were large
differences in how the different groups and members used AEN.  Thirteen of
the fifteen users returned their post-test surveys.

The bug reports for Fall, 1994 were compared with the bug reports for
Spring, 1995.  I classified the bug reports into three categories, system
bugs, data corruption bugs, and user misunderstanding.  The system bugs
category describes bug reports on errors caused by AEN doing something
wrong. For example, the following is a system error bug report from the
Spring, 1995 case study. 


\small
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
Description of what happened: 

I tried to quit(AEN menu) after closing the Partyline 
window but I couldn't. 

I got error message :
Error signalled by u*error system: gi*partyline, 
invalid-db-ID, recoverable
  \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\normalsize


The data corruption category is for bug reports describing an error in
the HTML data stored in a node. For example, the following is a data
corruption bug report from the
Fall, 1994 case study.


\small 
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
Description of what happened: 

Inaba's "Help by QUESTION" node under the AEN tutorial
cannot be retrieved.  (invalid link-ID).  Can you
please repair this corruption?
  \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\normalsize


The user misunderstanding category is for bug reports that describe an
error that is due to the user's misunderstanding of AEN.  For example, the
following is a data corruption bug report from the Spring, 1995 case study.


\small
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
Description of what happened: 

I am just curious why when I type in the "less than sign" 
is gives me '&lt;' instead.  I am not able to make some html 
statements without the sign.
  \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\normalsize


AEN's has a menu item that allows the user to insert a $<$ character instead
of the HTML code, ``\&lt;''.

Table \ref{tab:bugs} shows the numbers and classification of bug reports
submitted during the two semesters.  There were seven fewer bug reports
during the Spring, 1995 use of AEN than the Fall, 1994 use.  Of the Spring,
1995 bug reports, 56\% were due to system errors.  In Fall, 1994 75\% of
the bug reports were due to system errors.  Interestingly, the number of
user misunderstandings is larger in the Spring, 1995 usage.  This may be
due to the experience difference in subjects.  In Fall, 1994, AEN was used
by graduate students and in Spring, 1995, AEN was used
by undergraduates.  %This could be due to??

This study investigated two questions. First, does AEN support strong
collaboration? Second, does AEN's set of tools promote collaboration?  The
next section discusses how well AEN supports strong collaboration.

\subsection{Does AEN support strong collaboration?}
\label{sec:AEN-supports}

To answer this question, each of the metrics for each component of the
operationalized definition are examined in turn.  The analysis of each
metric presents two sets of numbers, one relating to all of the nodes owned
by the group, the other focusing on the only the nodes that appear in the
group's final requirements document.  For the purpose of the this
evaluation, I will look only at the groups' document nodes, since the
comment nodes are for feedback purposes.  I do not expect collaborative
editing on a comment intended as feedback.  In order to say that AEN does
support the strongest collaboration possible, a single group must
demonstrate all four components of the operationalized definition of strong
collaboration presented in Subsection \ref{sec:operationalized-definition}.

\subsubsection{RPN: Readers per Node}

The first metric I will look at, is the readers per node (RPN) metric. For
this study, the lowest RPN value is one, indicating that no member of the
group read any nodes other than those he created.  The highest possible RPN
value is five, indicating that every member read every node.  Each group
in the study behaved differently with respect to RPN.

\paragraph{Group A}

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:A-reading}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Table \ref{tab:A-reading} shows the RPN breakdown for Group A.  Group
A had the full range of readers per node values.  They had a fairly even
distribution of nodes with different readers per node values.  Even in the
final document, they still had a wide range of readers per node values,
unlike the other groups.  One quarter of their final document had 2 readers
per node, while 37.5\% of the nodes had five readers.  Group A's RPN
value for their final document is 3.6, the lowest RPN value for the three
groups.  However, this value is still in the top half of the RPN range.

\paragraph{Group B}

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:Ku-reading}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Group B had the same range for their readers per node values as
Group A, but their distribution was very different than Group A's.  Figure
\ref{tab:Ku-reading} shows their readers per node values and RPN values.
Over 80\% of all their nodes had one or five readers per node.  In their
final document, they did not use any nodes with fewer than four readers per
node.  Their RPN value, for their final document, was 4.8.  Their RPN value
is much higher than Group A's. It is in the top 4\% of the RPN range.

\paragraph{Group C}

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}  
  \label{tab:Na-reading}
\end{table}
\normalsize


Group C had the largest clustering of reader per node values near the
ends of the scale.  Table \ref{tab:Na-reading} shows the RPN breakdown for
Group C.  All but two of their nodes had one or five readers per node.
In their final document they only chose nodes that had five readers per
node.  They demonstrated the highest possible RPN value (5) in their final
document.


All three groups had RPN values in the top half of the RPN scale.
The next metric looks at collaborative editing of nodes. 



%\subsubsection{MCE: Member Co-editing}
%
%This metric focusses on the members and whether they work together.  To do
%this it looks at the collaboration from a ``group dynamic point'' of view.
%How does the group collaborate to construct the document?  The range of
%possible collaboration modes in this study range from, members only editing
%their own nodes, a score of one, to each member editing with every other
%member, a score of five.  In the strongest editing each member would have a
%MCE score of five.

\subsubsection{EPN: Editors per Node}

The Editors per node (EPN) metric calculates the average number of editors
per node.  The lowest EPN value possible for this study is one, indicating
that each node was only edited by one member.  The highest possible EPN
value is five, indicating that every node was edited by all five group
members.

\end{table}
\normalsize

Group A was the only group to not have a single node that had all five
members edit it.  Figure \ref{tab:A-editing} shows the EPN breakdown for
Group A.  For all the nodes that Group A created, 79\% of the nodes had
one or two editors per node.  In their final document, only 37\% of the
nodes had three or more editors per node.  Group A's EPN value of 2.7 for
their final document, is in the lower half of the EPN range.  Group A's
EPN values are the lowest of the three groups.

\paragraph{Group B}

Group B's distribution of editors per node is very different than Group A.
Table \ref{tab:Ku-editing} shows the EPN breakdown for Group B.  Almost a
third, 29\%, of all their nodes had four or five editors per node.  In
their final requirements document, they had an EPN value of 4.3.  This
value is in the top 20\% of the EPN range.  Group B's EPN value is the
highest EPN value of all three groups.

\paragraph{Group C}

Group C also had high values for their editors per node.  Table
\ref{tab:Na-editing} shows their breakdown.  Group C's distribution of
editors per node values was very similar to Group B's.  However, for the
final document, only 70\% of their nodes had four or five editors per node.
In contrast, 86\% of Group B's nodes had four or five editors per node.
Group C's EPN value for their final document was 3.8, which is in the
upper half of the EPN range.


This subsection discussed one way to provide input on a node of the document ---
direct editing.  Another way to provide input is to create feedback or
comment nodes.  The next section discusses the feedback creation metric of strong
collaboration, FNC.

\subsubsection{FNC: Feedback Node Creation}

The Feedback Node Creation (FNC) metric in combination with EPN helps define
how much collaborative input occurred. The creation of feedback nodes gives
an indication how much discussion is going on among the authors of the
document.  FNC calculates the percentage of document nodes that have been
commented on. The lowest possible FNC value is 0\%, indicating that no
document nodes were commented on.  The highest FNC value is 100\%,
indicating that all document nodes were commented on.  
\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Feedback Nodes.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf FNC metric for
      all groups}\\ \hline
      Group&All Nodes&FNC&Final Doc Nodes&FNC\\ \hline
      \hline
      A&10&29.4\%&8&50.0\%\\ \hline
      B&8&19.5\%&6&42.9\%\\ \hline
      C&4&16.0\%&2&20.0\%\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:feedback}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Table \ref{tab:feedback} shows the number of comment nodes and the FNC
values for each group.  Different collaboration styles can easily be seen
in the different FNC values.  Group A, with an FNC of 50\%, used comments
widely, while Group C, with an FNC of 20\%, hardly used any comments
at all. 
% These higher FNC values might explain group A's lower EPN scores

The next component of the definition is how the users control the access to
the nodes.

\subsubsection{NAC: Non-default Access Control}

The Non-default Access Control (NAC) metric is the first of two access
control metrics.  It calculates the percentage of nodes that have had their
access control changed from the default.  The lowest NAC value possible is
0\%, indicating that no nodes had their access control changed from the
default.  This also indicates that there was no interaction among the
members since the default access control is no access for other members.
The highest possible NAC value is 100\%, indicating that every node has had
its access control modified.

\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{NAC Breakdown.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf NAC metric by group}\\ \hline
      Group&All Nodes&NAC&Final Doc Nodes&NAC\\ \hline
      \hline
      A&26&76.5\%&16&100.0\%\\ \hline
      B&23&56.1\%&14&100.0\%\\ \hline
      C&16&64.0\%&10&100.0\%\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:access-control}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Table \ref{tab:access-control} shows the NAC values for each group.  In the
final document, 100\% of the nodes for all groups had their access control
changed.  This is not surprising.  Since all groups had RPN values for their
final documents greater than one, the access control for all those nodes
must have been changed to allow other members access to the node.  The
relatively high NAC value for A's total document implies that they
created fewer ``private'' nodes.  Private nodes are nodes whose access
control does not let any one else read or change them.

\subsubsection{EAC: Evolving Access Control}

The second metric dealing with access control is Evolving Access Control
(EAC). It calculates the percentage of document nodes that have had their
access control changed more than once. This metric measures the degree to
which the groups' collaboration changed. The lowest EAC value possible is
0\%, indicating that no nodes had their access control changed more than
once.  The highest possible EAC value is 100\%, indicating that all nodes
had their access control changed more than once.

\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{EAC Breakdown.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf EAC metric by group}\\ 
      \hline
      Group&All Nodes&NAC&Final Doc Nodes&NAC\\ \hline
      \hline
      A&7&21\%&7&44\%\\ \hline
      B&2&5\%&1&7\%\\ \hline
      C&2&8\%&1&10\%\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:d-access-control}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Table \ref{tab:d-access-control} shows the results for the EAC metric.  All
three groups evolved the access control for a few of their nodes.  Group
A, which so far has had the lower metric scores in RPN and EPN, greatly
out scores the other two groups in EAC.  The absolute values for EAC are
low, 44\%, 7\%, and 10\%.  However, a high score in EAC represents a
dynamic collaborative process.  I did not expect the three groups to have
very dynamic collaborative process, because of their low experience with
group collaboration and because they had never collaborated together.

\subsubsection{Summary}


Does AEN support strong collaboration?  In order to answer positively, at
least one group must demonstrate strong collaboration in their hypertext
document. Figure \ref{fig:op-def} shows a view of all the metrics for each
group.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=metrics.eps,width=6in}}
 \caption{Summary of Groups' Collaboration Metrics.}
 \label{fig:op-def}
\end{figure}

Since no one group had uniformly high values for their five metrics, I
cannot say that any group collaborated in a ``purely'' strong manner on their
document.  This does not mean that AEN does not support strong
collaboration. There could be some obscure interaction between the five
major features of AEN that prevents a single group from having high scores
in all five metrics, but I do not believe this is true.

The one or more of the three groups showed high values for the RPN, EPN and
NAC metrics.  For the FNC and EAC metrics, group A scored 50\% and 44\%,
indicating that they used AEN to comment on and change the collaborative
style of their document.  Based upon the high scores in RPN, EPN and NAC
and Group A's ability to demonstrate the other two components of the
operationalized definition of strong collaboration, I claim that AEN is
capable of supporting strong collaboration.

Let us look at the specific features that AEN uses to support strong
collaboration.

\subsection{AEN's Features}
\label{sec:Tools}

AEN's set of features was designed to support and encourage collaboration
between members.  The features were developed during the Fall, 1994 semester
and evaluated in the Spring, 1995 semester.  This section discusses the
five major features provided by AEN in support of collaboration: access
control, tables of contents, node lists, Snoopy and Partyline.


\subsubsection{Access Control}

As discussed above, each group used the access control mechanisms during
the case study.  I hoped the design of access control would promote
evolving access control.  In other words, the access to a node would change
over the lifetime of the node reflecting the different states of
completeness and collaboration.  AEN's access control model was a partial
success.  All the groups did use the control mechanism to restrict access
to the node, but they did not use its evolutionary nature to significantly
change their mode of collaboration.


For each of the remaining four major features, I will present the usage
data and the survey results.  The usage data will compare the number of
sessions each user had and the number of instances they used the tool (when
this information is available).  The survey results indicate the tools'
helpfulness and their frequency of use.  The survey questions (see Appendix
\ref{app:questionnaire1} and \ref{app:questionnaire2}) ask the user to rate
different aspects of AEN from a scale of one to nine, with one being poor
and nine being good.

The first two features, tables of contents and node lists, are
navigation aids that help the users find their way around the hypertext
document.  The tools should help the users get to the interesting nodes of
their documents.  The last two tools, Snoopy and Partyline, are designed to
provide a sense of physical presence in the hypertext.  Each will be
discussed in turn.

\subsubsection{Context-Sensitive Table of Contents}
\footnotesize
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{TOC Creations.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|c||c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{9}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Tables of Contents}\\
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group A}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group B}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group C}\\ \hline
      Member&TOCs&Sessions&Member&TOCs&Sessions&Member&TOCs&Sessions\\ \hline
      \hline
      A1&10&7&B1&12&9&C1&11&16\\\hline 
      A2&10&10&B2&36&36&C2&38&17\\ \hline
      A3&66&49&B3&49&40&C3&17&17\\ \hline
      A4&20&18&B4&28&18&C4&14&15\\ \hline
      A5&9&9&B5&16&17&C5&25&25\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:A-TOC}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The table of contents (TOC) was the most used tool provided by AEN.  Table
\ref{tab:A-TOC} shows the number of times each user created a TOC vs. the
number of their sessions.  Since AEN does not automatically create a TOC,
the metrics show exactly how many times the users created tables of
contents.  Each group usage pattern of the TOCs is different.  Group A
created TOCs more often than the other groups.  Group C and B
are very close in their numbers.


\small
\begin{table}
  \caption{Survey Questions about Table of Contents. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Table of Contents}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      I used the Table of Contents:&8.7&0.7\\ \hline
      The Table of Contents is helpful:&8.3&1.3\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-TOC}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The survey results in Table \ref{tab:survey-TOC} show that the users felt
they used the TOC very often (8.7 out of 9, with a very small standard
deviation).  The users also thought that the TOC was a very helpful tool,
average score of 8.3.  

The next feature, node lists, complements tables of contents as a navigation
aid.

\newpage
\subsubsection{Node Lists}

\footnotesize
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Node List Creations.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|c||c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{9}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Node Lists}\\
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group A}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group B}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group C}\\ \hline
      Member&Lists&Sessions&Member&Lists&Sessions&Member&Lists&Sessions\\ \hline
      \hline
      A1&0&7&B1&2&9&C1&36&16\\\hline 
      A2&4&10&B2&5&36&C2&30&17\\ \hline
      A3&4&49&B3&5&40&C3&7&17\\ \hline
      A4&16&18&B4&20&18&C4m&28&15\\ \hline
      A5&1&9&B5&44&17&C5&0&25\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:A-Node List}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The groups' use and feelings towards node lists vary greatly.  Some group
members did not create any node lists, while others created more node lists
than tables of contents.  Table \ref{tab:A-Node List} shows the number of
node lists each member created.


\small
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Survey Questions about Node Lists. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Node Lists}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      I used the Unread Nodes:&5.6&2.8\\\hline
      I used the Nodes by type:&4.9&2.6\\\hline
      I used the Owned Nodes:&4.1&2.2\\\hline
      Unread Nodes is helpful helpful:&6.8&2.2\\\hline
      Nodes by type is helpful:&5.3&2.2\\\hline
      Owned Nodes is helpful:&5.1&2.2\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-Nodelist}
\end{table}
\normalsize


The survey results (see Table \ref{tab:survey-Nodelist}) reflect the wide
variety in the metrics data.  The users did not feel that they had used the
node lists as much as the table of contents (Avg. 5.6 vs. Avg. 8.7).  The
metrics data shows that some users created more node lists than TOCs.  The
standard deviations of the node list surveys show this large variation.
The users thought that the Unread Nodes list was almost as helpful as the
TOC (Avg. 6.8 vs. Avg. 8.3).



The last two features, Snoopy and Partyline were designed to promote
collaboration in AEN.  They are discussed next.

\subsubsection{Snoopy}

\small
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Survey Questions about Snoopy. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Snoopy}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      I used Snoopy:&6.3&2.6\\\hline
      Snoopy is helpful:&6.8&2.4\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-Snoopy}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The Snoopy feature is started with each AEN session.  To use the tool, the
user simply looks at a window that displays the usage information of all
users.  Thus there were no meaningful metrics collected about Snoopy.  The
survey results (see Table \ref{tab:survey-Snoopy}) show that the users
generally used and liked Snoopy.  The large standard deviation might be
attributed to the different user's method of collaboration.  Snoopy's
information is not very interesting if there are no other users logged in
or if the other members are present and accessible in the room.


The last feature evaluated in AEN is Partyline.
\subsubsection{Partyline} 

\footnotesize
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Partyline Messages.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|c||c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{9}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Partyline Messages}\\
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group A}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group B}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group C}\\ \hline
      Member&Msgs.&Sessions&Member&Msgs.&Sessions&Member&Msgs.&Sessions\\ \hline
      \hline
      A1&0&7&B1&0&9&C1&1&16\\\hline 
      A2&0&10&B2&47&36&C2&0&17\\ \hline
      A3&53&49&B3&154&40&C3&10&17\\ \hline
      A4&158&18&B4&0&18&C4&22&15\\ \hline
      A5&41&9&B5&0&17&C5&15&25\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:A-Partyline}
\end{table}
\normalsize


The metrics for Partyline use (see Table \ref{tab:A-Partyline}) show
that there is a wide variety in the number of Partyline messages sent.
Two users, A4 and B3, have 62.3\% of all the Partyline messages
sent.  Comparing the times Partyline messages were sent and when users
were simultaneously editing node, it does not appear that Partyline was
used more than 15 times to coordinate editing.

\small
\begin{table}
  \caption{Survey Questions about Partyline. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Partyline}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      I used Partyline:&5.2&2.6\\\hline
      Partyline is helpful helpful:&6.2&2.4\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-Partyline}
\end{table}
\normalsize

One possible reason for this low use of Partyline is referenced in the
limitations section of the experimental design.  The users could only
access AEN from two rooms.  This meant that they were frequently co-located
in the same room, and thus able to speak directly to each other instead of
using Partyline.  Since it is easier talk than type, I believe they
collaborated verbally instead of using Partyline.  This could lead to the
low score for Partyline use in the survey.  Table
\ref{tab:survey-Partyline} shows the results of the survey for Partyline.
The users felt that Partyline was fairly helpful even though the did not
use it very often.


\small
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Survey Question about Sense of Presence. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Sense of Presence}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      AEN provides a sense of:&6.5&1.9\\
      physical presence for&&\\
      the other users.&&\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-Presence}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The above two features are designed to promote a sense of physical presence
for each of the users.  The survey asked the users about their sense of
physical presence.  Table \ref{tab:survey-Presence} shows the results of
the sense of presence survey question.  They felt that AEN does provide a
sense of physical presence for the other users.

\subsection{Evaluation of AEN}
\label{sec:eval-AEN}

The evaluation of the set of features provided by AEN shows that they
generally were used and liked by the group members.  There was a wide
variation in the feelings of the group members and different features were
used to different degrees.  A goal of this research is to evaluate AEN as a
collaborative editing tool.

There are three different sets of evidence that lead me to believe AEN is a
successful collaborative tool. One, all three groups collaboratively
created quality requirements documents. Two groups received an A on their
document and one received a B.  Two, all three requirements documents show
high values in at least three of their collaborative metrics.  Three, the
survey results show that the users liked AEN.  Table \ref{tab:survey-AEN}
shows the results of the survey questions about AEN.

\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Survey Questions about AEN. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Overall reactions to AEN:}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      terrible---wonderful&5.5&1.6\\\hline
      frustrating---satisfying&5.0&1.8\\\hline
      dull---stimulating&5.0&1.7\\\hline
      difficult---easy&6.2&1.9\\\hline
      rigid---flexible&5.2&1.9\\\hline\hline
      AEN promotes collaboration:&7.2&2.0\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-AEN}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The users felt that AEN promoted collaboration, but there was disagreement
about that.  One user did not think AEN promoted collaboration.  That user
rated AEN a two out of nine.

AEN as a system supports collaboration, but what kinds of collaboration
occurred during the study?  The next section discusses some of the styles
each group displayed during the study.

\subsection{Three Examples of Strong Collaboration}
\label{sec:bottom-up}

Each of the three groups had their own collaborative style.  Two groups
defined their processes in their AEN workspace.  One group divided up the
work and used a style with lower EPN and RPN metrics.  A second group's
style has high EPN and RPN metrics.  The next three sections briefly
discusses each of the three group's collaborative styles.

\subsubsection{Group A}

Group A used the style with the lowest EPN and RPN metrics of the three groups.
They produced their own custom process model for collaboration.  One node
discusses this process and is reproduced here:

\begin{quote}
  {\em
  We need to develop some sort of an operating instruction to more
  effectively use AEN.  some difficulties that we have experienced so far
  have included:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item{Multiple users at one time - confusion exists, collaboration
    breaks down.}
  \item{Review of documents and updating - how and who}
  \item{Do we give write access to everyone in the group? then, who controls
    the node?}
  \end{enumerate}
    
  Suggestions to improve:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item{Every node created should be given write access by two individuals.
  The person who created the node and another.  Thus, there should be a
  primary author and a secondary author.}
  \item{Every member must be given read and annotate access!}
  \end{enumerate}}
\end{quote}

I believe this policy led to their low number of readers and authors per
node as compared to the other groups.  Their policy tends to be a divide
and conquer process.  Not allowing all five member write access
automatically reduces the number of authors.  This low number of authors
also explains why their FNC metric was so high.  Since each node only has
two authors, the other three members must use commenting to provide input
to the node.

Group A was not the only group with a defined process.  The other group
that defined a process in their workspace was Group B.

\subsubsection{Group B}

Group B created a node where they would put any comments to the other
members.  In this node they outlined their process for using AEN:
\begin{quote}
  {\em
  Please make nodes that you have created, not only readable, but also
  writable to other group members, at least annotation rights so that we
  comment on what you have done.  Due to the fact that we have a lot of
  work that should be done on AEN, I would like us to eventually put most
  of our questions, comments and work surrounding the project in AEN.
  }
\end{quote}

The instructions to make all nodes readable and writable to the other group
members leads to their high number of nodes with five editors.

\subsubsection{Group C}

The last group, C did not publish their process.  I believe that their lack
of a published process leads to their median results between Group A and
Group B with respect to EPN.  They did not have a process that restricted
the number of authors nor promoted having all five members author the
nodes.






\section{Recommendations}
\label{sec:conclusions}


Based upon the my experiences with AEN, I recommend the following to
encourage strong collaboration: provide direct and indirect authoring
mechanisms, provide access to intermediate work products, provide
context-sensitive ``what's new,'' and provide mechanisms to allow users as
well as documents to be visible.

My first recommendation is to provide direct and indirect authoring
mechanisms.  AEN supports two methods for collaborative authoring, which I
term {\em proof-reading}(indirect) and {\em trading the lock}(direct).  In
the proof-reading method, the author creates a node and publishes it by
allowing read and annotate access.  This allows others to make comments
suggesting changes, new ideas, or just general comments on the subject.
The author can read the comments and make changes to the document or
comment on the comments.  In the trading the lock method, the author
creates a node and allows other authors to edit it by providing read and
write access.  Each author can lock the node, make a change, save the node,
and unlock it, which updates the contents of the node displayed on each
author's screen.  Strong collaboration is enhanced by providing authors
with these degrees of control over the document and styles of interaction
with others.

My second recommendation is to provide access to intermediate work
products.  One of the strongest enablers of strong collaboration is easy
accessibility to intermediate work products.  Synergy is nurtured by
permission to review another's admittedly rough, first pass at an idea,
where comments and suggestions are aimed at refining and enhancing, rather
than confirming or denying, as is frequently the case with final, polished
presentations.

My third recommendation is to provide context-sensitive ``what's new.''
When a group divides into subgroups and is actively and incrementally
building hypertext documents, context-sensitive mechanisms to automatically
inform users of what has changed are essential. Otherwise, the users will
suffer from either lack of knowledge about what is changing (if no
change-related mechanisms exist) or a low signal-to-noise ratio (if
context-free change-related mechanisms are used, in which case users are
informed of many changes that are irrelevant to them.)  In AEN, the
combination of access control, unread nodes, and Hyperstar Bulletin
provides a very nice means of selectively propagating change-related
information across groups.  The daily Hyperstar Bulletin encourages users
to log in to AEN only when necessary to see changes, and access control
allows users to control the visibility of their changes.

My last recommendation is to provide a mechanism to allow users as well as
artifacts to be visible.  In AEN, providing knowledge of who was using AEN,
where they were, and a means to communicate with them created many new
opportunities for collaboration without requiring face-to-face interaction.

\section{Future Directions}
\label{sec:future}

In order to explore the issues associated with collaborative hypertext
document construction we developed the Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN). AEN
is a collaborative authoring tool built upon the Egret \cite{csdl-93-09}
collaborative system development environment.  Specifically, AEN
investigates and supports a form of collaboration termed {\em strong
collaboration}.  In strong collaboration, each participant contributes to
the construction of the document, and gains new knowledge as a direct
result of this construction.  The constructed document is not simply a
patchwork of individual contributions, but instead, an incremental,
emergent synthesis that reflects the knowledge created by the group as a
whole.  In general, strong collaboration most often (though not always)
occurs in non-computer mediated, face-to-face contexts such as a group
software design session or an interactive classroom setting.  A
distinguishing characteristic of strong collaboration is a sense of
collective authorship over most, if not all of the components of the
document.  To put it another way, strong collaboration is the antithesis of
'divide and conquer'.  Documents produced in this way should be of higher
quality, because more perspectives have combined to produce, review, and
correct errors in it.

\begin{figure}%[htb]
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=screen2.ps,width=3.25in}} 
  {\em This screen shot illustrates some of the support for strong
  collaboration in AEN.  The Snoopy window in the lower right hand corner
  shows, for each user of the system, whether or not they are logged in
  currently and if so, where they are working in the document.  Both user
  cmoore and user jeremyt are working on the document node called
  ``Shared Emacs''.  The Partyline screen, in the lower right hand
  corner, allows these users (as well as all others) to talk to each
  other while they work.  This figure also shows a local TOC for the
  Shared Emacs chapter, and a screen displaying the current set of unread
  document nodes for this user.}
 \caption{Screen Shot of AEN.}
 \label{fig:Screen2}
\end{figure}

The basic premise behind AEN is that strong collaboration can be
enabled and encouraged through computer mediation.  The process of strong
collaboration can be supported by tools that assist the group in their
collaborative process.  Figure \ref{fig:Screen2} shows some of AEN's tools
that support strong collaboration.

AEN provides several generic tools to assist the group in their
collaborative authoring process: typed nodes and links; a simple yet
powerfull access control model for each node; context sensitive tables of
contents; context sensitive node lists; and two tools to support a sense of
``Physical'' presence in the hypertext document.

Typed nodes and links allows groups to define their own hypertext
structure.  

The access control model allows the authors of a node to decide who is able
to read, comment on and modify that node.  This access control model allows
the group to define their own process of review and revision for the
document.

The tables of contents allow the individual authors to focus on only the
portions of the hypertext document that they are interested in and are able
to view.  The tables of contents also show users what nodes have changed
since the last time they viewed them.  Node lists also provide a rapid way
of accessing nodes that have changed.

The two tools that provide a ``Physical'' presence in the hypertext
document help promote interaction among the users.  The Snoopy tool allows
users to see what other users are doing.  The Partyline tool allows users
to chat with each other.
