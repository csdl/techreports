\section*{Broader Impacts}
\label{sec:merit}

% {\em The Project Description must contain, as a separate section within the narrative, a discussion of the broader impacts of the proposed activities. Broader impacts may be accomplished through the research itself, through the activities that are directly related to specific research projects, or through activities that are supported by, but are complementary to the project. NSF values the advancement of scientific knowledge and activities that contribute to the achievement of societally relevant outcomes. Such outcomes include, but are not limited to: full participation of women, persons with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); improved STEM education and educator development at any level; increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology; improved well-being of individuals in society; development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce; increased partnerships between academia, industry, and others; improved national security; increased economic competitiveness of the United States; and enhanced infrastructure for research and education.

A report to the U.S. Department of Energy in September 2009 on the
Principle Characteristics of the Smart Grid echoes our research orientation
when it states: {\em ``Achieving consumer participation means
  making participation easy and understandable.  And essential to this will
  be providing a user interface that successfully motivates and supports
  consumer action. [...] Today's communications and electronic technologies
  create options that were just not viable in the past.''}
\cite{NETL:EnablesActiveParticipation}

We believe our research proposal defines an ambitious, aggressive, yet
feasible approach to obtaining significant insight into an important
societal question: What kinds of information, provided in what ways and at
what times, enables consumers to make positive, sustained changes to their
energy consumption behaviors?  We will gain new insights into this question
in a number of ways.  First, we will develop open source, component-based
infrastructure called WattBlocks that will lower the technological barriers
to scientific research on energy and human behavior.  Second, we will
develop a novel social networking technology called eSpheres that supports
a variety of motivating factors for behavioral change.  Third, we will
conduct six case studies, in both dormitory and residential settings, that
will provide new forms of empirical data on energy behaviors and how they
change (or don't change) given various motivating factors.

To achieve these goals, we will build upon our prior experiences with open
source software development and empirical software engineering research. We
will also build upon established relationships with University of Hawaii
organizations (REIS, Sustainable UH) and community organizations (Kanu
Hawaii, Blue Planet Foundation, Hawaiian Electric Company).  Hawaii
is an EPSCOR state and approximately 84\% of University of Hawaii
undergraduates are minorities, so this research will benefit
under-represented populations. 

This research creates a replicable mechanism for assessing and improving
energy knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of university students and
residential community members. We expect the outcome will not only be
immediate energy conservation with all of the attending positive benefits,
but also an empowering of these individuals who have gained first-hand
knowledge that their actions can make a difference, and the ways that they
can engage with their communities and at many different scales of
interaction.  It will create publicly available, open source technology
useful not only for research but for education as well.  For example, we
have used WattDepot in software engineering class projects in Fall of 2009.

Our research provides an evidence-driven approach to understanding what
kinds of information should be provided by the Smart Grid to its users in
order to effect sustained, positive changes in behavior.  For the purposes
of this research, energy data will be gathered through installation of
third-party metering systems and analyzed through WattBlocks services. In
the long run, we hope the insights from this research will migrate into the Smart
Grid infrastructure itself, using standard utility meters to collect data
which is then distributed to information services (either inside or outside
of the utility industry) for analysis, interpretation, and presentation.
