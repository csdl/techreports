\section{Goals}

We are designing the UH Dorm Energy Competition Project (Kukui
Cup\footnote{We named the competition Kukui Cup because kukui nut oil was used by ancient Hawaiians as a source of light,
  thus serving as the earliest form of ``electricity'' in the islands.}) to achieve three goals:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Improve the {\em energy literacy} of the participating students;
\item Conduct {\em innovative, cutting edge research} in information technology for
  energy-related behavioral change;
\item {\em Save money} for the university by reducing energy costs.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Improve energy literacy}

Energy literacy \cite{DeWaters09b, DeWaters09} has three components:
knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Energy knowledge refers to factual 
information and skills, such as the ability to estimate the energy savings
in Watt-hours from switching lights from incandescent to compact
flourescent.   Energy attitudes refers to one's opinions and beliefs
related to energy, such as the feeling that conserving energy is good for
the environment.   Energy behaviors combine knowledge and attitudes to
produce concrete action, such as replacing the incandescent bulbs in one's
home with compact flourescent. 

While one might assume from the above definition that energy literate
behaviors follow naturally from knowledge and attitudes, there is
substantial research to the contrary.  For example, Geller \cite{Geller81}
performed an experiment in which 40 consumers attended a three hour
workshop on energy conservation.  A pre and post workshop questionnaire
determined that all participants gained greater awareness of energy issues,
more appreciation for what could be done in their homes to reduce energy
use and save money, and a willingness to implement the changes that were
advocated in the workshop. However, a one month followup indicated very
little actual change in behavior. One person lowered the temperature on the
hot water heater. Two additional people had installed insulating blankets
around their hot water heaters, but they had already done this before the
workshop. Finally, eight people installed low-flow shower heads---after all
40 participants had been given the low-flow shower heads at the workshop.

As this and similar research illustrates, simply providing people with
information about energy, even if it affects their attitudes, is generally
not enough to create sustained, positive behavioral change with respect to
their energy usage.  Fortunately, there is also a growing body of research
on techniques that do support behavioral change
\cite{Becker78,Darby06,Faruqui09,Houwelingen89,Peterson07,Peterson07a,Staats04,Vollink99},
which can be summarized as follows.  First, provide {\em personalized
  information} that reflects the consumer's unique circumstances.  For
example, a dorm resident will not respond well to energy tips involving
improved insulation.  Second, provide both {\em general and specific
  commitments}, especially when they can be tied to a broader issue. For
example, pledging to use a clothesline rather than a dryer because it
reduces green house gas emissions.  Third, provide {\em achievable goals}
that can be objectively measured.  An example might be to reduce energy
consumption by 10\% over the previous month.  Fourth, elicit {\em social
  reinforcement} which can be manifested in both overt and subtle ways.
For example, in dorm settings, as more and more residents publicly
participate, it implicitly becomes ``the thing to do''.  Fifth, provide
{\em constant and contextual feedback} which helps verify progress toward
goals and can reinvigorate commitments, as long as the feedback is provided
in the right way at the right time.  Sixth, {\em financial incentives} can
be a powerful motivator for energy conservation. For example, a prize such
as iPods to the members of the dorm floor who conserved the most energy.

Thus, the first design goal of the dorm energy competition is to increase
factual knowledge about energy by participants, foster more sophisticated
attitudes based upon this knowledge, and, most finally, facilitate actual
behavioral change.


\subsection{Conduct innovative IT energy research}

As noted in the previous section, there is evidence in support of a variety
of techniques for promoting sustained, positive behavioral change, but
current dorm energy competitions either do not employ these techniques, or
they do not utilize information technology effectively to deploy the
techniques or support assessment of their effectiveness.

The most common form of information technology support for dorm energy
competitions is a simple relatively static web site, as illustrated in
Figure \ref{fig:wellesley}.  These websites provide access to resources
about energy, and feedback regarding energy usage for the entire building
every few days.  The most sophisticated technology to date is the Campus
Resource Monitoring System at Oberlin College, which has the potential to
provide near-real time energy consumption data\footnote{With respect to
  energy consumption data, we define ``near-real time'' as sub-minute
  update intervals.  For example, obtaining meter data every 10 seconds is
  ``near real time'', while obtaining meter data every 15 minutes is not.}.

\end{figure*} 


We are designing a collection of software services that will provide UH
dorm residents participating in the competition with unparalleled
information technology support for improving their energy literacy.  Our
software will support a unique combination of features including: (a)
near-real time energy consumption data, (b) floor-level as well as
building-level energy data; (c) personalized, login-protected pages for
each student; (d) energy literacy activities with a ``Kukui Nut'' award
system for participation; and (e) integration with other information
technologies used by students, including text messaging, Facebook, email,
and Twitter.

Our software services are not designed merely to be cool or trendy; they
are designed to enable substantial, important research into energy
behavior. While prior research has generated evidence regarding a variety
of techniques for fostering behavioral change, there is relatively little
understanding of the relative importance or impact of these methods.  Our
software will enable us to present students with a variety of avenues for
participation and determine the ways in which they took part. It will also
enable us to observe and record their energy usage (on a floor-by-floor
basis) before, during, and after the competition.  In addition, we will
request student volunteers for an energy literacy assessment both before
and after the competition.  The result of these three streams of data will
provide a uniquely rich source of insight into the popularity of various
activities, their impact on energy literacy, and the final impact on actual
energy usage.  

\subsection{Save money}

Challenges at Brandeis University, Carleton College, Harvard University,
MIT, Mount Holyoke College, Ohio University, and Williams College have
reported energy savings, generally in the range of 7\% to 16\%.
