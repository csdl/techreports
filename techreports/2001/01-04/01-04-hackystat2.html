<h2 align="left">Problems with Hackystat1 and proposals for addressing them
under Hackystat2</h2>

<p align="left">The original hackystat design (let's call it Hackystat1) has served us well, but as
the system has increased in size, complexity, and functionality, several
shortcomings have become apparent. This first section lists both major and minor
problems and proposes how they will be addressed in the new design called
Hackystat2.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Which code executes on the client side, which code
    executes on the server side, and which code executes on both sides?</b><i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<br>
    The current package structure does not clarify where code executes.&nbsp;
    This makes learning the system much more difficult, since you don't know
    which code you can safely ignore for a given task. To fix this, we could
    restructure the code into three top level packages, hackystat.server,
    hackystat.client, and hackystat.common.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Common functionality can be extracted from the Log and
    Notification classes.</b><br>
    The ActivityLog, SessionLog, JUnitTestLog, and BadDataLog share the same
    constructor, class variables, methods, and so forth.&nbsp; To fix this, we
    can provide an abstract BaseLog class that each of these classes extends and
    which implements the common functionality. A similar refactoring can be
    performed on the Notification classes similar effects.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Unintuitive class and package names.</b><br>
    Some names could be better.&nbsp;&nbsp; hackystat.kernel might be better
    named as hackystat.util. hackystat.cache should be hackystat.repository.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>Vestigial packages.</b><br>
    The hackystat.test package should simply go away entirely, since we have
    long adopted the idea of keeping tests in the packages that they operate
    on.&nbsp; The TestHello class is not needed any more.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Log
    design</b><br>
    The concept of &quot;Log&quot; and its interfaces seems to conflate together
    three separate abstractions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first abstraction is a persistent store of entries, and the
    Log and LogEntry interfaces are designed to work with the underlying FileCache
    mechanism to support this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second abstraction is the isInteresting() method. This method is
    intended to indicate whether or not something anomalous exists in the log
    instance that should be brought to the attention of the user.&nbsp; However,
    some persistent stores (such as the index.xml page) are never interesting.
    It's also possible (at least in the future) that something that is not
    persistent might want to have the interesting property attached to it.&nbsp;
    The third abstraction relates to logs being repositories for notification
    data.&nbsp; The way this gets messy is in the design of the userindex page:
    I am replicating code from FileCache because I don't treat the userindex.xml
    like a &quot;normal&quot; log page.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    On another level, it's become apparent that the UserPage data object and the
    various *Log data objects are in some sense two views onto the same
    thing.&nbsp; The idea is that UserPages provides a representation of the
    data files that exist for a given user, and they are constructed upon system
    startup (more or less) by actually traversing the file structure.&nbsp; This is important, because it
    means we don't have to basically test every single possible file for
    existence in order to build up a representation of the files associated with
    a user.&nbsp; *Log data objects, on the other hand, are created &quot;on
    demand&quot;.&nbsp; The current design problem is that we don't have a good way to map between a
    given UserPage and the corresponding *Log instance and vice-versa.&nbsp; &nbsp;
    What we need is a LogType class which is an
    enumerated type of all possible log files.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    To deal with these issues, we need a richer hierarchy of dataset objects than just
    &quot;log&quot;.&nbsp; There are the following:
    <ul>
      <li>SensorLog: represents data collected from sensors. Maybe should be
        named &quot;SensorLog&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Always a notification
        associated with these data sets. All current SensorLogs are kept in one
        file per day (or will be once I fix the SessionLog).&nbsp; I think that
        we should simply declare that all SensorLogs are kept in daily files for
        simplicity's sake.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>AnalysisLog: represents data that is derived from SensorLogs or from
        other AnalysisLogs. Unlike SensorLogs, which should be daily, AnalysisLogs
        could represent a daily, monthly, yearly,
        or some other time frame (such as the duration of a single project).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Log:&nbsp; represents the union of SensorLogs and AnalysisLogs. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>One common feature of all of the above logs is that they hold data that is unique to a
    <i>single</i> user.&nbsp; The UserInfoLog, on the other hand, holds data about
    the set of pages available over <i>all</i> users. To fix this inconsistency,
    we can split up the current UserInfoLog which is now a singleton into a
    class which creates a separate instance for each
    user. We'll call it UserIndex.&nbsp;&nbsp; This has the following implications:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>UserIndex will be a kind of Analysis log that holds a set of LogInfo instances.
        (LogInfo is a generalized version of UserPage.) There
        is one LogInfo instance for each Log object associated with the
        user.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Just like we do now, the set of LogInfo instances associated with
        each UserIndex will be (lazily) rebuilt for each user each time the
        server is restarted. This allows the administrator to manually insert
        and remove files from the user's directory, then restart the server and
        have the system update itself automatically.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Unlike now, each LogInfo will store whether or not its page is
        &quot;interesting&quot;. This means that we won't have to recompute
        &quot;interestingness&quot; every night over every file, which we're
        currently doing and which is needless.&nbsp; It also means that as we
        get more sophisticated with our definition of &quot;interesting&quot;,
        we can simply restart the server to have &quot;interestingness&quot;
        recomputed over all of the data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Operations on the UserIndex can tell you if a Log of a particular
        type exists for a given day, and whether or not it is interesting.
        Another can retrieve and return the Log instance for you. A free( )
        operation could remove the instance from memory.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The UserIndex should replace the UserInfoBean
        class.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>The constructor could accept either email addresses or directory key
        values, making it unnecessary for the user to have to manually map
        between them.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we go this way, then we still have the problem of how to associate
    email addresses with property keys.&nbsp; This is now a simple problem that
    we can solve via a Properties file that associates these things together and
    does not need fileCache or anything. &nbsp; It could be called DirectoryKeys or something
    similar and store the file in &lt;tomcat&gt;/admin/hackystat/.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Log and Analysis object relationships</b><br>
    In the current version of the system, the relationship between
    &quot;Log&quot; instances (i.e. representations of the raw data from the
    sensors) and &quot;Analysis&quot; instances (i.e. representations of derived
    values) is very simplistic. In general, each time new raw data arrives, the
    sensor log is updated, and all analyses that depends upon that sensor log
    are re-computed from scratch regardless of whether their results are
    affected or not.&nbsp; Furthermore, analyses are currently
    designed as more-or-less &quot;top-level&quot; functions: they do not assume
    their results will be required by some other higher level analysis.&nbsp;
    Although almost all analyses run immediately when new sensor data
    appears,&nbsp; there is a single exception: the &quot;Daily Email&quot;,
    which runs once a day.&nbsp; This approach suffers from several problems:
    (1) a large amount of recomputation can occur when receiving a single raw
    data update; (2) analyses cannot leverage each other's results; and (3) an
    analysis may potentially have to read in all of the old sensor data in order
    to compute a result. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    In the new version of the system, we should create a more efficient and
    logical relationship between Log and Analysis objects that enables the
    system to scale, and more importantly, facilitates the ability of one
    analysis to leverage the results from another analysis, rather than having
    to always go back to the raw sensor data.&nbsp; Here is the proposed new
    approach:<br>
    <ul>
    <li> 
    SensorLog instances (which simply store the raw data received directly by
    sensors) are updated and saved out immediately as the data is
    received.
    <li> 
    AnalysisLog instances are computed or updated at least once a day, and this
    computation is based upon a timer-based process.&nbsp; Each analysis
    instance should check the lastUpdate field of the objects it depends upon
    (which could be SensorLog or AnalysisLog instances).&nbsp; If the lastUpdate
    field is within the last 24 hours, then it needs to recompute itself and
    update its own lastUpdate field. Otherwise, it doesn't have to do
    anything.&nbsp;
    <li> 
    Every AnalysisLog instance should be designed under the assumption that some
    other AnalysisLog instance will be designed in the future that will want
    access to the first AnalysisLog's data in an efficient manner.&nbsp; This
    means each AnalysisLog instance should expose an interface with useful
    methods regarding its computation. When one of these methods are invoked,
    the AnalysisLog must first determine if its internal state is up to date by
    checking the lastUpdate field of the instances that it uses to compute its
    values.&nbsp; If it needs to recompute itself before returning a value, then
    it does so.&nbsp;
    <li> 
    If one AnalysisLog can depend upon an arbitrary number of other AnalysisLogs,
    then we have a classic dependency analysis situation. To start, we should
    simply require the developer to make explicit the dependencies, and we will
    have to manually decide on the order in which AnalysisLogs are updated in
    order to ensure that the state is recomputed from the bottom up.&nbsp; We
    will also have to ensure that circular dependencies are not present.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>Persistency of AnalysisLog data (i.e. the lack thereof)</b><br>
    My experience with Hackystat1 has revealed further differences between
    SensorLogs and AnalysisLogs with respect to persistency. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    We have a standardized mechanism for persistency of SensorLog instances
    based upon the FileCache mechanism. This means that raw data is always
    persistent and can be (relatively) easily stored and retrieved from disk.
    Furthermore, the use of XSL stylesheets means that SensorLog data can be
    (relatively) easily displayed to the user. SensorLog data is static,
    tabular, and textual in nature, which makes the XSL stylesheet mechanism of
    display quite reasonable.&nbsp; SensorLog data is
    &quot;dependency-free&quot;, in that the contents of a SensorLog is not
    affected by changes to any other SensorLog or AnalysisLog: the only way a
    SensorLog is affected is by receipt of raw data of the type stored by the
    SensorLog on the day represented by that SensorLog.&nbsp; We must persist
    SensorLog data because we cannot derive it from other stored data; if it is
    not stored on disk, then it is lost forever as soon as the server shuts
    down.&nbsp; Finally, representation of any SensorLog evolves relatively
    slowly (indeed, there has been almost no evolution in SensorLog data
    representation so far.)<br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    AnalysisLog data has different characteristics. First, AnalysisLog data is
    not necessarily static, tabular, or textual in nature, making XSL
    stylesheets less appealing.&nbsp; More importantly, AnalysisLog data is not
    dependency-free: a change to the value of one AnalysisLog may impact upon
    the values of an arbitrary number of other AnalysisLogs.&nbsp; Unlike
    SensorLogs, AnalysisLogs by definition can always be recomputed by
    retrieving their underlying SensorLog or AnalysisLog instances (the latter
    of which may require its own recomputation.) Finally, AnalysisLog
    representations are certain to evolve frequently and unpredictably as we
    invent new and better ways to analyze the data. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    My proposal for Hackystat2 is the following:&nbsp; AnalysisLog instances are
    <i>never</i> persistent, and AnalysisLog instances are <i>always</i>
    displayed to the user by way of an associated JSP page (which provides an
    HTML representation of the underlying AnalysisLog instance).&nbsp; Each
    AnalysisLog instance obeys the JavaBean naming conventions so that it can be
    passed into the JSP page and its state extracted for display. Because all
    AnalysisLog method invocations have the effect of bringing the instance up
    to date if necessary, the user can always get the most recent values for an
    AnalysisLog by retrieving the associated JSP page. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    My proposal has a big strength and a big weakness.&nbsp; Its big strength is
    flexibility and support for evolution.&nbsp; Because AnalysisLog instances
    are not persistent, evolution in their representation is easier for two
    reasons: (a) we do not have to design, implement, evolve, and update a
    persistent representation for AnalysisLog instances, and (b) once we have
    installed updates to an AnalysisLog, all we have to do to see the changes is
    restart the server.&nbsp; Since AnalysisLog values are recomputed from
    scratch each time the server restarts, that means we will automatically have
    the updated analysis results not only over SensorData received in the
    future, but also for all the SensorData in the past.&nbsp; In other words,
    we get &quot;retroactive&quot; updates to our analysis mechanisms.&nbsp;
    Because we don't save the representation, we don't have to go through the
    old AnalysisLog files and delete them or modify them to keep them up to date
    as the analyses evolve. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    The big weakness is that each time we restart the server, we will
    potentially need to re-read all of the sensor data for all users to rebuild
    the entire analysis hierarchy of instances from scratch.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the
    time being, I think this is very acceptable price to pay. In the future,
    when usage of the system gets high enough that this becomes a problem, I
    predict that at least some AnalysisLog instances will have stabilized, and
    at that point we could make them persistent if we believe this will improve
    performance.&nbsp; On the other hand, we might find that if we rebuild the
    AnalysisLog hierarchy only on demand, and if we have a robust method for GC-ing
    old SensorLog instances right after reading them in, then it might never
    become a problem.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    Basically, right now the trade-off is between speed of design and speed of
    execution, and since speed of design is an actual problem and speed of
    execution is a potential problem, we should favor decisions that increase
    speed of design.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><p><b>The return of index.xml as index.jsp.</b><br>
    Early on, we created an index.xml file for each user that listed every XML
    file in their repository.&nbsp; As the number of daily log files has grown
    to over a half dozen, the resulting linear listing of the literally hundreds of files
    associated with each user is unusable.<br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    Our next approach was to eliminate index.xml in favor of a daily
    calendar-based view.&nbsp; This approach provides an elegant and usable
    interface to <i>daily</i> data. However, it is currently being used as the
    &quot;universal&quot; interface to <i>all</i> hackystat data, which is
    starting to cause its own set of problems. First, although all SensorLogs
    are daily in nature, AnalysisLogs could be daily, weekly, monthly, yearly,
    or project-based in timeframe. The daily calendar-based interface
    degenerates into a linear listing for all non-daily data.&nbsp; Second, as
    the number of daily analyses grows, listing them within a single calendar
    could create a potentially unusable interface. Imagine a calendar with 20 or
    30 SensorLog and AnalysisLog buttons associated with each day. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    I propose the following solution: return to a home page for each user called
    index.jsp, but instead of listing every file, that page will contain a set of
    links to calendar-based pages, which themselves contain links to the
    individual XML files (in the case of SensorLogs) or JSP pages (in the case
    of AnalysisLogs).&nbsp; The number of entries in such an index.jsp page
    would grow relatively slowly.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    Here is a sample list of the entries in the new index.jsp file to give you
    an idea of what I'm proposing:
    <ul>
    <li> Daily Sensor Data (a calendar view of all SensorLog entries)
    <li> Daily Analysis Data (a calendar view of all AnalysisLog entries that
      are daily in nature)
    <li> Monthly Analysis Data (a monthly calendar view of AnalysisLogs that are
      monthly in nature).
    <li> Environment Configuration (a JSP page containing a form that allows the
      user to set configuration variables such as their idle time interval and
      module configuration data)&nbsp;
    </ul>
    <p>Note that this page would not provide you with direct feedback on
    &quot;interestingness&quot;; instead, the user will need to rely on the
    Daily Email (or some other mechanism) to help guide them to the appropriate
    places.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Standardized identification and retrieval of Log files.</b><br>
    It will simplify life a great deal if we standardize the way we identify all
    Log files---i.e. both SensorLogs and AnalysisLogs.&nbsp; This is because the
    new design could then provide uniform access to all of the log files through
    the UserIndex instance.&nbsp; For example, the simplest solution is a single
    getLog() method that takes a standard set of arguments that suffice to
    uniquely identify every SensorLog and AnalysisLog instance .&nbsp; To make
    this work, I propose that any Log object can be uniquely identified based
    upon three attributes:
    <ol>
    <li> LogType
    <li> UserEmail or DirectoryKey string
    <li> Date (either YY, YY-MM, YY-MM-DD, YY-MM-DD-HH:MM:SS, etc.)
    </ol>
    <p>
    This has the following implications:
    <ul>
    <li>
    The LogType enumerated type must enumerate all defined SensorLogs and AnalysisLogs.
    <li>
    The UserEmail and DirectoryKey values are simply two strings that are
    aliases of each other. Therefore, you should be able to pass either
    one.&nbsp; It is simple to guarantee that no directorykey contains the
    &quot;@&quot; character and that all email addresses contain the
    &quot;@&quot; character, which means we can always determine whether a given
    string is a UserEmail or a DirectoryKey.
    <li>
    For any given LogType and User, a Date must be sufficient to distinguish all of
    the log instances from each other.&nbsp; This is trivially true for
    SensorLogs, which are all daily logs by definition.&nbsp; It is not clear
    that this will work as well for all possible AnalysisLogs, although I can't
    think of a stunning counter-example at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to
    proceed on the assumption that all AnalysisLog objects can be assigned to a
    unique Date value for retrieval purposes. Note that since no AnalysisLog
    object is persistent, we don't have to write out files for them.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;
    </ul>
    <li><b>Where is the isInteresting property computed and cached, and why?<br>
      </b>As noted previously and below, every SensorLog and AnalysisLog object
      has a boolean &quot;Interestingness&quot; property associated with it
      which is computed by a method associated with the Log called isInteresting().&nbsp;
      Obviously, in order for a SensorLog or AnalysisLog to compute the
      property, it needs access to its internal state information.&nbsp; The
      isInteresting property is particularly problematic in the case of
      SensorLogs because we would like to be able to garbage collect sensor log
      instances while still having access to the Interestingness value
      associated with these instances. Currently, we can't do that, and it
      results in us reading in every single SensorLog file&nbsp; in order to
      compute the interestingness property so that we can display the calendar
      page.&nbsp; This is clearly a bad thing.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
      So that we can garbage collect SensorLog instances while still retaining
      some important information about them, the LogInfo class allows us to
      cache values about logs.&nbsp; The isInteresting property is one such
      value. Their lastUpdate timestamp is another. Along the same lines, the
      LogInfo class can enable us to compute the URL associated with retrieval
      and display of a Log instance without actually having to create the
      instance itself. In some sense, the LogInfo class is like a wrapper around
      the actual Log class.&nbsp;<br>
</ol>
<h2>Package-level structure under Hackystat2
    </h2>
<p>To help kick-start this redesign, the following table presents a revised
package structure for Hackystat2.&nbsp; All of these packages are&nbsp; within
the top-level &quot;hackystat&quot; package.&nbsp;
    </p>
<p>As usual, lower case names indicate packages, while capitalized names
indicate classes. All JUnit test files are omitted for readability.
    </p>
<p>This table is a little hard to read, but basically each blank cell
&quot;inherits&quot; the value above it if any.&nbsp; Here are some example
fully qualified classes to give you an idea of how things work:
    </p>
<ul>
  <li>hackystat.server.admin.DirectoryKey</li>
  <li>hackystat.server.util.ServerProperties</li>
  <li>hackystat.server.log.Log</li>
  <li>hackystat.server.log.sensor.BaseLog</li>
  <li>hackystat.server.log.sensor.activity.ActivityLog</li>
  <li>hackystat.client.sensor.jbuilder.JBuilderSessionSensor</li>
  <li>hackystat.common.util.DateInfo</li>
