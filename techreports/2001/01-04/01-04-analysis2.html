<h3 align="left">Overview</h3>
<p align="left">Hackystat 2 does a better job of defining the boundaries between
sensor log data and analysis data.&nbsp; Sensor log data is always stored into
daily log files and represents direct data from the user's tools.&nbsp; In a
real sense, sensor data is &quot;objective&quot; data.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">Analysis data, on the other hand, is derived from sensor data
(and/or from other analysis data).&nbsp; It is not persistent and not stored in
files, but is rebuilt each time the server restarts. (This is a feature rather
than a bug, at least at this point, because it simplifies changes and upgrades
to our analysis mechanisms.)&nbsp; Analysis data, in a real sense, is
&quot;subjective&quot; data---all analyses are an interpretation and/or
abstraction of the objective sensor log data.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">From prior experience, we know the following things to be true:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">It is easy to collect an overwhelming amount of sensor data.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Raw sensor data is difficult to understand.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Most data that's collected is not very interesting to a
    programmer.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Programmers quickly habituate to regular notifications when
    they do not contain novel or useful information. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Programmers are interrupt-driven, they do not
    &quot;poll&quot;.&nbsp; You cannot expect them to regularly consult a web
    site or periodically perform a set of analyses just poking around for things
    of interest.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">What may appear at first glance to be an event of interest
    may not be.&nbsp; Even if it is, the appropriate action may require a more
    detailed understanding of the things that led up to the discovery of the
    event of interest..&nbsp; </li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Our goal in hackystat is to build up a library of analyses that
are automatically and regularly performed on sensor data and/or other analysis
data for each user.&nbsp; When the analyses discover something of interest, we
send an email to the user noting that something of interest has occurred and
providing them with a way of investigating further. </p>
<h3 align="left">Analysis, displays, and alerts </h3>
<p align="left">As an initial foray into the design of this representational
thicket,&nbsp; I propose that we start by defining three concepts and their
interrelationships: analyses, displays, and alerts. </p>
<p align="left">An <i>analysis</i>  is a class that provides some interpretation of the user's
behavior. An example analysis object might provide the active time spent by a
specific user on a specific day by analysis of the activity sensor log.&nbsp;
Another one might represent the variation in unit test coverage on a specific
project over the course of a month.&nbsp; This latter analysis might consolidate
the results from a month's worth of daily jblanket sensor logs..</p>
<p align="left">A <i>display</i> is a combination of a JSP page and its associated MVC
Command class.&nbsp; Every analysis has at least one
corresponding display.&nbsp; (Some displays may be associated with multiple
analyses. For example, the DailyDiary&nbsp; might serve as the display for
several kinds of analyses.)&nbsp; The fact that all analyses must have at least
one associated display creates visibility:&nbsp; the conclusions of
any analysis instance can be seen by the user. </p>
<p align="left">An <i>alert</i> is a class that functions as a predicate on one
or more analysis objects.&nbsp; An alert returns true if the analysis object is
&quot;interesting&quot; or &quot;anomalous&quot; in some sense and thus demands
attention from the user.&nbsp; In general, Hackystat will apply the set of all
alerts to their associated analysis objects each night.&nbsp; For each alert
that returns true, Hackystat will include information about that alert in the
email message to the user for the next day.&nbsp; Along with that alert
information will be an URL providing access to the display corresponding to the
analysis object that this alert was invoked on.&nbsp; For example, one kind of
alert might implement the following predicate: &quot;The user should have at
least 90 minutes of active time each day&quot;.&nbsp; If that alert is
triggered, then the user would be sent an email that says that they did not work
90 minutes in the previous day and include a pointer to the DailyDiary page that
demonstrates that less than 90 minutes was worked.&nbsp; Another alert might be: &quot;The user should
have active time at least 4 times in the past 7 days&quot;.&nbsp; If that alert
is triggered, then the user would be sent an email that says that they did not
work 4 times in the past seven days and include a pointer to a WeeklyDiary page
that explains that alert finding. </p>
<p align="left">So there you have the basic cycle. A user works, which generates
sensor log data.&nbsp; This sensor log data is analyzed in various ways.&nbsp; The
analyses are operated on by a variety of alerts.&nbsp; When an alert is
triggered, the user gets notified.&nbsp; This notification leads to the user
inspecting the associated data, and hopefully making some change in their
behavior as a result. The users subsequent behavior generates more
sensor log data, and the cycle continues. </p>
<p align="left">You can see opportunities here for adaptation.&nbsp; For
example, instead of saying &quot;You need to work 90 minutes a day&quot;, it
might be more useful to accumulate an average working day over a period of time,
and then notify the user when their daily active time departs from their normal
average for more than 2 or 3 days in a row. For one user, perhaps 90 minutes a
day is the right &quot;trigger&quot;. For another, it might be 400, and it might
vary from one month to the next.&nbsp; In fact, getting this kind of behavior in
which the system determines on a user-by-user basis what &quot;normal&quot;
might be and then tells them when they appear to be acting
&quot;abnormally&quot; is exactly the goal of statistical process control
techniques.&nbsp; </p>
<h3 align="left">General analysis design criteria</h3>
<p align="left">Some of the general design criteria for analysis objects
include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Every analysis class implements the
    hackystat.server.analysis.Analysis interface. (In addition, daily analyses
    extend the hackystat.server.analysis.daily.DailyAnalysis class,&nbsp;
    which&nbsp; provides caching services, as discussed further below.) <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Analysis constructors always require a directory key
    identifying the user whose data is going to be analyzed.&nbsp; Most analysis
    constructors will also require a second argument: a date indicating the day
    of data on which the analysis should be performed.&nbsp; The additional arguments if any depend upon the
    analysis being performed.&nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Analysis classes are divided into a set of subpackages. One
    set of subpackages divides up those analyses that interpret data for a
    specific interval of a day, week, month, or year.&nbsp; These packages are
    hackystat.server.analysis.daily, hackystat.server.analysis.weekly,
    hackystat.server.analysis.monthly, and hackystat.server.analysis.yearly.
    Other subpackages might be created based upon different distinguishing
    properties, such as the system under development (hackystat.server.analysis.system)..<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
</ul>
<h3 align="left">Daily analysis design criteria</h3>
<p align="left">The daily analysis objects live in the
hackystat.server.analysis.daily package.&nbsp; Daily analysis objects observe
the following design property: they represent a day as a 288 element array of
objects called the DayArray.&nbsp; This divides the day into five minute
intervals as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">DayArray[0] represents all information regarding the time
    period from 00:00:00 to 00:04:59.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">DayArray[1] represents all information regarding the time
    period from 00:05:00 to 00:09:59.</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">Thus, every multiple of 12 starts a new hour (DayArray[12]
represents the five minute interval starting at 1:00am, DayArray[24] = 2:00am,
etc.)</p>
<p align="left">The DayArray is intended to simplify our initial analyses by
providing an abstracted representation of time and time intervals. Every event,
once placed into its proper DayArray element location, is no longer analyzed
with respect to its specific time of occurrence within that five minute
interval.&nbsp; Instead, it just occurred at DayArray time N, where N is a
number between 0 and 287.&nbsp; (Of course, we still have the sensor logs with
exact time data, so we can always construct a different analysis mechanism later
with exact times if we realize we need to.) </p>
<p align="left">Here are some examples of analysis using DayArrays.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>EventData. </b> The EventData creates a DayArray
    in which each cell contains a list of the ActivityEntry instances that
    occurred during that five minute time period. <br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left"><b>ActiveTime. </b> The ActiveTime analysis creates a
    DayArray in which each
    DayArray cell has one of three values: ACTIVE, IDLE, INACTIVE.&nbsp; To compute
    this, the ActiveTime analysis needs to use two constants:&nbsp; the
    IdleTimeThreshold and the InactiveThreshold.&nbsp; Both of these are set in
    the user's configuration page.&nbsp; IdleTimeThreshold is one of the
    integers 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, with a default value of 15.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
    InactiveThreshold is one of the integers 30, 60, 90, 120, with a default
    value of 30. <br>
    &nbsp; <br>
    Assuming default values for IdleTimeThreshold and InactiveThreshold, then we
    can compute the active, idle, and inactive time for the day according to the
    following algorithm..&nbsp;&nbsp; Obtain the EventData
    analysis object.&nbsp; Iterate through each of the DayArray cells in the
    EventData analysis object starting at cell 0.&nbsp; 
    <ul>
    <li> If the corresponding EventData cell is empty, and if the preceding 2
      cells (or less if we are in the first five cells) are also empty, then set
      this cell and the preceding two cells to IDLE..
    <li> If the corresponding EventData cell is empty, and if the preceding 5
      cells (or less if we are in the first five cells) are also empty, then set
      this cell and the preceding five cells to INACTIVE.
    <li> If the corresponding EventData cell has ActivityEntries, then set the
      ActiveTime cell to ACTIVE.
    <li> If the corresponding EventData cell has ActivityEntries, and if the
      cell that is located two cells prior to this one (if it exists) is also
      ACTIVE, then make the cell one cell prior to this one also ACTIVE. (This
      is to fill in &quot;gaps&quot;). 
    </ul>
    <p> <br>
    Note that this algorithm does not deal with &quot;roll-over&quot; between
    days (for example, if someone is active up until midnight but pauses work
    for the first five minutes of the new day, it will be inaccurately recorded
    as INACTIVE.&nbsp; Fixing this on both ends of the day requires getting not
    only the EventData for the current day, but for the day before and the day
    after as well. Until we start getting complaints from the night owls, I'm
    not going to worry about it.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp; </li>
  <li><b>FileTime.</b>&nbsp; The FileTime analysis creates a DayArray in which
    each cell has at most one file name associated with it.&nbsp; This is the
    file that will be allocated a full five minutes of programmer effort.&nbsp;
    To compute this file name, the EventData DayArray is created. Then, for each
    cell in which there exists ActivityEntries with file information, the
    &quot;majority&quot; file name is selected.&nbsp; Ties are decided
    arbitrarily.&nbsp; The accuracy of this analysis will be increased by
    incorporating a timer into the activity sensors that wakes up once per
    minute and records the active buffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    Once we know for each five minute interval what file is getting credit, then
    it is a simple matter to say how much aggregate time was worked on files
    during the day, how much time (if any) a specific file got during a specific
    day, and so forth.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    Note that every cell that is specified to be &quot;Active&quot; in the
    ActiveTime DayArray should have a corresponding file in the FileTime
    DayArray. That means that cells that are empty in the EventTime DayArray may
    have a corresponding file in the FileTime DayArray. (For example, imagine
    cell 1 is active with ActivityEntry data, cell 2 has no ActivityEntry data
    (5 minute break), and cell 3 again has ActivityEntry data. Cell 2 will be
    viewed as &quot;active&quot; because the 15 minute threshold has not been
    reached.&nbsp; Because it's active in the ActiveTime analysis, the FileTime
    analysis must provide a file value for cell 2.&nbsp; An appropriate decision
    is to give it the file value from cell 1.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>SystemTime.</b>&nbsp; The SystemTime analysis is closely related to the
    FileTime analysis and depends upon it.&nbsp; The idea of the SystemTime
    analysis is to look at directory structures and deduce the time spent on
    &quot;systems&quot; as opposed to individual files.&nbsp; For example, it
    would be nice to be able to analyze data on the &quot;Hackystat&quot;
    system, and differentiate it from the &quot;StackMVC&quot; system.&nbsp;
    This may require a certain amount of user tailoring in the configuration
    page. For example, we could provide a list of all of the directory and
    subdirectory structures that we've found thus far, and let the user select
    those that they would like to have viewed as &quot;systems&quot; for the
    purpose of analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>DayArray design comments</h3>
<p>The DayArray is an abstraction that will be shared by all of the daily
analysis classes, and therefore it should be encapsulated into its own class.
The class should be located in hackystat.server.analysis.daily.DayArray.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Analysis classes should prefer composition rather than inheritance in using this
class.&nbsp; Here are some of the operations that the DayArray class should
provide:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A customized Iterator implementation (a DayArrayIterator that implements
    Iterator).&nbsp; As can be seen from the description of the ActiveTime
    analysis, one application of DayArrays is to iterate through them
    sequentially, setting the value of a current cell based upon the values of
    prior (or future) cells. To simplify the implementation of analyses such as
    the ActiveTime class, the DayArrayIterator can provide some additional
    operations in addition to the standard hasNext(), next(), and
    remove().&nbsp; Two such operations are getSubsequent(int) and
    getPrevious(int), which return the object in the DayArray cell some number
    of cells &quot;behind&quot; the current cell or &quot;ahead&quot; of the
    current cell.&nbsp; If that cell does not actually exist (such as when
    calling getPrevious(3) when on the first cell, the call returns null (rather
    than throwing an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception, for example.)&nbsp; This
    iterator instance, returned by the method iterator(), will step through all
    288 elements of the DayArray in order.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Other analyses, such as FileTime, will only want to process the non-empty
    cells in a DayArray.&nbsp; To simplify this coding for analyses such as the
    FileTime class, the DayArray class should provide a second, customized
    iterator implementation.&nbsp; This iterator, returned by the
    nonemptyIterator() method, provides an iterator that only steps sequentially
    through the DayArray but only returns cells that have values.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&nbsp;With both iterators, an index() method should be provided that
    returns an int representing the index of the current cell pointed to by the
    iterator.&nbsp; This integer can take on a value between 0 and
    287.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The DayArray should include get(int) and set(int) methods which get and
    set the DayArray at the locations of the index value passed.&nbsp; These
    methods throw a DayArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException (a subclass of
    java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException) when an index value that is not between
    0 and 287 is passed.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The values stored in a DayArray can be any object.&nbsp; As we begin to
    see common features of DayArray cell storage, we can subclass DayArray and
    provide built-in support for the mechanism. I expect one such common storage
    mechanism will be a Map, so we should provide a subclass of DayArray called
    DayArrayMap in which the cell values are always Map instances.&nbsp; To
    simplify client access,&nbsp; we can provide a get(int, Object) method which
    returns the value whose key is Object at the int index location.&nbsp;
    Similarly , the&nbsp; put(int, Object, Object) method would&nbsp; add the
    key-value pair to a specific index location in the DayArrayMap.&nbsp; Both
    would throw DayArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions when necessary.&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    Another common storage mechanism will be a List, so we could provide a
    second subclass of DayArray called DayArrayList in which cell values are
    always List instances.&nbsp; For this subclass, a useful method would be
    getListIterator(int), that returns a ListIterator over all of the elements
    in the List at the specified index location.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h3>Caching of daily analysis objects</h3>
<p>Every analysis class should consider the need to cache instances of itself,
rather than recompute itself from sensor log data (or other analyses) each time
it is constructed.&nbsp; For example, the EventData analysis object must perform
a relatively time consuming parse of the activity sensor log data file in order
to construct itself.&nbsp; However, we already know that the EventData analysis
object for a given day will be instantiated twice for each user: once in order
to construct the ActiveTime analysis instance, and once in order to construct
the FileTime analysis instance.&nbsp; In both cases, the same identical instance
will be returned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, consider future analyses that operate over
weekly, monthly, or yearly time frames and which accomplish their tasks by
constructing a set of daily analysis instances.&nbsp; It is easy to see that the
EventData analysis object for a given day and a given user might be instantiated
a dozen times or more per day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The abstract hackystat.server.analysis.daily.DailyAnalysis class provides a
generic facility for caching of daily analysis objects.&nbsp; This class
provides a Map instance that maps user directory keys to an interior Map.&nbsp;
The interior Map maps dates to analysis instances.&nbsp; DailyAnalysis
subclasses (such as EventData, ActiveTime, and FileTime), should use a variant
of the Singleton design pattern, in which the constructor is private and
getInstance(DirKey, Date) is used to obtain instances.&nbsp; Unlike the
traditional Singleton pattern, in which the class is guaranteed to have a single
instance, this version has guaranteed to have a single instance for a given user
and date. The getInstance(DirKey, Date) method checks the cache and returns the
stored instance if it exists. Otherwise it constructs an instance using the
private constructor, stores it in the cache, and returns it to the client.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Caching solves one big problem (redundant instance creation overhead) but
creates another big problem: cache entry expiration.&nbsp;&nbsp; To see why this
is an issue, imagine that the user edits the idleTimeThreshold value in his user
configuration page, changing it from 15 minutes to 30 minutes.&nbsp; This has
significant consequences: it is probable that the active, idle, and inactive
times computed for any day's work associated with this user are now different
than they were before. In at least some cases, the user will now have larger
active times for a day because it takes the system will not shift a cell into
&quot;idle&quot; as quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the active times are different,
the FileTimes are different. Also because active times are different, various
alerts which might have been true for a given day when the idleTimeThreshold was
15 minutes (such as the need to have active time &gt; 90 minutes) might now be
false. (In other words, some days in which the user did not make the 90 minute
threshold under the old active time would now be reached under the new
threshold.) Also because active times are different, various &quot;higher
level&quot; analyses (such as weekly, monthly, or yearly summaries) might now
have different values.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I propose that we solve the cache entry expiration in the following way for
now. First, we will limit caching to daily analysis instances.&nbsp; We will
assume that higher level analyses are cheap enough to recompute that they do not
need caching.&nbsp; (I think this is true for now). Second, we will provide a
way for configuration setting changes to wipe out the cache of one or more or
all daily analysis instances for a given user.&nbsp; For example, changing the
value of idleTimeThreshold will wipe out the user's cache values for ActiveTime,
FileTime, and SystemTime.&nbsp; Probably the best way to implement this is by
having subclasses be able to listen to event changes on specific configuration
settings and call their own refresh method when the change has potentially
invalidated their state.</p>
<h3>Alerts</h3>
<p>As noted above, alerts are classes that are invoked on specific analysis
objects to determine if there is some property of the analysis that should be
brought to the attention of the user. They are contained in the
hackystat.server.alert package.&nbsp; Here are some design ideas:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The constructor function takes an analysis instance as its argument.</li>
  <li>Every Alert class implements the hackystat.server.alert.Alert interface.
    This interface specifies the following methods that must be implemented by
    all Alert classes:
    <ul>
    <li> <i>isTriggered()</i>, which is a boolean that returns
    true if that alert has found some property of interest.
    <li> <i>description(),</i> which returns a String providing a text message
      describing what was found that was of interest. This will be included by
      hackystat in the email message.
    <li> <i>displayUrl()</i>, which returns an URL that can be used to retrieve
      a JSP page for this user containing a visual indication of the data that
      caused the alert.
    </ul> 
     </li>
</ul>
<p>In typical usage, hackystat automatically runs the alerts each night,
generates an email to the user containing the alerts and their corresponding
display URLs, and the user responds in some fashion to it.&nbsp;<p>Now let's
consider a new scenario.&nbsp; Suppose that the response of the user is to edit
their configuration settings? For example, assume that the user has been getting
an alert that they're working less than 90 minutes a day for the past
week.&nbsp; Finally, exasperated, the user looks at their configuration settings
and their activity data and decides that this is only happening because the
idleTimeThreshold is set wrong. So, they change their idleTimeThreshold to 30
minutes.&nbsp; The next thing this user will probably want to do is see if they
would still get alerts over the past week given this new alert setting. In other
words, they want to recompute the alerts for the past week.&nbsp;<p>Obviously,
we can't go back in time and send new emails.&nbsp; What we can do, though, is
have a new monthly calendar page that contains the <i>current</i> value of
alerts for a user over the month in question.&nbsp; When this page is requested
from the user's home page, what results is a re-running of the alert instances
for that user for the given month.&nbsp; If at least one alert is triggered for
a given day, then a red dot shows up in that day.&nbsp; If no alerts are
triggered for that day, then a green dot shows up.&nbsp; If there is no data and
thus no alerts are created, then no dot appears.&nbsp; Each of the dots is
actually a link. The link results in re-running the alerts for that specific
day, this time creating a page that presents the output from their description
field and the URL to the accompanying display page.<p>The alert calendar page
adds substantial new value to hackystat data analysis, because it allows users
to get a sense for what things of interest exist in their data as they evolve
their configuration over time, and as the set of alerts changes over time. (Note
that when we implement a new alert, the user can bring up this page to see the
impact of invoking the new alert over their past 30 days of data.)&nbsp;<p>A
final design property of alerts is that they should be able to be configured as
well as enabled or disabled by individual users.&nbsp; Let's say that we
implement an alert called MinimumActiveTime.&nbsp; This alert is designed to be
triggered when the user has some active time on a day but it does not go over a
specific threshold value.&nbsp; First, this threshold value can be configured in
the UserConfiguration page to a set of values such as 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180,
or 240 minutes. Second, this alert can be disabled by a particular user if they
don't feel it adds value.&nbsp; Over time, we will figure out a &quot;default
set&quot; of alerts that a user will be provided with when they register with
Hackystat. Then, through their UserConfiguration page, they can decide upon the
set of alerts that add value to their development style and the appropriate
settings for each.&nbsp;<h3>Activity Sensor Timers</h3>
<p>Our approach to analysis suggests the need to augment our current JBuilder
and Emacs activity sensors with an additional functionality.&nbsp; This
functionality is a timer-based mechanism that wakes up and records the file that
the user is currently working on, if they are actively working on it.&nbsp;
Although there are many different plausible ways to do this, it is quite
important that the approach that we use be feasible in both the Emacs and
JBuilder sensors, as well as any other IDE sensors we decide to provide support
for. Therefore, it should be a kind of &quot;minimal&quot; implementation.&nbsp;
My proposal is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>There is a new ActivityType, called ACTIVE_BUFFER_STATE_CHANGE.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Each Activity sensor implements a timer. This timer wakes up once every 60
    seconds.&nbsp; When it wakes up, it checks to see if EITHER (a) the active
    buffer being edited is different from the one that was being edited the last
    time the timer work up, OR (b) the current position (or size) of the buffer
    is different than it was 60 seconds ago.&nbsp; If either (a) or (b) is true,
    then the timer adds a new activity entry with the current time as the
    timestamp, the ActivityType ACTIVE_BUFFER_STATE_CHANGE, and the name of the
    file currently being edited by the active buffer.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Editors that support multiple browsers and/or frames (like both Emacs and
    JBuilder) need to be careful to ensure that only one timer is created and
    that only one Activity entry of type ACTIVE_BUFFER_STATE_CHANGE can be
    recorded per minute.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this mechanism is implemented, then we can use this set of activity
types to implement our FileTime analysis.&nbsp; One algorithm is to check in
each DayArray cell for all activities of this activity type.&nbsp; Then, the
file mentioned in the most entries is the &quot;winner&quot; and gets the five
minutes allocated to them.&nbsp; If there is a tie, pick the first file in the
list of leaders. If there are other activity types, but none of type
ACTIVE_BUFFER_STATE_CHANGE, then use the file type from the last cell.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>This lays out quite a bit of work.&nbsp; The order of work is approximately
as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Implement the ActivitySensor Timer mechanism and the DayArray abstraction.
  </li>
  <li>Implement the initial analysis objects: EventData, ActiveTime, FileTime</li>
