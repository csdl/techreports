<p>In order to automate the size, time and defect data collection process,
presto needs to listen to the events which are fired by the IDE. The events may
be application level events, project level events or file level events. So, One
may think of following classes being provided by the IDE : <code>IDEApplicationEvent,
IDEProjectEvent, IDEFileEvent, IDEEditorEvent and IDEDebuggerEvent. </code>Whenever
an event is fired by the IDE, presto should be able to listen to that event.
Then, it should be able to determine to which class of events the fired event
belongs to. After knowing that, presto can know the exact event and take
appropriate action. The following code illustrates this point for the case of
project opening event. This code may be placed in an IDE events listening class
of presto.</p>
<p>&nbsp; <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (event instanceof
IDEProjectEvent) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
IDEProjectEvent projectEvent = (IDEProjectEvent)event;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (projectEvent.getID() ==
IDEProjectEvent.PROJECT_OPENED) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
this.projectOpened();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</code><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from these event classes, presto also needs the
classes which provide it the information about projects and files. So, following
classes will be needed by presto : <code>IDEApplication, IDEProject, IDEFile,
IDEEditor and IDEDebugger</code>. Whenever presto needs the information like
what is the current project, what are the files in the current project, which
file is currently being worked on etc., presto should be able to inquire this
information from these classes. The following code illustrates how one can get
the information about the name of the project being currently worked on :</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<code>IDEProject project = (IDEProject)IDEApplication.getCurrentProject();<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; String projectName = project.getName();</code></p>
<p>Now, after listing the classes required, we can go into the specific details
of the classes that would be needed by presto.<br>
</p>
<h3>Application level requirements</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though we are concerned with collecting project size,
time and defect data, presto do needs application level information like when
the IDE is opened or closed, what is the current project, what is the file being
worked on in the editor etc. This information&nbsp; is useful for presto and can
be provided by application level classes. A brief description of application
level classes and their method signatures is as follows :</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <code><strong>IDEApplication</strong></code> : This class
represents the entire IDE application. Information related to all the projects
can be obtained from here. Its method signatures are as follows :</p>
<table height="130" width="100%" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%" height="36"><code><strong>void&nbsp;
        addListener(IDEEventListener newListener);</strong></code><br>
        adds a IDE event listener to the list of current listener.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%" height="38"><code><strong>IDEProject getCurrentProject();</strong></code><br>
        returns the currently opened project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%" height="38"><code><strong>IDEEditor getCurrentEditor();</strong></code><br>
        returns the file currently opened in the editor.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <code><strong>IDEApplicationEvent</strong></code> : This
class is responsible for getting information about all application level events
like application opening events, application closing events etc. Its method and
field signatures are as follows :</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><code><strong>static int APPLICATION_CLOSING</strong></code><br>
        Indicates that IDE application is closing</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>static int APPLICATION_OPENED</code></strong><br>
        Indicates that IDE application has just been opened</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>int getID()</code></strong><br>
        returns the event ID of the event</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Project level requirements</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though IDEs allow users to work on several projects,
only one project can be opened at a time. Presto can obtain the information
about the currently opened project from application level classes which return
an project level object. Once presto has project level object, it can aquire
details specific to a project like name of the project, path to the project
file, the files in the project etc. This information is used by the presto to
record the time data related to a project. This may also provide presto with
size information from a bigger perspective. However, In order to obtain the
detailed size information, one needs to make use of file level objects. A brief
description of project level classes and their method signatures is as follows :</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><code>IDEProject</code></strong> : This class
represents an IDE project. The information specific to a project can be obtained
from here. Its method signatures are as follows :</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><code><strong>void&nbsp; addListener(IDEProjectListener
        newListener);</strong></code><br>
        adds a IDE event listener to the list of current listeners.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>String getName();</code></strong><br>
        returns the name of the project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>String getPath();</code></strong><br>
        returns the path of the project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>Collection getAllFiles();</code></strong><br>
        returns all the files in the current project.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>boolean isOpen()</code></strong>;<br>
        determines whether a project is opened or not.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><code>IDEProjectEvent</code></strong> : This class is
responsible for getting information about all project level events like project
opening events, project closing events etc. Its method and field signatures are
as follows :</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><code><strong>static int PROJECT_OPENED</strong></code><br>
        Indicates that a project has opened</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>static int PROJECT_CLOSED</code></strong><br>
        Indicates that a project has been closed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>static int PROJECT_NEW</code></strong><br>
        Indicates that a new project has been made</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>int getID()</code></strong><br>
        returns the event ID of the event</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>File level requirements</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size information in detail can be obtained using file
level objects. We can obtain size information like LOC, number of methods,
number of classes, number of interfaces etc. either from IDE file objects or
using some external size measuring tools. Presto uses external size measuring
tools in order to reduce the requirements from the file level objects. Presto
doesn't uses file level objects to obtain the time data related to a project.
Time data is collected only at the project level. A brief description of project
level classes and their method signatures is as follows :</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><code>IDEFile</code></strong> : This class
represents an IDE file. The information specific to a file can be obtained from
here. Its method signatures are as follows :</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><code><strong>void&nbsp; addListener(IDEFileListener
        newListener);</strong></code><br>
        adds a IDE event listener to the list of current listeners.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>String getName();</code></strong><br>
        returns the name of the file.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>String getPath();</code></strong><br>
        returns the path of the file.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong><code>&nbsp; IDEFileEvent</code></strong> : This class is responsible
for getting information about all file level events like file opening events,
file closing events etc. Its method and field signatures are as follows :</p>
<table width="100%" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><code><strong>static int FILE_OPENED</strong></code><br>
        Indicates that a file has opened</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>static int FILE_CLOSED</code></strong><br>
        Indicates that a file has been closed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>static int FILE_SAVED</code></strong><br>
        Indicates that a file has been saved</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><strong><code>int getID()</code></strong><br>
        returns the event ID of the event</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
