<p align="left">As we all know by now, there is the presumption in Hackystat
that developers are too busy to &quot;do anything&quot; with respect to process
data collection and analysis. Hackystat must collect time, size, project,
defect, and potentially other kinds of data quietly and in the background, and
somehow combine the data together to form analyses that it makes available to
the user at periodic intervals via web pages whose URLs it sends to the user in
an email. There are all of the traditional potential PSP-style benefits of this
data. However, there's another form of data that I think we want to be
manipulating in hackystat, and which violates the above paradigm by being
something that the developer(s) have to explicitly create and maintain. I will
call this kind of data the &quot;Task list&quot; for now. (Other synonyms could
be &quot;defect list&quot;, &quot;to do list&quot;, &quot;user story list&quot;,
&quot;work breakdown structure&quot;, &quot;change request list&quot;, and so
forth. I would like the task list to be an extremely lightweight, generic form
of this data). </p>
<p align="left">The reason why the Task List has to be maintained explicitly is
simple: the only kind of data that we can even potentially collect automatically
reflects events that have occurred in the past. The Task List refers to events
in the future. By combining together data about the past with data about the
future, I think we open up hackystat to provide very interesting new kinds of
support for software development. In particular, I think we can come a lot
closer to the XP view of metrics as something you collect in order to understand
the &quot;state&quot; of the project. (And, if we do this properly, we can
provide that without sacrificing the &quot;developer improvement&quot; goal of
the more traditional projects.) I think that even though the task list requires
explicit developer maintenance, there's a good chance we can get them to do it
because some sort to ToDo list is maintained anyway in every development project
of nontrivial size and complexity, whether the project is done by one person or
many. I certainly know that I keep a todo list for my current software projects,
and I know that for the Inca development project the maintenance of a simple
&quot;bugs.html&quot; page was critical to keeping the team working together
productively. </p>
<p align="left">That's not to say that an adoptable task list tool will be easy
to design and implement. To make it adoptable, I believe we will have to satisfy
the following requirements: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Free. Other change request tools can often be quite
    expensive. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Easy to install. I think a Java webapp deployable on
    something like Tomcat that is browser-based will work. I view Bugzilla as an
    example of a web tool that is unecessarily hard to install. If it takes
    longer than 5 minutes to get going, that's too long. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Easy to extend and modify by developers. Lots of
    implications here, from the quality of the code to the quality of the design
    to the quality of the documentation. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Easy to use. This is something that we really need to think
    hard about. We're not competing against bugzilla or clearcase as much as
    we're competing against pencil and paper, or an ascii text file, or a simple
    html page like bugs.html. I propose that we start with something radically
    easy to use, and scale up the complexity only as required. There should be
    no need for users to need to read documentation before using it. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Provides value. Making it easy to use is only half the
    adoptability battle. Unless it's easy to use AND adds significant value, it
    won't fly. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Now let me add the following critical simplifying
    assumption: Assume a small and collegial group of users. In other words, the
    system will run in a &quot;secure&quot; environment and can assume that the
    small number of users are &quot;friendly&quot;. By &quot;small&quot;, I mean
    a number less than 25 or so.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">Here's some initial ideas on how to combine ease of use and
value. </p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Everything is a &quot;task&quot;. Bug reports, change
    requests, user stories, proposed enhancements, etc. are all simply tasks. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Each user logs in by providing their name and email. After
    initial login, a user can later simply select their name from a drop-down
    list. A password field could be supplied later. </li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Tasks have the following fields:
      <ul>
      <li> <b> Title </b> (text line)&nbsp;
      <li> <b>Reported by:</b> (prefilled with logged in user name)&nbsp;
      <li> <b>Project</b> : (keywords)&nbsp;
      <li> <b>Status</b>: (keywords)&nbsp;
      <li> <b>Priority</b>: (keywords)&nbsp;
      <li> <b>Description</b>: (text area)&nbsp;
      <li> <b>Followups</b>: (text area) &quot;Followups&quot;
    allow users to add supplemental info about the progress of the task.
      <li> <b>Assigned to</b>: (keywords)&nbsp;
      <li> The above are traditional,
    but I'd also like to propose two new fields that can add significant new
    value when combined with other hackystat data:&nbsp;
      <li> <b>Estimated complete date:</b>
    (date field)
    &quot;Estimated complete date&quot; allows the system to add a lot of value
    about what is expected to occur in future, what tasks have a deadline
    looming, _and_ how the estimated complete date changes over time (the
    estimated complete date field can, like any other, be changed over time).
      <li> <b>Test cases:</b> (text line, comma separated)
    
    The &quot;Test cases&quot; field allows hackystat to connect tasks to the
    executing parts of the system, and can enable hackystat to (a) verify that a
    task was operating correctly (b) connect a failed test case to one or more
    task descriptions, and (c) connect a failed test case back to one or more
    users who may need to be informed about it.&nbsp;
    </ul>
    
  </li>
  <li>Reduce or eliminate &quot;configuration&quot;.
    Let's try to avoid having to &quot;define&quot; projects, status values, etc
    before using them. Instead, I suggest the following: anywhere a
    &quot;keyword&quot; element (such as a priority, project, etc.) occurs,
    allow the user to type in a value or select a preexisting value from a pull
    down list. Every time a task is submitted to the system, if the value of a
    field is different from those that are stored, it is saved and presented in
    the pull down list the next time. That way, the set of &quot;keywords&quot;
    can be built implicitly and incrementally. It is inevitable, of course, that
    occasionally a keyword will be mischosen and need to be changed.&nbsp;</li>
  <li> We must
    provide a separate page to support global renaming of keywords. This is
    different from editing a preexisting task to reassigning a keyword, such as
    changing the &quot;assigned to&quot; name.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Every modification of the task
    list generates an email to all users with a summary of the change. This
    follows from the simplifying assumption above: the system is oriented toward
    a small group of collegial developers. This means that everyone will want to
    know about all changes to the task list, or at least won't get upset about
    getting the emails.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>The tasks are stored in XML similar to the hackystat
    approach. I have the following reasons for this (potentially controversial)
    choice; (a) we can get the system running extremely quickly if we leverage
    the hackystat code. (b) it's a very lightweight solution that makes the
    system more modifiable. (c) it makes the data from this system easily
    accessable to hackystat, so we can leverage it in our analyses. (d) It
    allows us to generate reports from the XML using XSL, rather than generating
    HTML and so forth. We will need a few servlets and JSP pages for entry and
    editing, of course.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Resources: There are some good online pages that we
    can leverage. Here are some that I've found to be useful:
     <ul>
     <li> <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/bugs/">http://www.mozilla.org/bugs/</a>&nbsp;
     <li> <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html">http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html</a>&nbsp;
     <li> <a href="http://www.elementool.com/">http://www.elementool.com/</a>&nbsp;
     <li> <a href="http://www.elementool.com/demo/2.html">http://www.elementool.com/demo/2.html</a>&nbsp;
     <li> <a href="http://www.testingfaqs.org/t-track.htm">http://www.testingfaqs.org/t-track.htm</a>
    </ul>
    </ul>
    I'd like to get such a tool working as soon as possible, with the idea that
    we can start using it to guide hackystat development and develop it further
    based upon our experience. Let me know what you think.
