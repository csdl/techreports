    <p align="left"><b>[Note: This technical report contains a recent snapshot
    of the Hackystat Installation Guide.&nbsp; Please use the README.html file
    included in your hackystat distribution for the most recent and accurate
    installation instructions for your particular release.]</b></p>


    <p align="left">Welcome to the installation
guide for  Hackystat.&nbsp;
    Hackystat is designed to explore the mechanisms required for (and
    implications of) fully automated software developer data collection and
    analysis.&nbsp; For more information on the goals of Hackystat, see the <a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/Hackystat/">Hackystat
    Research Page</a>.&nbsp;</p>


    <h2 align="left">0. Do you need to read these instructions?</h2>


    <p align="left">For most Hackystat users, the answer is no.&nbsp; If you
    simply want to install Hackystat sensors in order to collect and analyze
    your software engineering data, and if there is a Hackystat server available
    for your use, then what you should do instead of reading these instructions
    is:</p>


    <ol>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Open your browser and go to the home page of the
        Hackystat server. (CSDL maintains a public hackystat server; contact
        Philip Johnson for the URL.)</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Follow the links on the server home page to the
        installation instructions for the sensors you wish to install.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Install the sensors.</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left">Restart your tools, and Hackystat will begin collecting
        and analyzing your data.&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p align="left">If, on the other hand, you are interested in installing your
    own Hackystat server, and/or doing development on the Hackystat code base,
    then read on.&nbsp;</p>


    <h2 align="left">1. Hackystat Distributions</h2>


    <p align="left">Hackystat is distributed in three flavors:</p>


    <ol>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>A &quot;binary&quot; distribution.</b>&nbsp; This
        distribution provides just enough files to get the server up and running.&nbsp; Once
        you have the server running, you can download and install the sensor
        code from the server. Binary distributions are distributed as .zip
        files, such as <font face="Courier New">hackystat-pota-bin.zip</font>.&nbsp;
        The top-level directory will be named with a label indicating the
        release name, such as &quot;hackystat-pota&quot; (for the Planet of the
        Apes release).&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>A &quot;source snapshot&quot; distribution.&nbsp;</b>
        This distribution provides the binary distribution plus all of the source files and allows
        you to recompile and rebuild. Source snapshot distributions are also distributed
        as .zip files, such as <font face="Courier New">hackystat-pota-src.zip</font>,
        and the top-level directory includes the release label.&nbsp; Normally, the only reason to download the
        source distribution
        is to evaluate the system and decide whether you want to become a
        developer.&nbsp; If so, you'll want to discard the source distribution
        and download the developer distribution.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <p align="left"><b>A &quot;developer&quot; distribution.</b>&nbsp; This
        distribution enables you to participate in the actual development of the system. You
        need to have CVS installed and obtain the CVS password to the Hackystat
        repository. The top-level directory for CVS distributions is called
        &quot;hackystat&quot; regardless of the release currently being worked
        on.</li>
    </ol>


<h2>2. Structure of the distribution</h2>
    The hackystat distribution is structured in terms of a number of
    subdirectories.&nbsp; The top-level directory in the table below uses the
    CVS distribution name (i.e. hackystat) rather than the source or binary
    distribution name that includes the release label (ie. hackystat-pota).&nbsp;Not
    all directories are available in all distributions; the table below
    indicates their availability.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;

<table border="1" width="846">
<tr><th width="144">Directory/File <th width="99">Available in <th width="581">Contents

    <h2>3. Installing
    the distributions</h2>
    <p>

This build system is based on Jakarta Ant.&nbsp; Ant uses a build file written in XML
(<A HREF="build.xml">build.xml</A>) as building instructions. For more
information refer to <A HREF="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/</A>.</p>

    <p>Hackystat installation involves the following general steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Download and install the infrastructure technologies (java, tomcat)</li>
      <li>Configure tomcat for hackystat..</li>
      <li>Bring up the hackystat server.</li>
      <li>Download and install the sensors for tools from the hackystat server.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The following directions require several environment variables to be
    set.&nbsp; Procedures for setting environment variables differ widely across
    Windows and Unix platforms, and these instructions assume you know how to
    set environment variables on the platform you are using. The screenshots are
    generated from an installation on Windows2000, but Hackystat has also been
    successfully installed on other Windows and Unix platforms including
    Windows98, Windows/NT, Solaris 7, and RedHat Linux.</p>
    <h3>A. Download and install Java</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Download Java from <a href="http://java.sun.com/">http://java.sun.com/</a>.&nbsp;
        The version should be 1.3 or above.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Set the environment variable JAVA_HOME to point to the Java
        installation directory.</li>
      <li>Test your Java installation by invoking JAVA_HOME/bin/java.exe
        -version.&nbsp; It should print out version information&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README1.jpg" width="564" height="143"></p>

    <h3>B. Download and install Tomcat</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Download Tomcat from <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/">http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/</a>.&nbsp;
        Please download version 3.2.x.&nbsp; Version 4.0 is a complete rewrite
        and we do not expect that these instructions will work on Tomcat
        V4.0.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Set the environment variable TOMCAT_HOME to point to the Tomcat
        installation directory.</li>
      <li>Read the Tomcat installation instructions included with the
        distribution.</li>
      <li>Test your Tomcat installation by invoking the TOMCAT_HOME\bin\startup
        script and retrieving the Tomcat home page. The following three screen
        shots show: (1) the invocation of the startup script, (2) the tomcat
        startup output, and (3) the Tomcat home page displayed in the web
        browser after browsing to <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>.&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README2.jpg" width="668" height="167"></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README3.jpg" width="668" height="155"></p>
    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README4.jpg" width="671" height="219"></p>
    <p>Note that the current hackystat installation process assumes that this
    Tomcat installation will be dedicated to Hackystat.&nbsp; If you are using
    Tomcat elsewhere in your environment, it is safest to download a fresh copy
    that is used just for Hackystat&nbsp;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Now bring down your Tomcat server using the TOMCAT_HOME\bin\shutdown
        script:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README6.jpg" width="604" height="179"></p>

    <h3>C. Download Hackystat</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Download a hackystat distribution (either source, binary, or
        developer).&nbsp; Contact Philip Johnson for details on how to obtain
        the distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;
    </li>
    
      <li> Note that due to a bug in java.util.zip, the directory permissions are
    munged if you unzip in Unix, and you won't be able to cd into the hackystat
        directory.&nbsp; To fix this, just invoke the following:<br>
        <font face="Courier New">
    chmod -R a+x &lt;hackystat distribution directory&gt;</font>

    </li>
    
    </ul>

    <h3>D. Configure Hackystat environment variables</h3>

    <ul>
    
      <li> Set the following hackystat environment variables, which are used by
        the Ant build scripts<br>
        <table border="1" width="85%">
          <tr>
            <td width="36%"><b>E</b><b>nv variable (upper case required)</b></td>
            <td width="64%"><b>Example value (set to values appropriate for your
              installation)</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="36%">HACKYSTAT_HOST</td>
            <td width="64%">http://localhost:8080/&nbsp;
              (note the trailing slash is required)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="36%">HACKYSTAT_HOME</td>
            <td width="64%">c:\hackystat&nbsp; (note that NO trailing slash is
              required)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="36%">HACKYSTAT_MAIL_SERVER</td>
            <td width="64%">smtp-server.hawaii.edu</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="36%">HACKYSTAT_ADMIN_EMAIL</td>
            <td width="64%">johnson@hawaii.edu</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
    </li>
    
      <li>Set the TOMCAT_OPTS environment variable to provide the Tomcat server
        with access to the above values through the Java system properties
        object.&nbsp; This involves the use of the &quot;-D&quot; option.&nbsp;
        Make sure the property keys are lowercase as noted below, and substitute
        the example property values below with values appropriate to your
        installation as above:<br>
        <table border="1" width="85%">
          <tr>
            <td width="36%">TOMCAT_OPTS</td>
            <td width="64%">-Dhackystat_host=http://localhost:8080/<br>
              -Dhackystat_mail_server=smtp-server.hawaii.edu<br>
              -Dhackystat_admin_email=johnson@hawaii.edu</td>
          </tr>
        </table><p>
        Note that these "-D" arguments should all be on one line although they may not appear that way in these installation notes.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;
      </li>
    
      <li><p>There are two other environment variables used by Hackystat that
        you do not need to set for a basic installation of the server.&nbsp; The
        HACKYSTAT_USER_EMAIL environment email is used by some sensors to
        determine the user that data is being collected for.&nbsp; The
        JBUILDER_HOME environment variable is needed to recompile the JBuilder
        sensor code.&nbsp;</li>
    
    </ul>

<pre>&nbsp;</pre>

<h3 align="left">E. Build the hackystat.jar executable</h3>

    <p align="left">Whether or not you do this step depends upon the
    distribution you obtained.&nbsp; The <i>binary</i> distribution includes the
    hackystat.jar file in the lib directory, so you do not need to build
    hackystat.jar.&nbsp; Moreover, since it does not include source, you cannot
    build hackystat.jar.&nbsp; The <i>source</i> distribution includes the
    hackystat.jar file in the lib directory, and does include source, so this
    step is optional and you can skip it if you like.&nbsp; In fact, skipping it
    is strongly recommended unless you are able to recompile all of the sensor
    code.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <i>developer</i> distribution does not&nbsp; include
    hackystat.jar and so this step is required.&nbsp;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>

    To build or rebuild the
        hackystat.jar file,&nbsp; invoke <font face="Courier New">build
        package</font>::</li>
    </ul>
<pre><img border="0" src="screenshots/README5.jpg" width="604" height="503">
</pre>


    <h3>F. Configuring Tomcat with Soap, Cocoon, and Hackystat&nbsp;</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Now you will provide Tomcat with the appropriate library files.&nbsp;
        To do this, invoke <font face="Courier New">build configureTomcat</font>:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README7.jpg" width="604" height="599"><br>
  &nbsp;</p>
    This accomplishes the following:
<ul>
  <li>The TOMCAT_HOME\lib directory gets the executables
  required by SOAP, Cocoon, and Hackystat:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>SOAP:</b> soap.jar, apache_xerces.jar, mail.jar, activation.jar,
    xml4j.jar
    <li> <b>Cocoon: </b>cocoon.jar, fop_0_15_0.jar, apache_xerces.jar,
    turbine_pool.jar, w3c.jar, xalan_1_2_D02.jar&nbsp;
    <li> <b>Hackystat: </b>hackystat.jar, jdom.jar, sax2.jar&nbsp;
    </ul>
   <li> The TOMCAT_HOME\webapps directory gets the following subdirectories and
    associated files:
     <ul>
     <li> webapps/soap
     <li> webapps/cocoon
     <li> webapps/hackystat
     </ul>
</ul>

    <h3>G. Remove jaxp.jar</h3>
    <ul>
<li> Remove the file TOMCAT_HOME\lib\jaxp.jar if present.  (apache_xerces will be used for XML
  parsing.)&nbsp; Note that this step may not be necessary, but has been reported to
  avoid problems in Cocoon.
  </ul>

<h3>H. Edit the Tomcat server.xml file</h3>

<ul>
<li> Add the following context entries to TOMCAT_HOME\conf\server.xml.&nbsp; (Don't
  cut and paste from this document; it appears to generate parser errors.)<pre>
  &lt;Context path=&quot;/apache-soap&quot;
           docBase=&quot;webapps/soap&quot;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; debug=&quot;1&quot;
           reloadable=&quot;false&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/Context&gt;

  &lt;Context path=&quot;/cocoon&quot;
           docBase=&quot;webapps/cocoon&quot;
           debug=&quot;0&quot;
           reloadable=&quot;false&quot; &gt;
  &lt;/Context&gt;

  &lt;Context path=&quot;/hackystat&quot;
           docBase=&quot;webapps/hackystat&quot;
           debug=&quot;0&quot;
           reloadable=&quot;false&quot; &gt;
  &lt;/Context&gt;
  </pre>
  
<li> Edit the following RequestInterceptor entry in TOMCAT_HOME\conf\server.xml, setting suppress="true" so that 
directory listings are not shown. This is critical so that users cannot browse into other user's 
data areas.&nbsp; Here's what it should look like after modification:<pre>
&lt;RequestInterceptor
  className=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.request.StaticInterceptor&quot;
  debug=&quot;0&quot; suppress=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
</pre>

<li> By default, Tomcat listens for http requests on port 8080. If you want to run Hackystat on some other port, you need 
to edit the following entry in server.xml to change the port from 8080 to your
  preferred port number.<pre>
&lt;Connector className=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.PoolTcpConnector&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Parameter name=&quot;handler&quot; 
             value=&quot;org.apache.tomcat.service.http.HttpConnectionHandler&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;Parameter name=&quot;port&quot; 
             value=&quot;8080&quot;/&gt;
 &lt;/Connector&gt;
</pre>
  Remember to also change the port value in HACKYSTAT_HOST and TOMCAT_OPTS! 
    </ul>
    <h3>I. Test the configured Tomcat installation.</h3>
<p>

To test your Tomcat configuration,&nbsp; invoke the TOMCAT_HOME\bin\startup
script again, and check to make sure that no message appears concerning the
use of a "static" classpath.  If so, you need to edit the tomcat.bat file to set the CLASSPATH
correctly.  Otherwise, you should see all of the files you copied into the lib directory
in the tomcat classpath.&nbsp; Here's what the command prompt window and the
tomcat output should look like after configuration:
<p>

<img border="0" src="screenshots/README8.jpg" width="660" height="179">
<p>

<img border="0" src="screenshots/README9.jpg" width="668" height="191"><p>

If everything is OK so far, then tomcat should now be running. Try retrieving
the following pages to check the configuration and make sure that Tomcat, Soap and
Cocoon are available (substituting your own host address for localhost:8080 if
    necessary):
    <ul>
      <li>Tomcat home page:  <a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a></li>

    </ul>

    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README10.jpg" width="675" height="213"></p>
    <ul>

      <li>Soap admin page:  <a href="http://localhost:8080/apache-soap/admin">http://localhost:8080/apache-soap/admin</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README11.jpg" width="680" height="276"></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cocoon admin page:&nbsp; <a href="http://localhost:8080/cocoon/Cocoon.xml">http://localhost:8080/cocoon/Cocoon.xml</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        (Note that there is no actual file named Cocoon.xml in the
        distribution--this URL invokes a Cocoon servlet.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README12.jpg" width="788" height="313"></p>

    <h3>J. Deploy Hackystat services</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Next, you need to tell Tomcat and SOAP about the hackystat-specific SOAP services.
        Invoke <font face="Courier New">build deploy:</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README13.jpg" width="620" height="395"></p>
This command will deploy the Hackystat services, then list them out. If you get
    an &quot;unsupported response content type&quot; error, see the FAQ
    below.&nbsp;

<h3>K. Run the JUnit tests</h3>
    <p>To finish verifying your installation, you should run the Hackystat JUnit
    test suite.&nbsp; Invoke: <font face="Courier New">build testInstall</font>.</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README14.jpg" width="628" height="575"></p>
    <p>Do not be misled by the &quot;BUILD SUCCESSFUL&quot; notification: that
    does not mean the tests all passed successfully.&nbsp; You need to make sure
    that &quot;Failures: 0&quot; appears for each test case as in the example
    screen dump above.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If all the tests passed successfully, congratulations!&nbsp; You have
    successfully installed the Hackystat server.</p>
    <h3>L.&nbsp; Download and install sensors</h3>
    <p>In order to actually collect and analyze software engineering data, you
    must now install one or more Hackystat sensors.&nbsp; To do this, you go to
    the home page for the server you've just installed and follow the links to
    the sensor installation page of choice:</p>
    <p><img border="0" src="screenshots/README15.jpg" width="673" height="341"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>M.&nbsp; Play with the sample application SimpleTimer (Optional)</h3>
    <p>SimpleTimer is a simple application designed to show how data can be sent
    to a Hackystat server.&nbsp; Unlike real sensors, which are downloaded from
    the server and which send data automatically, SimpleTimer is an application
    that is included with the server distribution only and which requires the
    user to manually send time data.&nbsp; Try the following once you
    have the hackystat server up and running:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure the following environment variables are set:

        <table border="1" width="85%">
          <tr>
            <td width="36%"><b>Env variable (upper case required)</b></td>
            <td width="64%"><b>Example value (set to values appropriate for your
              installation)</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="36%">HACKYSTAT_HOST</td>
            <td width="64%">http://localhost:8080/&nbsp;
              (note the trailing slash is required)</td>

      <li>Invoke SimpleTimer.&nbsp; From the hackystat directory, in windows,

        runSimpleTimer.sh script if you're using Unix. Here's the invocation and
        the resulting SimpleTimer window showing the timer collecting some time:</li>

    <ul>
      <li>To collect some time, press the start button icon (a triangle).&nbsp;
        Once time is being collected, the start button icon turns into a stop
        button icon (a square).&nbsp; When you're ready to stop collecting time,
        press the stop button icon.&nbsp; To send the data off to the Hackystat
        server, press the &quot;Record&quot; button. There is also a pause
        button icon (two vertical bars) that toggle pausing of time data
        collection. Finally, the text field allows you to enter the names of the
        files you were working on.&nbsp; SimpleTimer is not intended to be used
        for real data collection, but rather to illustrate to developers and
        initial users how data is collected and sent.&nbsp;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        If this is the first time you've sent data to this
        hackystat server, you'll&nbsp;subsequently receive an email message from
        the server providing you with links to your personal data area.<br>

<h2>4. Technology dependencies</h2>

Hackystat is built using a fairly large number of&nbsp; supplemental technologies, some of which
are small and can be included with this distribution, while others must be downloaded separately.
The following lists the tools required; those with a (*) are not provided with this distribution
    and must be downloaded and installed separately.

      version of xerces appears to work with all three of these tools.&nbsp; Several issues: (1) Soap 2.1 breaks on Xerces 3.2.1 so an older
      release is recommended. (2) xerces.jar must go
      early in the tomcat path before any other XML parser, so I renamed it to
      apache_xerces so that tomcat's auto-classpath constructor will find it
      early. (3) Cocoon 1.8.2 requires Xerces 1.2.&nbsp;

<p>

In other words, you need to download and install Java and Tomcat, but everything else is
included in the lib directory of the Hackystat distribution.
Note that the world is in flux, and it is possible that a new release of Java or Tomcat may be
incompatible with the versions of the other tools that are provided with this distribution.
Please contact us if you appear to encounter compatibility problems.

<h2>6. FAQ</h2>

<ol>

<li> <i> I get the following error when I try to "build deploy":</i>
<pre><i>
[SOAPException: faultCode=SOAP-ENV:Protocol;
msg=Unsupported response content type &quot;text/html;
charset=ISO8859-1&quot;, must be: &quot;text/xml&quot;.

(more stuff follows)</i><b>
</b></pre>
This message typically occurs when the server can't be found, and
most likely indicates that your HACKYSTAT_HOST value is incorrect.
Make sure, for example, that it includes the "8080" port number if
you're running on the default Tomcat port.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;
<li><i>I am using Windows 95/98/ME and get the following error:</i>
<pre><i>
Out of environment space</i><b>
</b></pre>
This is an infamous Windows "bug". To fix it on Windows 95/98, you need to edit your config.sys file and
add the following line:
<pre>
shell=C:\command.com /e:4096 /p
</pre>
(Or whatever the path is to command.com on your system.)&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  On WindowsME, config.sys statements are ignored
and you have to include your environment variables in the Autoexec.bat file. See the
  <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q261/8/25.ASP"> Microsoft
Knowledge Base</a> for more details. To ensure that the changes take effect, you
  should restart your computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;
</li>

<li><i>I am using Windows 95/98/ME, and Step 4 fails when trying to retrieve the
  Cocoon.xml admin servlet.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
  </i>This is probably due to the failure of Tomcat to automatically set up its
  classpath correctly.&nbsp; You will have to set the classpath manually in
  either the tomcat.bat file or in your autoexec.bat file.&nbsp; The classpath
  used by tomcat should include all of the jar files in the tomcat/lib directory
  (after &quot;build install&quot;) in alphabetical order. <br>
  &nbsp; </li>
<li><i>I get the following error message when I try to retrieve Cocoon.xml in Step
  4:</i><pre><i>
  Publishing Engine could not be initialized.</i>
  </pre>
  This is probably due to apache_xerces.jar not being first in the tomcat
  classpath, or parser.jar coming before apache_xerces.jar in the Tomcat
  classpath.&nbsp; One potential way to fix this is to change the line
  <pre>
SET CP=%CP%;%CLASSPATH%
</pre>
into
<pre>
SET CP=%CLASSPATH%;%CP%
</pre>
Other approaches can work as long as they result in the classpath
including all the .jar files in tomcat/lib and their being listed
in alphabetical order.  This happens by default when Tomcat succeeds in
building the classpath automatically.
</li>
