<p>The ICS department has a problem. Each semester, over 700 ICS majors and
graduate students, along with hundreds of non-ICS majors and unclassified
graduate students, compete for seats in the dozen or so ICS courses offered.</p>
<p>Back when interest in the ICS curriculum began to explode on campus, a simple, manual
system was implemented: anyone wanting admittance to an ICS course needed to
send an email with their request to a special account (uhmics@hawaii.edu)
specifying their course requests. That email was read by an ICS administrator,
who would grant or deny the request based upon the seats available and the
student's background.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This manual system was instituted in order to provide more fairness in course
assignment than that provided by Pa'e. In Pa'e, the only priority is by class
level, which means Seniors get to register before Juniors, and so forth.
Allowing the Pa'e prioritization rules to control our course enrollment would
lead to disproportionate numbers of upper-level, non-ICS majors in our
lower-level courses, severely limiting the ability of lower-level undergraduates
to take the entry level courses required to become an ICS major.&nbsp; Our manual system allowed us to take
control back from Pa'e and try to ensure that our classes would be filled
appropriately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that there are well over a thousand students interested in one or more
ICS courses each semester, the manual system (and its unlucky
administrator) is overwhelmed. With thousands of requests to process, it is no
longer clear whether the best possible decisions are being made on who should be
admitted to the program. Furthermore, the requests themselves form interesting,
unexploited information about the interest in the program and the kinds of
classes in demand. For example, analyzing the requests each semester would show,
for example, how many additional sections of ICS 111 would be needed to meet the
total demand for the course.&nbsp; Currently, the overhead involved in this
analysis is too high to perform for each class, each semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This document presents the requirements specification for the ICS Course
Approval System&nbsp; called Inca (an acronym for &quot;I Need Course
Approvals!!&quot;),
an automated system for improving the quality of course approval decisions and
decreasing the administrative overhead involved with making those decisions. The
basic idea of Inca is simple: students use a web browser to submit a self-prioritized list of course requests for the following semester. All of these
requests are collected in the system until a certain deadline date is
reached. Then, the system applies a set of rules to determine which requests are
filled, and builds a preliminary set of class lists for the following semester.
An ICS administrator then reviews this list and makes any modifications deemed
necessary. After approval by the administrator, the system automatically sends
email to all of the students simultaneously, informing each of them which of
their requested courses for which they have been approved, and the necessary CRN
or approval code.&nbsp; This process can be iterated at weekly or greater
intervals until the semester begins.&nbsp;</p>
