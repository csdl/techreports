<p>This section presents a set of usage scenarios that provide a sense for the
way the system interacts with students and administrators over the course of a
semester.&nbsp; The following scenarios include screen images along with links to
the actual page shown.&nbsp; These images have no graphical elegance, and are
intended to provide a simple illustration of the functionality of the
site.&nbsp; &nbsp; Note that in several cases, the contents of the page cannot
be displayed in a single screen image.&nbsp; In this case, you can follow the

<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"> Initial configuration by the
Inca administrator<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>It's October 15, and the ICS Inca administrator, Lei Wakayama, is ready to set up the
system for the upcoming semester.&nbsp; After checking with the ICS sysadmin to
see that the system is up and running, she goes to the Inca home page at <a href="http://courseapp.ics.hawaii.edu/">http://Inca.ics.hawaii.edu/admin</a>
and logs in:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec55.gif" width="369" height="338"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen21.htm">AdminLogin.jsp</a></p>
<p>The system is installed with a distinguished ID and password (which can be changed) for
the Inca administrator(s). After Lei logs in with her ID
and password, the following screen appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec68.gif" width="520" height="727"></p>
<p align="center"> <a href="screen09.htm">AdminMain.jsp</a></p>
<p align="left">Note that because this is the first time Lei has logged into
this system, and because no data for this semester has been uploaded, the site
status is relatively uninteresting.</p>
<p align="left">To configure the site for an upcoming registration season, Lei
needs to accomplish the following:</p>

    credit hours, and the total number of seats in each section.&nbsp; Lei clicks on the

    that file and uploads it into the system.&nbsp; (Note that a separate
    utility for defining these files will be created.&nbsp; This will allow us
    to define the course schedule for a semester in one file and use it for
    multiple purposes in the department.)<br>

    &quot;Upload student data&quot; link to go to a page where she specifies a
    file and uploads it into the system. (Note that this file is generated from
    ISIS data supplied to the department each semester.)&nbsp; Also note that, in
    general, information on students is accumulated over the semesters and is

    </i>Lei begins this process by using her personal records to determine which
    students are graduating seniors, and how many additional ICS courses they'll
    need to graduate this semester. She then uses&nbsp; the &quot;Edit student
    data&quot; link to add this information to the Inca database.&nbsp;<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
<!--msthemelist--></table>
<!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>At this point, Inca is ready to be opened to students.&nbsp; First,
however, Lei decides to check and make sure that the data she uploaded appears
to be correct.&nbsp; To do this, she generates two reports: one that shows the
set of courses defined for the Spring, 2000 semester using the
&quot;Courses&quot; link, and one that shows the set of defined students in the
system using the &quot;Students&quot; link. (Note that a student can become
defined within the system implicitly via an ISIS record, or explicitly via their
self-registration.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After sanity checking these reports, Lei uses the &quot;Update news&quot;
link to tell students on the front page when the site will close for approval
processing in November and when they can expect to receive the initial
approvals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, Lei uses the &quot;Toggle student logins&quot; link to enable student
access to the website, and sends a broadcast email to <a href="mailto:uhm-ics-students@hawaii.edu">uhm-ics-students@hawaii.edu</a>.&nbsp;
In this email, Lei tells students to check the ICS department website for
information about Spring, 2000 courses, then login to Inca to make their
requests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The day after Lei sends the broadcast email concerning Inca, Melissa Chow, a junior who is majoring in ICS,
reads it and decides to use the system.&nbsp; Melissa has already been to the
ICS department website to review the courses available for Spring, 2000, and has
decided that she wants to take ICS 491, 464, and 413 next semester.&nbsp; She
goes to the Inca website and the following login page now appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec56.gif" width="550" height="480"></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;<a href="screen01.htm">StudentLogin.jsp</a></p>
<p>Melissa has never used Inca before, so she clicks on the
&quot;register&quot; link and the following page appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec50.gif" width="523" height="692"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen02.htm">StudentRegistration.jsp</a></p>
<p>After filling in all the information and pressing submit, the following page
appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec35.gif" width="604" height="147"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen15.htm">ThanksForRegistering.jsp</a></p>
<p align="left">In a few minutes, Melissa checks her ITS account and finds an
automatically generated email from the Inca system confirming her
registration and supplying her with a password.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">

<h3><!--mstheme--><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica" color="#000000"> ICS Major request processing<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>Armed with her Inca password, Melissa Chow surfs back to the Inca login page, enters her student ID and password, and brings up the student main
page:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec39.gif" width="535" height="392"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen03.htm">StudentMain.jsp</a></p>
<p>The first thing Melissa does is check her records by clicking on the &quot;My
ICS status&quot; link.&nbsp; This brings up the following screen:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec36.gif" width="426" height="727"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen04.htm">StudentStatus.jsp</a></p>
<p>She confirms that all of this information is correct.&nbsp; Note that the
actual page contains additional text not shown in this image explaining what to
do if this information is incorrect, and links back to the main page and to
logout from Inca.</p>
<p>Melissa now goes back to the main page and selects &quot;Create/modify course
requests&quot;.&nbsp; The following page appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec28.gif" width="620" height="648"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen05.htm">CourseRequestQualified.jsp</a></p>
<p>This page is the heart of the Inca system.&nbsp; First, note that the
screen image above only shows a portion of the total page; in reality, Melissa
is also qualified for several other courses available during the Spring 2000
semester (ICS 413, 464, and 491) which are displayed below the entry for ICS
331.</p>
<p>Second, the information displayed with each course combines together useful
information from a variety of sources.&nbsp; The &quot;Course
Qualifications&quot; information is normally available from the Course
Catalog.&nbsp; The &quot;Sections&quot;, &quot;Corequisite Sections&quot;, and
&quot;Total seats&quot; information is normally available from Pa'e.&nbsp; The
&quot;Your situation&quot;, &quot;Current requests&quot;, and &quot;Current
approvals&quot; information is not usually available to students at all, but
provides very useful information to students on the state of registration and
their chances of getting into a section.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The &quot;Your situation&quot; row provides three crucial data items.&nbsp;
First, it specifies whether the student is qualified for the course in
question.&nbsp; The default mode for this page is to display only those courses
for which the student is qualified, so in the current example, this field will
always be &quot;yes&quot;.&nbsp; In a later scenario, you will see a situation
where the student displays all courses for the Spring semester. In this case,
when a student is not qualified for a course, this field describes how the
student failed to qualify for the course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second data item in the &quot;Your situation&quot; row specifies the
fine-grained priority value for Melissa Chow in ICS 331. In this example, it is
5.&nbsp; This value was computed using the fine-grained priority rule examples
in <a href="project-priorities.htm">Chapter 4</a>, and the only rule that
applied related to Melissa's GPA.&nbsp; This value is a link to a page that
essentially runs the rules in verbose mode, generating an explanation for how
the value was computed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third data item is perhaps the most controversial: it specifies, based
upon the fine-grained priority (and in the case of equal priorities, time of
request submission), the ranking of Melissa's request at this moment if she were
to request this course.&nbsp; In this example, Melissa's request would currently
be ranked 15th out of the 23 requests received so far.&nbsp; Since there are 45
seats to be allocated, this appears to give her a pretty good chance at this
course.&nbsp; However, if 30 students with higher fine-grained priorities
request this course between now and the time approvals are allocated, she would
fall to 46th in line and not receive an approval code, at least until the start
of the semester. Thus, the problem with providing this information is that it
might give some students a false sense of their chances for a course if they
submit their requests early.&nbsp; On the other hand, providing this information
gives those students who actively monitor their status almost real-time
information about their likely chances to obtain an approval code.&nbsp; This
has several expected benefits.&nbsp; First, it reduces student surprise when
they eventually receive the email informing them that their request has been
denied. Second, it allows students who discover that they have little chance of
obtaining an approval code for a course the chance to look for another course in
which they have better chances.&nbsp; This can improve overall student
satisfaction.&nbsp; Third, the use of fine-grained priority rules directly ties
a student's chances for course approval codes to things like their ICS GPA,
their lack of having withdrawn or failed prior ICS courses, their admittance
into the Honors program, and so forth.&nbsp; Creating a direct relationship
between these factors and their course selection priority creates an additional
incentive for students to excel in our program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Melissa scrolls through this page and specifies her first choice as ICS
491-1, second choice as ICS 464, and third choice as ICS 413.&nbsp; She
presses the &quot;Submit&quot; button at the bottom of the page and the
following page is returned as a result:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec29.gif" width="430" height="329"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen16.htm">CourseRequestConfirmation.jsp</a></p>
<p align="left">Melissa is interested to see how to delete requests, so she
clicks on the Student status page link in the above image.&nbsp; That retrieves
a new version of her student status page that includes data on her current set
of requests, as shown in the excerpt of her student status page below::</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec38.gif" width="533" height="355"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen04a.htm">StudentStatus.jsp</a></p>
<p align="left">Note that since her request has not yet been granted, neither
the section associated with a course nor the approval code is provided in this
table.&nbsp; Also, she did not exclude any sections from her requests so this
column is also blank.</p>
<p align="left">Melissa is satisfied with her course requests, so she logs out
of the Inca system.&nbsp; However, she does log back in once a week or so
just to check her ranking for her requests as the registration season
progresses.&nbsp; As more and more students submit requests, her ranking will
change, and she wants to make sure she still appears likely to get her course
requests.&nbsp;</p>

<!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">
</font>
<p>Lily Bender is a transferring student from the University of Washington who
has never enrolled in a course at UH before, but who has been admitted as a
transfer student and wants to register for courses starting in Spring
2000.&nbsp; In early November, she is surfing the ICS website and learns about
the Inca system. She goes to the home (login) page and learns she needs to
register first.&nbsp; After she visits the registration page, she learns that
she is a new student and needs to contact <a href="mailto:uhmics@hawaii.edu">uhmics@hawaii.edu</a>
in order to be manually registered in Inca.&nbsp; So, Lily sends an email
to uhmics explaining her situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lei reads the email&nbsp; and confirms that Lily is a transfer student.&nbsp;
She then obtains from Lily three important pieces of information:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Her UH Student ID (which in most cases is her SSN)&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Her email address</li>
  <li>Any courses at UWashington which would satisfy prereqs for ICS courses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once Lei obtains this information from Lily, she&nbsp; logs in to the Inca system as an administrator and clicks on the
&quot;Define New Student&quot; link.&nbsp; The following page appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec57.gif" width="548" height="467"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen22.htm">DefineNewStudent.jsp</a></p>
<p align="left">Lei fills out this form with Lily's first and last name, her
student ID, her University of Washington email address as her temporary email
until she can get an ITS account, and an initial password.&nbsp; She specifies
Lily as an undergrad, and since Lily faxed her transcript showing that she took
the introductory Java course at UW, Lei manually defines the ICS 111 course for
her.&nbsp; The results look like this:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec58.gif" width="548" height="467"></p>
<p align="left">After Lei presses &quot;Submit&quot;, this information is added
to the database and a confirmation page appears. Now that Lily is a registered Inca
user, the next step is for Lei to edit Lily's records to accurately
reflect her background.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">

</font>
<p align="left">It will occasionally happen that student records need to be
manually updated by the Inca administrator. For example, a student might be
accepted into the Honors Program and want to have that added to their records so
that their priority values for courses increase.&nbsp; Or, as in the case of our
transfer student named Lily Bender, she has taken the equivalent of ICS 111 at
the University of Washington and wants to have that information recorded so that
she is qualified to request an approval code for ICS 211.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">To edit student data, Lei goes to the Administrator Main Page
and clicks on the &quot;Edit Current Student&quot; link.&nbsp; This results in
the following page appearing:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec59.gif" width="550" height="234"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen23.htm">RetrieveStudent.jsp</a></p>
<p align="left">If she knows the student's ID, she can enter it to retrieve that
student's records.&nbsp; If not, she can click on the other button to generate a
list of all currently defined students (first and last name and student
ID).&nbsp; By each student's name is a button that can be used to retrieve that
student's data for editing.&nbsp; In this scenario, Lei wants to edit Lily
Bender's data, and she knows her student ID because she just entered it, so she
types in &quot;456234123&quot;, presses &quot;Retrieve ID data&quot;, and the
following page appears:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec60.gif" width="551" height="739"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen24.htm">EditStudent.jsp</a></p>
<p align="left">This page contains four sections: basic data, course history,
requests and approvals, and consents. It lists data concerning that student for
each category of information, along with a button that allows the administrator
to edit information pertaining to that section. Lei clicks on &quot;Edit ICS
Course History Information&quot; which brings up the following page:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec67.gif" width="562" height="579"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen25.htm">EditStudentCourseHistory.jsp</a></p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">This page allows Lei to enter up to seven new courses for Lily
Bender.&nbsp; Note that had Lily been a continuing student, the courses she had
already taken would have been displayed along with the option to delete
them.&nbsp; Lei changes the first row to indicate that Lily has taken ICS 111
and received a grade of B in Fall, 1998.&nbsp; In the comment field, Lei enters
&quot;UWash&quot; so that future administrators will know where this course came
from.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">In order to modify existing course info using this form, Lei
must &quot;delete&quot; the existing course and simultaneously define a new one
with the modified information.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Lily can now login to Inca from Washington.&nbsp; Since her
record will show ICS 111 as having been taken with a B, she will be qualified to
request ICS 141, ICS 211, and ICS 464.&nbsp;&nbsp; Since she is a new student,
her request is automatically placed at the end of the line, behind all
continuing students, and it will be early January before she learns whether or
not she will receive an approval code. Note that the situation is not quite as
dire as it might appear, since only 50% of the seats in ICS 211 will be
allocated before January.</p>

<p>On November 21, Lei logs back in to the Inca system as administrator to
begin the approval allocation process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She begins at the Administrator main page where she clicks on the &quot;Toggle student logins&quot; link, which
disables all further access to site by students who have not yet logged in.
Those who are currently logged in can finish their activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, she clicks on the &quot;Edit News&quot; link to replace the Inca home (login) page news message with one that says that the
Inca system is
closed to students for the next several hours for initial approval
allocation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, she looks at the Site Status table, and sees that two students are
currently logged in. She waits 30 minutes, then presses the &quot;Refresh&quot;
button to refresh the site status data, and finds that the students are now
logged out.&nbsp; Now she can begin looking at the set of requests without
worrying about whether or not additional students will make requests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the site is closed to students, Lei begins by the new approval
allocation process by clicking on the
&quot;Allocate new approvals&quot; link from the Administrator Main Page. This brings
up an initial page called &quot;Set Allocation Policy&quot; that includes a list
of all the courses.&nbsp; For each course, the pages lists the number of total
seats in the course across all sections, the total number of requests, the total
number of approvals allocated thus far, the number of seats that would remain if
all approvals resulted in a registration events, and&nbsp; an &quot;allocation&quot;&nbsp; field in which Lei can enter an integer
indicating the number of new approval codes to allocate for each course.&nbsp; This
can be any non-negative integer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> For example, if there are 20 seats
in the course, and 10 current requests, then an allocation of 5 indicates that
the five top-ranked requests should be emailed an approval code. An allocation
of 0 indicates that none should get an approval code at this time.&nbsp; An
allocation of 15 indicates that all 10 requests should be satisfied (it is legal
but uninteresting to have an allocation higher than the number of requests,
which results in one approval for all current requests).&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is a
section of that page:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec42.gif" width="522" height="347"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen19.htm">SetAllocation.jsp</a></p>
<p>Lei specifies &quot;New Approvals&quot; for around half of the seats in the intro courses, and three
quarters of the seats in the 300 and 400 level courses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, Lei clicks on the &quot;Allocate Approvals To Students&quot; button at
the bottom of the Set Allocation Policy page.&nbsp; This takes her to a new page
organized into two parts.&nbsp; The first part is organized by course,
and lists a course name followed by all of the requests for that course.&nbsp;
The requests are ordered by priority, and&nbsp; include the student name,
priority value, and a checkbox. The checkbox is checked by default if the
student's request will be given an approval based upon their priority value and
the number of approvals to be allocated.&nbsp; It is unchecked by default if the
request will not get an approval value based upon the request's priority value
and the number of approvals to be allocated.&nbsp;&nbsp; The following page
illustrates the first part of the page:</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec63.gif" width="581" height="336"></p>
<p align="center"><a href="screen26.htm">AllocateNewApprovals.jsp</a></p>
<p>This page's contents results from the administrator having set the approval
allocation at 5 for ICS 313, and there being 12 outstanding requests for this
course.&nbsp; In this case, the top five requests are checked, indicating that
if the allocation was submitted without any changes, these students would be
emailed an approval code for this course. Each entry includes a checkmark, a
bracketed number indicating the priority value obtained by this student for this
course, the student's name, and the student's ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order for Lei to make sure that this is a reasonable set of approvals, she
may want to look at the current state of requests and approvals organized by
student.&nbsp; The second part of the page contains this report. It&nbsp; lists each student
who has submitted one or more requests and the courses they have
requested.&nbsp; If, based upon the automatic allocation, the student is going
to receive an approval for the course requested, the course is listed in
green.&nbsp; If not, the course is listed in red. If the student has already
received an approval for a course, it is listed in black.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="projec65.gif" width="589" height="259"></p>
<p>&nbsp;Lei uses this list to attempt to ensure that, for example, every student will get at least one ICS course.&nbsp; If Lei
discovers students who really need a course but have not gotten it (or have
gotten a course they shouldn't), then she can go back to the first part of the
report and check (or uncheck) the box associated with that particular
request.&nbsp; Manually checking or unchecking the box overrules the default
allocation algorithm.&nbsp; In this case, she might review Stuart Etheridge's
situation, since he is not getting any courses at all so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Lei is satisfied that the allocations look good, she can press
&quot;Submit&quot; at the bottom of the page.&nbsp; This generates emails to
every student with a course request, indicating its current status.&nbsp; Those
who got an approval will have the approval code listed next to the
request.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having finished with initial allocations, Lei reopens the site for further
course requests by students.&nbsp;</p>
