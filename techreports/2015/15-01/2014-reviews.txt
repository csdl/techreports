Panel Summary 
-------------
Overall rating: low competitive. Individual Ratings:  VG, VG/G, G/F, F. 

The PIs propose to design, implement, and deploy a low-cost hardware/software platform to record power quality in homes. The PIs plan to evaluate their system by deploying it in 150 homes in Hawaii, performing a user study to obtain feedback on how low power quality affects end-users, and then making recommendations to users on how to address any power quality issues. 

Intellectual Merit: 
Strengths: 
+ Gathering data from a real prototype implementation in 150 homes in Hawaii may produce interesting data, given Hawaii's high solar penetration. 
+ Crowd-sourced approach that increases end-user awareness of power quality is interesting. 
Weaknesses: 
- There is no preliminary evidence of how power quality currently affects Hawaiian residents. 
- The hardware/software system for data collection is incremental and does not advance computing or cyberinfrastructure. 

Broader Impacts: 
Strengths: 
+ The public release of hardware specifications, software, and data may be of value to the community. 
+ The project would benefit Hawaii's under-represented student population. 
Weaknesses: 
- The education and outreach component could be more detailed. 

Program Specific Requirements: 
Strengths: 
+ The team is cross-disciplinary and experienced to carry out the research. 
+ Raising awareness of end-users to power issues is important for sustainability. 
Weaknesses: 
- The proposal does not adequately address how their approach advances computing or cyberinfrastructure.

-----------------------------

* [4] The creation of a new, open-sourced data set focused on power quality would definitely potentially create new insights into the impact of such reporting on consumer behavior.
* [4] The idea of an open-source hardware/software community is highly appealing.
* [3] The data management plan is adequate.
* [2] The team is well established and highly cross-disciplinary. The resulting research will not only require, but potentially impact studies in multiple fields.
* [2] Objectives are clearly laid out.
* [2] The PIs have the prior expertise to carry out the plan.
* [2] The use of very low cost hardware to perform the study is a novel contribution. Clearly a big deterrent to the success of such crowdsourcing-based studies in the past has been the cost of installing frequency/phase measurement hardware.
* [1] The proposed plan is clear and concrete. 
* [1] There is a preliminary hardware design that they will build off of. 
* [1] Research will benefit Hawaii's large population of under-represented students.
* [1] The proposal examines how end-users react (and change behavior) based on knowledge of their power quality and their neighbor's power quality. 
* [1] Real-world implementation in 150 homes in Hawaii is an ideal testbed for data collection. 
* [1] Potential for commercialization is an obvious plus.
* [1] Insights into power quality for consumers could shift the entire debate around demand-response in a positive direction and influence the inclusion of renewable in the grid. 
* [1] The results could have a major impact on how sustainable practices, particularly solar integration, are viewed with regards to power quality in US homes and if information regarding power quality has any impact on behavior. 
* [1] The use of crowdsourcing electricity quality data as a modality of engaging users in the smarter grid is a novel and interesting idea. Most studies in the past has focussed on energy consumption and awareness towards residential energy consumption as the mode of engaging users in the smarter grid, which has produced limited success. 
* [1] The broader impact plan is well laid out and explained. Though fairly standard, the broader impact section presents the societal impact aspect well. 


Weaknesses from individual reviews. (Number in brackets indicates how many reviewers voiced the comment)
-----------------------------

* [4] The research is oriented around a practical deployment and does not make fundamental contributions to computer and information science/engineering. The hardware for measuring frequency/phase is pretty standard. Challenges such as noise in the collected data is not discussed. It is very difficult to gauge the novelty in the hardware design that makes the deployed hardware low cost yet robust. Similarly, performing surveys and interview are standard usability methods and a web interface to visualize data is off-the-shelf. The proposal can be strengthened through some initial data collection and analysis.
* [4] The only doubt is the willingness and sustainability of the customers participation in regard to the power quality issue, like any other customer's participation project in energy usage. Their interest may fade over the time. What is the plan if consumers are unwilling to participate?
* [3] The PIs do not have any preliminary data suggesting the current (or future) impact of low power quality. Do users currently notice power quality issues in Hawaii? What is the impact of the current levels of low power quality? How will these impacts get worse with increased solar penetration? I realize one purpose of the study is to gather data in support of these questions; however, it seems that the PIs could gather some initial anecdotal data to motivate their study. While crowdsourcing electricity quality data is a novel modality to engage a user in the smart grid, without some evidence that this will actually work, the proposed outcomes is completely a speculation. Most of the arguments made in the paper are conjectures. Similar arguments were and are being made with respect to increasing consumer participation in understanding energy consumption which have been unsuccessful in the past, as the PIs point out. 
* [1] It is not clear from the proposal what tasks are assigned to which PI, and how the project leverages the expertise of each individual PI. 
* [1] Letters of support from anyone are not present. This could have included utilities or consumers in Hawaii or the three organizations mentioned in terms of collaboration (Kanu Hawaii, Blue Planet Foundation, and Kokua Foundation) 
* [1] Is the proposed software/hardware community sustainable in the long run? 
* [1] There are some minor details that would make the research methodology clearer. For instance, how do you plan to monitor the number of calls made to the utility company. More details on the underlying fusion algorithm that combines environmental data with electricity quality data could be provided. Although the contribution might not be in the specific algorithm that would be used, it will help understand the types of correlations that the PIs want to infer from these varied data sources. 
* [1] There is no education or outreach plan. 
* [1] The data isn't really crowd-sourced, since you are coordinating the installation of the devices. It would be crowd-sourced if people were independently installing your device (or other equivalent devices) and voluntarily uploading their data to you.
