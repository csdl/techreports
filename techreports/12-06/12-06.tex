% THIS IS ICT4S_PROC.TEX - VERSION 1.0 based on SIGPROC_SP.TEX (ACM SIG Proceedings Latex format)
% WORKS WITH V1 OF ICT4S_PROC_ARTICLE.CLS based on ACM_PROC_ARTICLE_SP.CLS V3.2SP
% August 2012
%
% It is an example file showing how to format the full paper for the ICT4S 2013 conference proceedings
%
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
%
% For tracking purposes - this is based on sigproc-sp V3.1SP - APRIL 2009


% NOTE ON THE DIFFERENCES:
% We have slightly tweaked the .cls and the .tex to allow a result similar to the 
% Word template provided for the ICT4S 2013.
% Authors:
% - below the title the authors are given as a centered list with footnote-like 
%   marks pointing to affiliations  (use \amarks{<number>} )
% - below the list of authors follows a list of addresses 
%     *each starting on a new line
%     *explaining one of the marks used in the list of authors
% - each address consists of the affiliation followed by the email addresses of the
%   authors belonging to the affiliation, an empty line before each affiliation
% - One email per author suffices
