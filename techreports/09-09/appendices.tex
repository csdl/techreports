\section{Interview procedure}
By the beginning of the Fall'09 semester, I plan to design a taxonomy and implement a low-level software process events abstraction into symbolic representation. The database schema will be extended for storing these data and indexes. Immediately after that, I will proceed with the implementation of fundamental algorithms for associated and sequential patterns mining. This new data model and KDD toolkit will allow me to discover more low-level behavior patterns some of which might be found useful though the empirical evaluation during the period of data collection from the Fall'09 Software engineering class. I will be working with those students who will demonstrate a relevant recurrent behavior in software process for clarification of observed phenomena.
