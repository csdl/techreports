\section{Experimental design} \label{survey}
I plan to conduct at least two classroom surveys evaluating both: the performance of the Software Trajectory framework and the usfullness of discovered patterns. This surveys will be conducted under approved by Committee on Human Subjects application: \textit{CHS \#16520 - Evaluation of Hackystat}.

The approach I am taking in this study design resembles a Software Project Telemtery system evaluation performed by Qin Zhang in \cite{csdl2-06-05}. As pointed by Zhang, the choice of anonymous survey format when collecting feedback in a classroom is more advantegeous then interview. It eliminates student concerns about final grades and provides less biased feedback. The fixed and limited questionaire is the only disadvantage of survey. 


The survey format is chosen interview format during my work on the TrBy the beginning of the Fall'09 semester, I plan to design a taxonomy and implement a low-level software process events abstraction into symbolic representation. The database schema will be extended for storing these data and indexes. Immediately after that, I will proceed with the implementation of fundamental algorithms for associated and sequential patterns mining. This new data model and KDD toolkit will allow me to discover more low-level behavior patterns some of which might be found useful though the empirical evaluation during the period of data collection from the Fall'09 Software engineering class. I will be working with those students who will demonstrate a relevant recurrent behavior in software process for clarification of observed phenomena.
