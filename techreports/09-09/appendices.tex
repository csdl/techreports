\section{Estimated Timeline}
By the beginning of the Fall'09 semester, I plan to design a taxonomy and implement a low-level software process events abstraction into symbolic representation. The database schema will be extended for storing these data and indexes. Immediately after that, I will proceed with the implementation of fundamental algorithms for associated and sequential patterns mining. This new data model and KDD toolkit will allow me to discover more low-level behavior patterns some of which might be found useful though the empirical evaluation during the period of data collection from the Fall'09 Software engineering class. I will be working with those students who will demonstrate a relevant recurrent behavior in software process for clarification of observed phenomena.

By the end of the Spring'10 semester I am planning to finish all of my experiments and software system implementation, and will move on to a peer-reviewed publication and the dissertation thesis defense.

While individual telemetry streams (panel $b$, left three plots for each stream represent raw data, right three plots - Z-normalized data) show different data distributions, the combined and normalized data (panel $a$) close to the normal distribution. Combined data was used for creation of the \textit{Universal Telemetry SAX alphabet}.}
