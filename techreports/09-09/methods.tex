\chapter{Methods}
This chapter discusses relevant to the research methods. The Piecewise Aggregate Approximation (\ref{paa}) and Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (\ref{sax}) sections explain the aproach taken for conversion of Hackystat telemetry streams into \textit{symbolic sequences}. Note, that all of the following methods assume \textbf{symbolic sequences as default}.
	The Temporal Concepts section (\ref{tconcepts}) introduces concepts of ``\textit{event}'' and ``\textit{interval}'' on the symbolic sequences along with a set of applicable \textit{temporal operators}. 
	The last section, Temporal patterns  and indexing (\ref{tpatterns}) introduces definition of ``\textit{motif}'' and ``\textit{surprise}'' patterns along with discussing relevant pattern search algorithms and data structures used for patterns indexing.
