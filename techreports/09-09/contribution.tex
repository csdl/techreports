\chapter{Anticipated contribution} \label{contribution}
As the main contribution of my research to the software engineering and especially software process community I am envisioning development of a previously unexplored approach of discovering recurrent behaviors in software process through data mining of low-level process and product artifacts.

The results of the experimental work, and evaluation of the approach taken, will be another contribution of my research. By performing these, I am expecting to discover unknown patterns in the software process, improving our knowledge about it.

The software framework and data mining toolkit which I will develop for my research will be integrated with existing family of Hackystat tools contributing software-engineering community.
