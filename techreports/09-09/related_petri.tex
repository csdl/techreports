\section{Incremental Workflow Mining with Petri Nets}
Another set of findings relevant to my research approach was developed by Rubin et al. \cite{citeulike:1885717} and van der Aalst et al \cite{citeulike:3718014} and is called \textit{incremental workflow mining}. The authors not only designed sophisticated algorithms but built a software system using a business process mining framework called ProM by van Dongen et al. \cite{citeulike:5043673} which synthesizes a Petri Net corresponding to the observed process. The system was tested on SCM logs and while the process artifacts retrieved from the SCM system are rather high-level, the approach discussed is very promising for the modeling of software processes from the low-level product and process data.

Within the incremental workflow mining framework, the input data from the SCM audit trail information is mapped to the event chain which corresponds to the software process artifacts. The authors call this process \textit{abstraction on the log level} which is implemented as a set of filters which not only aggregates basic events into single high-level entities but also removes data irrelevant to the mining process (noise). 

The event chain constructed through the abstraction is then treated with the \textit{Generate} part of the \textit{``Generate and Synthesis''} \cite{citeulike:3718014} algorithm in order to generate a \textit{Transition System} which represents an ordered series of events. This algorithm looks at the history (prefix) and the future (suffix) sequences of events related to the current one in order to discover transitions.  When applied to the abstracted log information, the algorithm generates a rather large Transition System graph where edges connect to abstracted events. This transition system is then successively simplified by using various reduction strategies such as ``Kill Loops'', ``Extend'', ``Merge by Output'' and others; it is possible to combine these reduction strategies in order to achieve a greater simplification.

At the last step of the incremental workflow mining approach, Transition Systems are used to \textit{Synthesize} labeled Petri nets (where different transition can refer to the same event) with the help of \textit{``regions theory''} \cite{citeulike:5128170}. As with the Transition System generation, the authors investigate many different strategies of Petri nets synthesis, showing significant variability in the results achieved. (see Figure \ref{fig:petri}).

The significant contribution of this research is in the generality of the method. It was shown that by tuning the ``Generate'' and ``Synthesize'' phases it is possible to tailor the algorithm to a wide variety of processes. In particular, as mentioned before, Rubin et al. successfully applied this framework to the SCM logs analysis.
