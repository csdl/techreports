    abstract = {It has long been known that Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) is superior to Euclidean distance for classification and clustering of time series. However, until lately, most research has utilized Euclidean distance because it is more efficiently calculated. A recently introduced technique that greatly mitigates {DTWs} demanding {CPU} time has sparked a flurry of research activity. However, the technique and its many extensions still only allow {DTW} to be applied to moderately large datasets. In addition, almost all of the research on {DTW} has focused exclusively on speeding up its calculation; there has been little work done on improving its accuracy. In this work, we target the accuracy aspect of {DTW} performance and introduce a new framework that learns arbitrary constraints on the warping path of the {DTW} calculation. Apart from improving the accuracy of classification, our technique as a side effect speeds up {DTW} by a wide margin as well. We show the utility of our approach on datasets 
from diverse domains and demonstrate significant gains in accuracy and efficiency.},

    abstract = {. We propose an indexing method for time sequences for processing similarity queries. We use the Discrete Fourier Transform ({DFT}) to map time sequences to the frequency domain, the crucial observation being that, for most sequences of practical interest, only the first few frequencies are strong. Another important observation is Parseval's theorem, which specifies that the Fourier transform preserves the Euclidean distance in the time or frequency domain. Having thus mapped sequences to a lowerdimensionality space by using only the first few Fourier coefficients, we use R    - trees to index the sequences and efficiently answer similarity queries. We provide experimental results which show that our method is superior to search based on sequential scanning. Our experiments show that a few coefficients (1-3) are adequate to provide good performance. The performance gain of our method increases with the number and length of sequences.

In this work, we show how a novel multiresolution symbolic representation can be used to index datasets which are several orders of magnitude larger than anything else considered in the literature. Our approach allows both fast exact search and ultra fast approximate search. We show how to exploit the combination of both types of search as sub-routines in data mining algorithms, allowing for the exact mining of truly massive real world datasets, containing millions of time series.},

Previous human activity recognition techniques use a "whole-motion" model in which continuous sensor streams are divided into windows with a fixed time duration whose length is chosen such that all the relevant information in each activity signal can be extracted from each window. In this paper, we present a statistical motion primitive-based framework for human activity representation and recognition. Our framework is based on {Bag-of-Features} ({BoF}), which builds activity models using histograms of primitive symbols. We experimentally validate the effectiveness the {BoF}-based framework for recognizing nine activity classes and evaluate six factors which impact the performance of the framework. The factors include window size, choices of features, methods to construct motion primitives, 
motion vocabulary size, weighting schemes of motion primitive assignments, and learning machine kernel functions. Finally, we demonstrate that our statistical {BoF}-based framework can achieve much better performance compared to a non-statistical string-matching-based approach.},

Numerous representation methods for dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have been introduced. Each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive set of time series experiments re-implementing 8 different representation methods and 9 similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these 
different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Our experiments have provided both a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, and in some cases, suggested that certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.},

    abstract = {Time series shapelets are small, local patterns in a time series that are highly predictive of a class and are thus very useful features for building classifiers and for certain visualization and summarization tasks. While shapelets were introduced only recently, they have already seen significant adoption and extension in the community. Despite their immense potential as a data mining primitive, there are two important limitations of shapelets. First, their expressiveness is limited to simple binary presence/absence questions. Second, even though shapelets are computed offline, the time taken to compute them is significant. In this work, we address the latter problem by introducing a novel algorithm that finds shapelets in less time than current methods by an order of magnitude. Our algorithm is based on intelligent caching and reuse of computations, and the admissible pruning of the search space. Because our algorithm is so fast, it creates an opportunity to consider more expressive 
shapelet queries. In particular, we show for the first time an augmented shapelet representation that distinguishes the data based on conjunctions or disjunctions of shapelets. We call our novel representation {Logical-Shapelets}. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on the classic benchmark datasets used for these problems, and show several case studies where logical shapelets significantly outperform the original shapelet representation and other time series classification techniques. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas in domains as diverse as gesture recognition, robotics, and biometrics.},

    abstract = {In this paper, we propose a retrieval method using textual information retrieval techniques, such as vector space model, for images. Many image retrieval systems are proposed. However, these systems are mainly based on pattern recognition techniques. Therefore, the features of images are also based on these recognition techniques, such as color histogram, and shape of the object in images. Generally, these systems do not consider weight of features, which means how important these features are, which are generally used in textual information retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose a method considering weight, such as {TFIDF}, to identify the importance degree of features. Using our proposed method, the system can retrieve intuitively similar retrieval target images to user's query images.},

    abstract = {Comparison of different metrics, using three large samples of haplotypes from different populations, demonstrates that ρ is the most efficient measure of association between pairs of single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}). Pairwise data can be modeled, using composite likelihood, to describe the decline in linkage disequilibrium with distance (the Malecot model). The evidence from more isolated populations (Finland, Sardinia) suggests that linkage disequilibrium extends to 427–893 kb but, even in samples representative of large heterogeneous populations, such as {CEPH}, the extent is 385 kb or greater. This suggests that isolated populations are not essential for linkage disequilibrium mapping of common diseases with {SNPs}. The ∈ parameter of the Malecot model (recombination and time), evaluated at each {SNP}, indicates regions of the genome with extensive and less extensive disequilibrium (low and high values of ∈ respectively). When plotted against the physical map, the regions with 
extensive and less extensive linkage disequilibrium may correspond to recombination cold and hot spots. This is discussed in relation to the Xq25 cytogenetic band and the {HFE} gene region. Hum Mutat 17:255–262, 2001. {\copyright} 2001 {Wiley-Liss}, Inc.},

                Exome sequencing using next-generation sequencing technologies is a cost efficient approach to selectively sequencing coding regions of human genome for detection of disease variants. A significant amount of {DNA} fragments from the capture process fall outside target regions, and sequence data for positions outside target regions have been mostly ignored after alignment.
                We performed whole exome sequencing on 22 subjects using Agilent {SureSelect} capture reagent and 6 subjects using Illumina {TrueSeq} capture reagent. We also downloaded sequencing data for 6 subjects from the 1000 Genomes Project Pilot 3 study. Using these data, we examined the quality of {SNPs} detected outside target regions by computing consistency rate with genotypes obtained from {SNP} chips or the Hapmap database, transition-transversion ({Ti/Tv}) ratio, and percentage of {SNPs} inside {dbSNP}. For all three platforms, we obtained high-quality {SNPs} outside target regions, and some far from target regions. In our Agilent {SureSelect} data, we obtained 84,049 high-quality {SNPs} outside target regions compared to 65,231 {SNPs} inside target regions (a 129\% increase). For our Illumina {TrueSeq} data, we obtained 222,171 high-quality {SNPs} outside target regions compared to 95,818 {SNPs} inside target regions (a 232\% increase). For the data from the 1000 Genomes Project, we obtained 7,
139 high-quality {SNPs} outside target regions compared to 1,548 {SNPs} inside target regions (a 461\% increase).
                These results demonstrate that a significant amount of high quality genotypes outside target regions can be obtained from exome sequencing data. These data should not be ignored in genetic epidemiology studies.

    abstract = {The transcriptome of a cell is represented by a myriad of different {RNA} molecules with and without protein-coding capacities. In recent years, advances in sequencing technologies have allowed researchers to more fully appreciate the complexity of whole transcriptomes, showing that the vast majority of the genome is transcribed, producing a diverse population of non-protein coding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}). Thus, the biological significance of non-coding {RNAs} ({ncRNAs}) have been largely underestimated. Amongst these multiple classes of {ncRNAs}, the long non-coding {RNAs} ({lncRNAs}) are apparently the most numerous and functionally diverse. A small but growing number of {lncRNAs} have been experimentally studied, and a view is emerging that these are key regulators of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian cells. {LncRNAs} have already been implicated in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration, highlighting the importance of this emergent field. In this article, we review the 
catalogs of annotated {lncRNAs} and the latest advances in our understanding of {lncRNAs}.},

                Transcriptional initiation of each gene is assumed to be independently controlled in mammals. On the other hand, recent large-scale transcriptome analyses have shown that the genome is pervasively transcribed, such that the most of its {DNA} gives rise to {RNAs}. This raises the question of whether it is possible to pinpoint and activate a particular locus without perturbing numerous neighbouring transcripts. Here we show that intensive transcription at one locus frequently spills over into its physical neighbouring loci. Rapid induction of immediate-early genes ({IEGs}) in response to growth factor stimulations is accompanied by co-upregulation of their neighbouring genes. Profiling the primary transcripts in the nucleus with whole-genome tiling arrays delineated simultaneous activation of transcription centred on {IEGs}. Even in surrounding intergenic regions, transcriptional activation took place at the same time. Acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 are elevated along with the {IEG} 
induction and neighbouring co-upregulation. Inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) pathway or the transcription factor {SRF} suppresses all transcriptional upregulation. These results suggest that transcriptional activation has a ripple effect, which may be advantageous for coordinated expression.

It is suggested to approach this problem not only via location\&\#8211;space or attribute\&\#8211;space as is traditionally done in {GIScience}, but also via time\&\#8211;space. This time-visualisation approach considers the data, the user tasks and the visualisation representations, and aims to improve accessibility, exploration and analysis of huge amounts of geo-data to support geovisual analytics. To reach this objective, the time wave as the temporal visual representation is introduced. The time wave combines the strengths of both the timeline and the time wheel and as such is able to represent linear and cyclic time simultaneously, even at different levels of granularity. The time wave can be used in its role as temporal reference system, as temporal data representation tool, and as temporal interaction tool. It functions

    abstract = {Summary form only given. Many masters-level programs have been created to address the need for more professional software engineers. A question remains, however, as to the place for software engineering in undergraduate studies. To date, most work in undergraduate software engineering education has been performed by small clusters of computer science and engineering faculty, widely dispersed throughout academia. Building on recommendations from the Software Engineering Institute ({SEI}), the Association for Computing Machinery ({ACM}), and the {IEEE} Computer Society, these initial efforts have begun to bear fruit. Typically, the result is a set of software engineering courses arranged according to one of the following formats: (a) an elective or required course sequence; (b) elective noncredit paracticums; and (c) software engineering topics introduced in existing courses. The paper discusses: (a) What is the proper relationship between typical engineering programs and those in software 
engineering? (b) How should software engineering education differ from both computer science and computer engineering? (c) If undergraduate program degrees in software engineering are developed, how should such programs interact with other engineering programs? and (d) How are minors and concentrations in software engineering affected by the presence of a baccalaureate in software engineering?},

These companies seek to benefit from the talent of a global and sometimes voluntary workforce by paying some employees to contribute to {OSS} projects. This merging of open and traditional software development may cause developer stress based on conflicting {OSS} community and traditional software development norms. Specifically, developers must balance company intellectual property concerns with the reciprocal and community-based norms that drive {OSS} development. When these values are not in sync, contributors that aim to abide by conflicting values may exhibit dysfunctional attitudes. Employee stress with respect to their role can be destructive to organizational outcomes. This study develops an {OSS} context specific model that describes the relationship between clashing software development 
cultures and employee organizational commitment. We leverage the rich {OSS} literature and the research that focuses on organizational-professional conflict ({OPC}) to develop hypotheses linking clashing cultures and organizational commitment.

({MSR}) researchers deal with a problem of discovery of interesting and actionable information about software projects. It is
a common practice to perform analyzes on the various levels
of abstraction of change events, for example by aggregating
change-events into time-series. Following this, I investigate
the applicability of {SAX}-based approximation and indexing of
time-series with tf∗idf weights in order to discover recurrent
behaviors within development process. The proposed workﬂow
starts by extracting and aggregating of revision control data
and followed by reduction and transformation of aggregated
data into symbolic space with {PAA} and {SAX}. Resulting {SAX}
words then grouped into dictionaries associated with software
process constraints known to inﬂuence behaviors, such as time,
location, employment, etc. These, in turn, are investigated with
the use of tf∗idf statistics as a dissimilarity measure in order
to discover behavioral patterns.
As a proof of the concept I have applied this technique to
software process artifact trails corresponding to Android {OS}
development, where it was able to discover recurrent behaviors
in the  ” new code lines dynamics” before and after release.
By building a classiﬁer upon these behaviors, I was able to
successfully recognize pre- and post-release behaviors within
the same and similar sub-projects of Android {OS}.},

It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning. The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing, in particular, that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure. Exhaustivity and specificity We are familiar with the notions of exhaustivity and specificity: exhaustivity is a property of index descriptions, and specificity one of index terms. They are most clearly illustrated by a simple keyword or 
descriptor system. In this case the exhaustivity of a document description is the coverage of its various topics given by the terms assigned to it; and the specificity of an individual term is the level of detail at which a given concept is represented.},

    abstract = {Previous taxonomies of software change have focused on the purpose of the change (i.e., the why) rather than the underlying mechanisms. This paper proposes a taxonomy of software change based on characterizing the mechanisms of change and the factors that influence these mechanisms. The ultimate goal of this taxonomy is to provide a framework that positions concrete tools, formalisms and methods within the domain of software evolution. Such a framework would considerably ease comparison between the various mechanisms of change. It would also allow practitioners to identify and evaluate the relevant tools, methods and formalisms for a particular change scenario. As an initial step towards this taxonomy, the paper presents a framework that can be used to characterize software change support tools and to identify the factors that impact on the use of these tools. The framework is evaluated by applying it to three different change support tools and by comparing these tools based on this analysis.

Recently, it has been applied in text mining such as document categorization, clustering, etc. In this paper, we conduct a study on text clustering using frequent itemsets. The main contribution of this paper is three manifolds. First, we present a review on existing methods of document clustering using frequent patterns. Second, a new method called Maximum Capturing is proposed for document clustering. Maximum Capturing includes two procedures: constructing document clusters and assigning cluster topics. We develop three versions of Maximum Capturing based on three similarity measures. We propose a normalization process based on frequency sensitive competitive learning for Maximum Capturing to merge cluster candidates into predefined number of clusters. Third, experiments are carried out to evaluate the proposed method in comparison with {CFWS}, {CMS}, {FTC} and {FIHC} methods. Experiment results show that in clustering, Maximum 
Capturing has better performances than other methods mentioned above. Particularly, Maximum Capturing with representation using individual words and similarity measure using asymmetrical binary similarity achieves the best performance. Moreover, topics produced by Maximum Capturing distinguished clusters from each other and can be used as labels of document clusters.},

    abstract = {Most of existing text clustering algorithms use the vector space model, which treats documents as bags of words. Thus, word sequences in the documents are ignored, while the meaning of natural languages strongly depends on them. In this paper, we propose two new text clustering algorithms, named Clustering based on Frequent Word Sequences ({CFWS}) and Clustering based on Frequent Word Meaning Sequences ({CFWMS}). A word is the word form showing in the document, and a word meaning is the concept expressed by synonymous word forms. A word (meaning) sequence is frequent if it occurs in more than certain percentage of the documents in the text database. The frequent word (meaning) sequences can provide compact and valuable information about those text documents. For experiments, we used the Reuters-21578 text collection, {CISI} documents of the Classic data set [Classic data set, ftp://ftp.cs.cornell.edu/pub/smart/], and a corpus of the Text Retrieval Conference ({TREC}) [High Accuracy Retrieval 
from Documents ({HARD}) Track of Text Retrieval Conference, 2004]. Our experimental results show that {CFWS} and {CFWMS} have much better clustering accuracy than Bisecting k-means ({BKM}) [M.

Most of these algorithms rely on pre-building an index (such as a trie) for subsequences. Users of these algorithms are typically required to choose optimal values for word-length and/or alphabet-size parameters of the index, which are not intuitive. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to directly search for the {top-K} discords, without the requirement of building an index or tuning external parameters. The algorithm exploits quasi-periodicity present in many time series. For quasi-periodic time series, the algorithm gains significant speedup by reducing the number of calls to the distance function.},

We present a Monte Carlo heuristic, based on randomized hill-climbing, for approximating the optimal weight tree, given the quartet topology weights. The method repeatedly transforms a dendrogram, with all objects involved as leaves, achieving a monotonic approximation to the exact single globally optimal tree. The problem and the solution heuristic has been extensively used for general hierarchical clustering of nontree-like (non-phylogeny) data in various domains and across domains with heterogeneous data. We also present a greatly improved heuristic, reducing the running time by a factor of order a thousand to ten thousand. All this is implemented and available, as part of the {

    abstract = {Words and phrases acquire meaning from the way they are used in society, from their relative semantics to other words and phrases. For computers, the equivalent of "society" is "database," and the equivalent of "use" is "a way to search the database". We present a new theory of similarity between words and phrases based on information distance and Kolmogorov complexity. To fix thoughts, we use the World Wide Web ({WWW}) as the database, and Google as the search engine. The method is also applicable to other search engines and databases. This theory is then applied to construct a method to automatically extract similarity, the Google similarity distance, of words and phrases from the {WWW} using Google page counts. The {WWW} is the largest database on earth, and the context information entered by millions of independent users averages out to provide automatic semantics of useful quality. We give applications in hierarchical clustering, classification, and language translation. We give examples 
to distinguish between colors and numbers, cluster names of paintings by 17th century Dutch masters and names of books by English novelists, the ability to understand emergencies and primes, and we demonstrate the ability to do a simple automatic {English-Spanish} translation. Finally, we use the {WordNet} database as an objective baseline against which to judge the performance of our method. We conduct a massive randomized trial in binary classification using support vector machines to learn categories based on our Google distance, resulting in an a mean agreement of 87 percent with the expert crafted {WordNet} categories},

Symbolic representations have proven to be a very effective way to reduce the dimensionality of time series even using simple aggregations over episodes of the same length and a fixed set of symbols. However, computing adaptive symbolic representations would enable more accurate representations of the dataset without compromising the dimensionality reduction. Therefore we propose a new generic framework to compute adaptive Segmentation Based Symbolic Representations ({SBSR}) of time series. {SBSR} can be applied to any model but we focus on piecewise constant models ({SBSRL0}) which are the most commonly used. {SBSR} are built by computing both the episode boundaries and the symbolic alphabet in order to minimize information loss of the resulting symbolic representation. We also propose a new distance measure for {SBSRL0} tightly lower bounding the euclidean distance measure.},

    abstract = {The problem of finding a specified pattern in a time series database (i.e., query by content) has received much attention and is now a relatively mature field. In contrast, the important problem of enumerating all surprising or interesting patterns has received far less attention. This problem requires a meaningful definition of  ” surprise”, and an efficient search technique. All previous attempts at finding surprising patterns in time series use a very limited notion of surprise, and/or do not scale to massive datasets. To overcome these limitations we propose a novel technique that defines a pattern surprising if the frequency of its occurrence differs substantially from that expected by chance, given some previously seen data. This notion has the advantage of not requiring the user to explicitly define what is a surprising pattern, which may be hard, or perhaps impossible, to elicit from a domain expert. Instead, the user gives the algorithm a collection of previously observed  ” normal” 
data. Our algorithm uses a suffix tree to efficiently encode the frequency of all observed patterns and allows a Markov model to predict the expected frequency of previously unobserved patterns. Once the suffix tree has been constructed, a measure of surprise for all the patterns in a new database can be determined in time and space linear in the size of the database. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with an extensive experimental evaluation.},

    abstract = {Time series of remote sensing imagery or derived vegetation indices and biophysical products have been shown particularly useful to characterize land ecosystem dynamics. Various methods have been developed based on temporal trajectory analysis to characterize, classify and detect changes in ecosystem dynamics. Although time series similarity measures play an important role in these methods, a quantitative comparison of the similarity measures is lacking. The objective of this study was to provide an overview and quantitative comparison of the similarity measures in function of varying time series and ecosystem characteristics, such as amplitude, timing and noise effects. For this purpose, the performance was evaluated for the commonly used similarity measures (D), ranging from Manhattan ({DMan}), Euclidean ({DE}) and Mahalanobis ({DMah}) distance measures, to correlation ({DCC}), Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}; {DPCA}) and Fourier based ({DFFT},{D\^{I}¾,DFk}) similarities. The 
quantitative comparison consists of a series of {Monte-Carlo} simulations based on subsets of global {MODIS} Normalized Difference Vegetation index ({NDVI}) and Enhanced Vegetation Index ({EVI}) and Leaf Area Index ({LAI}) data. Results of the simulations reveal four main groups of time series similarity measures with different sensitivities: (i) {DMan}, {DE}, {DPCA}, {DFk} quantify the difference in time series values, (ii) {DMah} accounts for temporal correlation and non-stationarity of variance, (iii) {DCC} measures the temporal correlation, and (iv) the Fourier based {DFFT} and D\^{I}¾ show their specific sensitivity based on the selected Fourier components. The difference measures show relatively the highest sensitivity to amplitude effects, whereas the correlation based measures are highly sensitive to variations in timing and noise. The Fourier based measures, finally, depend highly on the signal to noise ratio and the balance between amplitude and phase dominance. The heterogeneity in sensitivity of 
each D stresses the importance of (i) understanding the time series characteristics before applying any classification of change detection approach and (ii) defining the variability one wants to identify/account for. This requires an understanding of the ecosystem dynamics and time series characteristics related to the baseline, amplitude, timing, noise and variability of the ecosystem time series. This is also illustrated in the quantitative comparison, where the different sensitivities of D for the {NDVI}, {EVI}, and {LAI} data relate specifically to the temporal characteristics of each data set. Additionally, the effect of noise and intra- and interclass variability is demonstrated in a case study based on land cover classification. \^{a}º A quantitative comparison of time series similarity measures D is performed. \^{a}º Four groups of D with different sensitivities are obtained. \^{a}º Time series characteristics, noise and variability affect the performance of D. \^{a}º The sensitivities stress the 
importance of proper selection of similarity measures. \^{a}º Understanding time series properties is crucial for classification/change detection.},

There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research.

The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with 
models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used.

    abstract = {The process of E-type software development and evolution has
proven most difficult to improve, possibly due to the fact that the
process is a multi-input, multi-output system involving feedback at many
levels. This observation, first recorded in the early 1970s during an
extended study of {OS}/360 evolution, was recently captured in a {FEAST}
(Feedback, Evolution And Software Technology) hypothesis: a hypothesis
being studied in on-going two-year project, {FEAST}/1. Preliminary
conclusions based on a study of a financial transaction {system-Logica}'s
Fastwire ({FW})-are outlined and compared with those reached during the
earlier {OS}/360 study. The new analysis supports, or better does not
contradict, the laws of software evolution, suggesting that the 1970s
approach to metric analysis of software evolution is still relevant
today. It is hoped that {FEAST}/1 will provide a foundation for mastering
the feedback aspects of the software evolution process, opening up new
paths for process modelling and improvement},

Identical surveys and methodology were used to collect this data: random sample telephone selection within the identified telephone exchanges, computer-assisted telephone interviews, overselection of children and weekends in the 24-h recall diary and the same interviewers. Very similar response rates were obtained: 63\% ({NHAPS}) and 64.5\% ({CHAPS}). Results of comparisons by age within major activity and location groups suggest activity and location patterns are very similar (most differences being less than 1\% or 14 min in a 24-h day) with the exception of seasonal differences. Canadians spend less time outdoors in winter and less time indoors in summer than their {U.S}. counterparts. When 
exposure assessments use time of year or outdoor/indoor exposure gradients, these differences may result in significant differences in exposure assessments. Otherwise, the 24-h time activity patterns of North Americans are remarkably similar and use of the combined data set for some exposure assessments may be feasible.},

    abstract = {Modern software is often developed over many years with hundreds of thousands of commits. Commit metadata is a rich source of social characteristics, including the commit's time of day and the experience and commit frequency of its author. The "bugginess" of a commit is also a critical property of that commit. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between a commit's social characteristics and its "bugginess"; such results can be very useful for software developers and software engineering researchers. For instance, developers or code reviewers might be well-advised to thoroughly verify commits that are more likely to be buggy. In this paper, we study the correlation between a commit's bugginess and the time of day of the commit, the day of week of the commit, and the experience and commit frequency of the commit authors. We survey two widely-used open source projects: the Linux kernel and {PostgreSQL}. Our main findings include: (1) commits submitted between midnight and 4 {AM} (
referred to as late-night commits) are significantly buggier and commits between 7 {AM} and noon are less buggy, implying that developers may want to double-check their own latenight commits; (2) daily-committing developers produce less-buggy commits, indicating that we may want to promote the practice of daily-committing developers reviewing other developers' commits; and (3) the bugginess of commits versus day-of-week varies for different software projects.},

    abstract = {Interpretations of {TF}-{IDF} are based on binary independence retrieval, Poisson, information theory, and language modelling. This paper contributes a review of existing interpretations, and then, {TF}-{IDF} is systematically related to the probabilities P(q|d) and P(d|q). Two approaches are explored: a space of independent, and a space of disjoint terms. For independent terms, an "extreme" query/non-query term assumption uncovers {TF}-{IDF}, and an analogy of P(d|q) and the probabilistic odds O(r|d, q) mirrors relevance feedback. For disjoint terms, a relationship between probability theory and {TF}-{IDF} is established through the integral + 1/x dx = log x. This study uncovers components such as divergence from randomness and pivoted document length to be inherent parts of a document-query independence ({DQI}) measure, and interestingly, an integral of the {DQI} over the term occurrence probability leads to {TF}-{IDF}.},

We validate this approach by means of a case study on the {MySQL} database system; in this case study, we found patterns which suggested {MySQL} was behaving consistently within itself.

    abstract = {This paper presents an approach to recover time variant information from software repositories. It is widely accepted that software evolves due to factors such as defect removal, market opportunity or adding new features. Software evolution details are stored in software repositories which often contain the changes history. On the other hand there is a lack of approaches, technologies and methods to efficiently extract and represent time dependent information. Disciplines such as signal and image processing or speech recognition adopt frequency domain representations to mitigate differences of signals evolving in time. Inspired by time-frequency duality, this paper proposes the use of Linear Predictive Coding ({LPC}) and Cepstrum coefficients to model time varying software artifact histories. {LPC} or Cepstrum allow obtaining very compact representations with linear complexity. These representations can be used to highlight components and artifacts evolved in the same way or with very similar 
evolution patterns. To assess the proposed approach we applied {LPC} and Cepstral analysis to 211 Linux kernel releases (i.e., from 1.0 to 1.3.100), to identify files with very similar size histories. The approach, the preliminary results and the lesson learned are presented in this paper.},

    abstract = {Within the field of software repository mining, it is common practice to extract change-events from source control systems and then abstract these events to allow for different analyses. One approach is to apply time-series analysis by aggregating these events into signals. Time-series analysis requires that researchers specify a period of study; usually ldquonaturalrdquo periods such as days, months, and years are chosen. As yet there has been no research to validate that these assumptions are reasonable. We address this by applying Fourier analysis to discover the ldquonaturalrdquo periodicities of software development. Fourier analysis can detect and determine the periodicity of repeating events. Fourier transforms represent signals as linear combinations of sine-waves that suggest how much activity occurs at certain frequencies. If behaviors of different frequencies are mixed into one signal, they can be separated. Thus Fourier transforms can help us identify significant development 
process sub-signals within software projects.},

                Most sequence comparison methods assume that the data being compared are trustworthy, but this is not the case with raw {DNA} sequences obtained from automatic sequencing machines. Nevertheless, sequence comparisons need to be done on them in order to remove vector splice sites and contaminants. This step is necessary before other genomic data processing stages can be carried out, such as fragment assembly or {EST} clustering. A specialized tool is therefore needed to solve this apparent dilemma.
                We have designed and implemented a program that specifically addresses the problem. This program, called {LUCY}, has been in use since 1998 at The Institute for Genomic Research ({TIGR}). During this period, many rounds of experience-driven modifications were made to {LUCY} to improve its accuracy and its ability to deal with extremely difficult input cases. We believe we have finally obtained a useful program which strikes a delicate balance among the many issues involved in the raw sequence cleaning problem, and we wish to share it with the research community.
                {LUCY} is available directly from {TIGR} (http://www.tigr.org/softlab). Academic users can download {LUCY} after accepting a free academic use license. Business users may need to pay a license fee to use {LUCY} for commercial purposes.

    abstract = {Delivering increasingly complex software-reliant systems demands better ways to manage the long-term effects of short-term expedients. The technical debt metaphor is gaining significant traction in the agile development community as a way to understand and communicate such issues. The idea is that developers sometimes accept compromises in a system in one dimension (e.g., modularity) to meet an urgent demand in some other dimension (e.g., a deadline), and that such compromises incur a "debt": on which "interest" has to be paid and which the "principal" should be repaid at some point for the long-term health of the project. We argue that the software engineering research community has an opportunity to study and improve this concept. We can offer software engineers a foundation for managing such trade-offs based on models of their economic impacts. Therefore, we propose managing technical debt as a part of the future research agenda for the software engineering field.},

                Indole Acetic Acid 9 ({IAA9}) is a negative auxin response regulator belonging to the {Aux/IAA} transcription factor gene family whose downregulation triggers fruit set before pollination, thus giving rise to parthenocarpy. In situ hybridization experiments revealed that a tissue-specific gradient of {IAA9} expression is established during flower development, the release of which upon pollination triggers the initiation of fruit development. Comparative transcriptome and targeted metabolome analysis uncovered important features of the molecular events underlying pollination-induced and pollination-independent fruit set. Comprehensive transcriptomic profiling identified a high number of genes common to both types of fruit set, among which only a small subset are dependent on {IAA9} regulation. The fine-tuning of {Aux/IAA} and {ARF} genes and the downregulation of {TAG1} and {TAGL6} {MADS} box genes are instrumental in triggering the fruit set program. Auxin and ethylene emerged as the most 
active signaling hormones involved in the flower-to-fruit transition. However, while these hormones affected only a small number of transcriptional events, dramatic shifts were observed at the metabolic and developmental levels. The activation of photosynthesis and sucrose metabolism-related genes is an integral regulatory component of fruit set process. The combined results allow a far greater comprehension of the regulatory and metabolic events controlling early fruit development both in the presence and absence of pollination/fertilization.

If you haven't been made aware of them, you're often condemned not to repeat their {successes.In} a rapidly expanding field such as software engineering, this happens a lot. Extensive studies of many software projects such as the Standish Reports offer convincing evidence that many projects fail to repeat past {successes.This} paper tries to identify at least some of the major past software experiences that were well worth repeating, and some that were not.

Previous discussion of this topic has been hampered by the lack of a precise characterization of the nonrational components--specifically a characterization of the mechanisms of managerial judgment and intuition. Simon provides a description of intuitive and judgmental processes and a sketch of the evidence that is available to support this description. Further, his paper shows how intuition and judgment rest on extensive experience and knowledge; how, in fact, they can be understood in terms of the recognition of cues and the consequent evocation from memory of relevant experiences. In a final section of the paper, Simon discusses some of the pathologies commonly encountered in 
managerial behavior, both those produced by emotions and stress and those arising from the lack of appropriate habits--that is to say, of appropriate intuitive responses. This diagnosis leads Simon to some rather specific conclusions about the kinds of intuitions that need to be cultivated and habituated in organizations, and some of the ways in which they can be developed.},

Harvard education, cut off short of the bachelor's degree, was followed by
nearly forty years in the American Telephone \& Telegraph Company. His career
began in the Statistical Department, took him to technical expertness in the
economics of rates and administrative experience in the management of
commercial operations, and culminated in the presidency of the New Jersey Bell
Telephone Company. He was not directly involved in the Western Electric
experiments conducted chiefly at the Hawthorne plant in Cicero, but his
association with Elton Mayo and the latter's colleagues at the Harvard
Business School had an important bearing on his most original ideas.

Barnard's executive experience at {AT}\&T was paralleled and followed by a career
in public service unusual in his own time and hardly routine today. He was at
various times president of the United Services Organization (the {USO} of World
War {II}), head of the General Education Board and later president of the
Rockefeller Foundation (after Raymond Fosdick and before Dean Rusk), chairman
of the National Science Foundation, an assistant to the Secretary of the
Treasury, a consultant to the American representative in the United Nations
Atomic Energy Committee, to name only some of his public interests. He was a
director of a number of companies, a fellow of the American Association for

@article{citeulike:3112209,
    abstract = {Understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the regulation of the transcriptome present in eukaryotic cells is one of the most challenging tasks in the postgenomic era. In this regard, alternative splicing ({AS}) is a key phenomenon contributing to the production of different mature transcripts from the same primary {RNA} sequence. As a plethora of different transcript forms is available in databases, a first step to uncover the biology that drives {AS} is to identify the different types of reflected splicing variation. In this work, we present a general definition of the {AS} event along with a notation system that involves the relative positions of the splice sites. This nomenclature univocally and dynamically assigns a specific  ” {AS} code” to every possible pattern of splicing variation. On the basis of this definition and the corresponding codes, we have developed a computational tool ({AStalavista}) that automatically characterizes the complete landscape of {AS} events in a 
given transcript annotation of a genome, thus providing a platform to investigate the transcriptome diversity across genes, chromosomes, and species. Our analysis reveals that a substantial part—in human more than a quarter—of the observed splicing variations are ignored in common classification pipelines. We have used {AStalavista} to investigate and to compare the {AS} landscape of different reference annotation sets in human and in other metazoan species and found that proportions of {AS} events change substantially depending on the annotation protocol, species-specific attributes, and coding constraints acting on the transcripts. The {AStalavista} system therefore provides a general framework to conduct specific studies investigating the occurrence, impact, and regulation of {AS}. The genome sequence is said to be an organism's blueprint, a set of instructions driving the organism's biology. The unfolding of these instructions—the so-called genes—is initiated by the transcription of {DNA} into {RNA} 
molecules, which subsequently are processed before they can take their functional role. During this processing step, initially identical {RNA} molecules may result in different products through a process known as alternative splicing ({AS}). {AS} therefore allows for widening the diversity from the limited repertoire of genes, and it is often postulated as an explanation for the apparent paradox that complex and simple organisms resemble in their number of genes; it characterizes species, individuals, and developmental and cellular conditions. Comparing the differences of {AS} products between cells may help to reveal the broad molecular basis underlying phenotypic differences—for instance, between a cancer and a normal cell. An obstacle for such comparisons has been that, so far, no paradigm existed to delineate each single quantum of {AS}, so-called {AS} events. Here, we describe a possibility of exhaustively decomposing {AS} complements into qualitatively different groups of events and a nomenclature to 
unequivocally denote them. This typological catalogue of {AS} events along with their observed frequencies represent the {AS} landscape, and we propose a procedure to automatically identify such landscapes. We use it to describe the human {AS} landscape and to investigate how it has changed throughout evolution.},

    abstract = {Although Manduca sexta has significantly contributed to our knowledge on a variety of insect physiological processes, the lack of its genome sequence hampers the large-scale gene discovery, transcript profiling, and proteomic analysis in this biochemical model species. Here we report our implementation of the {RNA}-Seq {cDNA} sequencing approach based on massively parallel pyrosequencing, which allows us to categorize transcripts based on their relative abundances and to discover process- or tissue-specifically regulated genes simultaneously. We obtained 1,821,652 reads with an average length of 289 bp per read from fat body and hemocytes of na\"{i}ve and microbe-injected M. sexta larvae. After almost all (92.1\%) of these reads were assembled into 19,020 contigs, we identified 528 contigs whose relative abundances increased at least 5- and 8-fold in fat body and hemocytes, respectively, after the microbial challenge. Polypeptides encoded by these contigs include pathogen recognition 
receptors, extracellular and intracellular signal mediators and regulators, antimicrobial peptides, and proteins with no known sequence but likely participating in defense in novel ways. We also found 250 and 161 contigs that were preferentially expressed in fat body and hemocytes, respectively. Furthermore, we integrated data from our previous study and generated a sequence database to support future gene annotation and proteomic analysis in M. sexta. In summary, we have successfully established a combined approach for gene discovery and expression profiling in organisms lacking known genome sequences.},

                High-throughput sequencing technologies, such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer, are powerful new tools for investigating a wide range of biological and medical questions. Statistical and computational methods are key for drawing meaningful and accurate conclusions from the massive and complex datasets generated by the sequencers. We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression ({DE}) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing ({mRNA}-Seq) data.
                We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly {DE} between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how {DE} results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on {DE} results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., {RPKM}) can bias estimates of {DE}. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in {DE} detection.
                Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of {mRNA}-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and {DE} inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results. They also reveal the need for further research in the development of statistical and computational methods for {mRNA}-Seq.

Since the development is distributed across different tool environments and developer practices, any analysis of project behavior must be inferred from whatever common artifacts happen to be available. In this paper, we propose an approach to characterizing a project's behavior around the time of major and minor releases; we do this by partitioning the observed activities, such as artifact check-ins, around the dates of major and minor releases, and then look for recognizable patterns. We validate this approach by means of a case study on the {MySQL} database system; in this case study, we found patterns which suggested {MySQL} was behaving consistently within itself. These patterns included testing and documenting that took place more before a release than after and that the rate of source code changes dipped around release time.},

    abstract = {Moments before the launch of every space vehicle, engineering discipline specialists must make a critical go/no-go decision. The cost of a false positive, allowing a launch in spite of a fault, or a false negative, stopping a potentially successful launch, can be measured in the tens of millions of dollars, not including the cost in morale and other more intangible detriments. The Aerospace Corporation is responsible for providing engineering assessments critical to the go/no-go decision for every Department of Defense space vehicle. These assessments are made by constantly monitoring streaming telemetry data in the hours before launch. We will introduce {VizTree}, a novel time-series visualization tool to aid the Aerospace analysts who must make these engineering assessments. {VizTree} was developed at the University of California, Riverside and is unique in that the same tool is used for mining archival data and monitoring incoming live telemetry. The use of a single tool for both aspects 
of the task allows a natural and intuitive transfer of mined knowledge to the monitoring task. Our visualization approach works by transforming the time series into a symbolic representation, and encoding the data in a modified suffix tree in which the frequency and other properties of patterns are mapped onto colors and other visual properties. We demonstrate the utility of our system by comparing it with state-of-the-art batch algorithms on several real and synthetic datasets.},

Their reasons include: {CMM} and {ISO} 9000 compliance, process validation, management, acquisitions, and business intelligence. Recovering the software development processes from an existing project is expensive if one must rely upon manual inspection of artifacts and interviews of developers and their managers. Researchers have suggested live observation and instrumentation of a project to allow for more measurement, but this is costly, invasive, and also requires a live running project. Instead, we propose an after the fact analysis: software process recovery. This approach analyzes version control systems, bug trackers and mailing list archives using a variety of supervised and unsupervised techniques from machine learning, topic analysis, natural language processing and statistics. We can combine all of these methods to recover 
process events that we map back to software development processes like the Unified Process. We can produce diagrams called Recovered Unified Process Views ({RUPV}) that are similar to the Unified Process diagram, a time-line of effort per parallel discipline occurring across time. We then validate these methods using case studies of multiple open source software systems.},

    abstract = {Ants rely heavily on olfaction for communication and orientation. Here we provide the first detailed structure–function analyses within an ant's central olfactory system asking whether in the carpenter ant, Camponotus floridanus, the olfactory pathway exhibits adaptations to processing many pheromonal and general odors. Using fluorescent tracing, confocal microscopy, and {3D}-analyses we demonstrate that the antennal lobe ({AL}) contains up to ≈460 olfactory glomeruli organized in seven distinct clusters innervated via seven antennal sensory tracts. The {AL} is divided into two hemispheres regarding innervation of glomeruli by either projection neurons ({PNs}) with axons leaving via the medial (m) or lateral (l) antennocerebral tract ({ACT}). M- and {l-ACT} {PNs} differ in their target areas in the mushroom-body calyx and lateral horn. Three additional {ACTs} project to the lateral protocerebrum only. We analyzed odor processing in {AL} glomeruli by retrograde loading of {PNs} with Fura-2 
dextran and fluorimetric calcium imaging. Odor responses were reproducible and comparable across individuals. Calcium responses to pheromonal and nonpheromonal odors were very sensitive (10−11 dilution) and patterns were partly overlapping, indicating that processing of both odor classes is not spatially segregated within the {AL}. Response patterns to the main trail-pheromone component nerolic acid remained stable over a wide range of intensities (7–8 log units), while response durations increased indicating that odor quality is maintained by a stable pattern and intensity is mainly encoded in response durations. The structure–function analyses contribute new insights into important aspects of odor processing in a highly advanced insect olfactory system. J. Comp.

The functional insect {OR} consists of a heteromeric complex of unknown stoichiometry but comprising at least one variable odorant-binding subunit and one constant Or83b family subunit10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. Insect {ORs} lack homology to G-protein-coupled chemosensory receptors in vertebrates17 and possess a distinct seven-transmembrane topology with the amino terminus located intracellularly10, 18. Here we provide evidence that heteromeric insect {ORs} comprise a new class of ligand-activated non-selective cation channels. Heterologous cells expressing silkmoth, fruitfly or mosquito heteromeric {OR} complexes showed extracellular Ca2+ influx and cation-non-selective ion conductance on stimulation with odorant. Odour-evoked {OR} currents are 
independent of known G-protein-coupled second messenger pathways. The fast response kinetics and {OR}-subunit-dependent K+ ion selectivity of the insect {OR} complex support the hypothesis that the complex between {OR} and Or83b itself confers channel activity. Direct evidence for odorant-gated channels was obtained by outside-out patch-clamp recording of Xenopus oocyte and {HEK293T} cell membranes expressing insect {OR} complexes. The ligand-gated ion channel formed by an insect {OR} complex seems to be the basis for a unique strategy that insects have acquired to respond to the olfactory environment.},

@article{citeulike:2680014,
    abstract = {From worm to man, many odorant signals are perceived by the binding of volatile ligands to odorant receptors1 that belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor ({GPCR}) family2. They couple to heterotrimeric G-proteins, most of which induce {cAMP} production3. This second messenger then activates cyclic-nucleotide-gated ion channels to depolarize the olfactory receptor neuron, thus providing a signal for further neuronal processing. Recent findings, however, have challenged this concept of odorant signal transduction in insects, because their odorant receptors, which lack any sequence similarity to other {GPCRs4}, are composed of conventional odorant receptors (for example, Or22a), dimerized with a ubiquitously expressed chaperone protein5, such as Or83b in Drosophila6. Or83b has a structure akin to {GPCRs}, but has an inverted orientation in the plasma membrane4, 7. However, G proteins are expressed in insect olfactory receptor neurons8, and olfactory perception is modified by mutations 
affecting the {cAMP} transduction pathway9. Here we show that application of odorants to mammalian cells co-expressing Or22a and Or83b results in non-selective cation currents activated by means of an ionotropic and a metabotropic pathway, and a subsequent increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Expression of Or83b alone leads to functional ion channels not directly responding to odorants, but being directly activated by intracellular {cAMP} or {cGMP}. Insect odorant receptors thus form ligand-gated channels as well as complexes of odorant-sensing units and cyclic-nucleotide-activated non-selective cation channels. Thereby, they provide rapid and transient as well as sensitive and prolonged odorant signalling.},

@article{citeulike:5969736,
    abstract = { {SummaryIonotropic} glutamate receptors ({iGluRs}) mediate neuronal communication at synapses throughout vertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems. We have characterized a family of {iGluR}-related genes in Drosophila, which we name ionotropic receptors ({IRs}). These receptors do not belong to the well-described kainate, {AMPA}, or {NMDA} classes of {iGluRs}, and they have divergent ligand-binding domains that lack their characteristic glutamate-interacting residues. {IRs} are expressed in a combinatorial fashion in sensory neurons that respond to many distinct odors but do not express either insect odorant receptors ({ORs}) or gustatory receptors ({GRs}). {IR} proteins accumulate in sensory dendrites and not at synapses. Misexpression of {IRs} in different olfactory neurons is sufficient to confer ectopic odor responsiveness. Together, these results lead us to propose that the {IRs} comprise a novel family of chemosensory receptors. Conservation of {IR}/{iGluR}-related proteins in 
bacteria, plants, and animals suggests that this receptor family represents an evolutionarily ancient mechanism for sensing both internal and external chemical cues. {IntroductionSpecies} as diverse as bacteria, plants, and humans have the capacity to sense small molecules in the environment. Chemical cues can transmit the presence of food, alarm signals, and messages from conspecifics that signify mating compatibility. Peripheral chemical recognition largely relies on membrane receptor proteins that interact with external ligands and convert this binding into intracellular responses. The vast majority of identified chemosensory receptors in multicellular organisms belong to the seven transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor ({GPCR}) superfamily, including odorant, gustatory, and pheromone receptors in mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and nematodes (Bargmann, 2006). Unicellular organisms also use {GPCRs} for chemoreception, such as the pheromone receptors in budding yeast (Dohlman, {2002).
Insects} can detect a wide range of environmental chemicals: bitter, sweet, and salty tastants, odors, pheromones, humidity, carbon dioxide, and carbonated water (reviewed in [Dahanukar et al., 2005], [Bargmann, 2006], [Vosshall and Stocker, 2007] and [Benton, 2008]). Most of these chemosensory stimuli are recognized by members of two evolutionarily related insect-specific chemosensory receptor families, the odorant receptors ({ORs}) and gustatory receptors ({GRs}). These proteins contain seven predicted transmembrane domains but are evolutionarily unrelated to {GPCRs} ([Vosshall et al., 1999], [Benton et al., 2006] and [Wistrand et al., 2006]) and adopt a distinct membrane topology ([Benton et al., 2006] and [Lundin et al., 2007]). Recent analysis has indicated that insect {ORs} function as odor-gated ion channels ([Sato et al., 2008] and [Wicher et al., 2008]), setting them mechanistically apart from metabotropic vertebrate {ORs}.Comprehensive analysis of the expression of these receptors in the fruit fly, 
Drosophila melanogaster, has hinted at the existence of other types of insect chemosensory receptors ([Couto et al., 2005] and [Yao et al., 2005]). This is particularly apparent in the major olfactory organ, the third segment of the antenna, which bears three types of olfactory sensory hairs (sensilla): basiconic, trichoid, and coeloconic. All olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs}) innervating basiconic and trichoid sensilla generally express one {OR}, along with the {OR83b} coreceptor (reviewed in Vosshall and Stocker, 2007). However, with the exception of {OR35a}/{OR83b}-expressing neurons (Yao et al., 2005), {OSNs} housed in coeloconic sensilla do not express {OR83b} or members of the {OR} or {GR} gene families ([Scott et al., 2001], [Couto et al., 2005] and [Yao et al., 2005]). Nevertheless, electrophysiological analysis has revealed the existence of multiple types of coeloconic {OSNs} tuned to acids, ammonia, and humidity (Yao et al., 2005), suggesting that other types of insect chemosensory receptors {
exist.We} previously carried out a bioinformatic screen for insect-specific genes with enriched expression in {OSNs} (Benton et al., 2007). Among these, we found members of a large expansion of the ionotropic glutamate receptor ({iGluR}) gene family of unknown biological function (Littleton and Ganetzky, 2000). Here, we provide evidence that these variant {iGluRs} represent a novel class of chemosensory receptor. Results A Large Family of Divergent Ionotropic Glutamate Receptor-like Genes in {DrosophilaFrom} a bioinformatic screen for olfactory molecules (Benton et al., 2007), we identified six antennal-expressed genes encoding proteins annotated as {iGluRs} (data not shown) (Littleton and Ganetzky, 2000). Using these receptor sequences as queries, exhaustive {BLAST} searches of the Drosophila genome identified a family of 61 predicted genes and two pseudogenes. These genes are distributed throughout the genome, both as individual sequences and in tandem arrays of up to four genes (Figure {1A}; data not 
shown). We named this family the ionotropic receptors ({IRs}) and assigned individual gene names to the {IRs} using nomenclature conventions of Drosophila {ORs} (Drosophila Odorant Receptor Nomenclature Committee, 2000) (Figure {1A}). Phylogenetic analysis of predicted {IR} protein sequences revealed that they are not closely related to members of the canonical families of {iGluRs} ({AMPA}, kainate, {NMDA}, or delta) (Figure {1B}). However, they appear to have a similar modular organization to {iGluRs}, comprising an extracellular N terminus, a bipartite ligand-binding domain, whose two lobes (S1 and S2) are separated by an ion channel domain, and a short cytoplasmic C terminus (Figure 1 and Figure 2 and data not shown) (Mayer, 2006). We note that the gene structure and protein sequence of most receptors are presently only computational predictions. Nevertheless, the family is extremely divergent, exhibiting overall amino acid sequence identity of 10\%–70\%. The most conserved region between {IRs} and {
iGluRs} spans the ion channel pore (Figure {1C}), suggesting that {IRs} retain ion-conducting properties. The ligand-binding domains are considerably more variable, although alignment of small regions of the S1 and S2 lobes of {IRs} and {iGluRs} allowed examination of conservation in amino acid positions that make direct contact with glutamate or artificial agonists in {iGluRs} ([Armstrong et al., 1998], [Armstrong and Gouaux, 2000], [Jin et al., 2003] and [Mayer, 2005]) (Figure 2). Although all {iGluRs} have an arginine (R) residue in S1 that binds the glutamate α-carboxyl group, only 19 out of 61 (31\%) {IRs} retain this residue (Figure {2A}). In the first half of the S2 domain, nine out of 61 (15\%) of {IRs} retain a threonine (T), which contacts the glutamate γ-carboxyl group in all {AMPA} and kainate receptors (Figure {2B}). Interestingly, the {iGluRs} that lack this T residue ({NR1}, {NR3A}, delta) have glycine or serine and not glutamate as a preferred ligand ([Mayer et al., 2006] and [Naur et al., 
2007]). Finally, in the second half of the S2 domain, 100\% of the {iGluRs} have a conserved aspartate (D) or glutamate (E) that interacts with the α-amino group of the glutamate ligand, compared with ten out of 61 (16\%) {IRs} (Figure {2B}). Of 61 {IRs}, only three ({IR8a}, {IR75a}, {IR75c}) retain the R, T, and {D/E} residues characteristic of {iGluRs}, although these residues lie within a divergent structural backbone. Other {IRs} have a diversity of different amino acids at one or more of these positions. Thus, the ligand-binding specificity of most or all {IRs} is likely to be both distinct from that of {iGluRs} and varied within the {IR} family. {IRs} Are Expressed in Chemosensory Neurons that Do Not Express {ORs} or {OR83bWe} determined the expression of the {IR} family by both tissue-specific {RT}-{PCR} and {RNA} in situ hybridization. Fifteen {IR} genes are expressed in the antenna (Figure {1A} and Figure 3). Transcripts of these genes were not detected elsewhere in the adult head, body, or 
appendages, except for {IR25a} and {IR76b}, which are also expressed in the proboscis (data not shown). Expression of the remaining 46 {IR} genes was not reproducibly detected in any adult tissue. It is unclear whether these genes are not expressed, expressed at different life stages, or expressed at levels below the detection threshold of our assays. We analyzed where in the antenna {IR} genes are expressed compared to {ORs} by double {RNA} in situ hybridization with probes for the {OR} coreceptor {OR83b} and one of several {IR} genes, including {IR64a}, {IR76b}, {IR31a}, and {IR40a} (Figure {3A} and data not shown). {IRs} are not expressed in basiconic and trichoid sensilla, as they are not coexpressed with {OR83b}, and {IR} expression persists in mutants for the proneural gene absent md neurons and olfactory sensilla (amos), which completely lack these sensilla types ([Goulding et al., 2000] and [zur Lage et al., 2003]) (Figure {3A}, top and middle panels; data not shown). However, expression of these {
IRs} is dependent upon the proneural gene atonal, which specifies the coeloconic sensilla as well as a feather-like projection called the arista, and a three-chambered pocket called the sacculus (Figure {3A}, bottom panel; data not shown) ([Gupta and Rodrigues, 1997] and [Jhaveri et al., 2000]). Thus, {ORs} and {IRs} are expressed in developmentally distinct sensory lineages in the antenna. One exception is the subpopulation of coeloconic {OSNs} that expresses both {IR76b} and {OR35a}/{OR83b} ([Couto et al., 2005] and [Yao et al., 2005]) (Figure {3A}). We confirmed that {IR}-expressing cells in the antenna are neurons by demonstrating that they coexpress the neuronal marker elav (Figure {3B} and data not {shown).We} next generated a comprehensive map of {IR} expression (Figures {3C}–{3F}). Each {IR} was observed to have a topologically defined expression pattern that is conserved across individuals of both sexes (data not shown). {IR8a} and {IR25a}, which encode closely related receptors (Figure {1B}), are 
broadly expressed, detected in overlapping populations of neurons around the sacculus and in the main portion of the antenna (Figure {3C}; data not shown). {IR25a} but not {IR8a} is also detected in the arista (data not shown; see below). {IR21a} is expressed in approximately six neurons in the arista (Figure {3D}), as well as five to ten neurons near the third chamber of the sacculus (Figure {3E}, bottom panel). Three {IRs} display specific expression in neurons surrounding the sacculus: {IR40a} and {IR93a} are coexpressed in 10–15 neurons adjacent to the first and second sacculus chambers (Figure {3E}, top panel), while {IR64a} is found in 10–15 neurons surrounding the third chamber (Figure {3E}, middle {panel).The} remaining nine {IRs} are expressed in coeloconic {OSNs} distributed across the antenna (Figure {3F}). Double and triple {RNA} in situ hybridization revealed that individual neurons express between one and three different {IR} genes and are organized into specific clusters of two or three 
neurons. Four distinct clusters (cluster A–cluster D), containing two (cluster C) or three (clusters A, B, and D) neurons, could be defined by their expression of stereotyped combinations of {IR} genes (Figure {3F}). Cluster C includes a coeloconic neuron that expresses {OR35a} and {OR83b} in addition to {IR76b}. Although each cluster is distinct, there is overlap between the {IRs} they express. {IR76b} is expressed in one neuron in all four clusters, {IR75d} in three clusters, and {IR75a} in two clusters (Figures {3B} and {3F}). In addition to these selectively expressed receptors, individual neurons are likely to express one or both of the broadly expressed {IR8a} and {IR25a} genes (Figure {3C}). The combinatorial expression patterns of the {IRs} raise the possibility that these genes define specific functional properties of these neurons. Integration of Molecular and Functional Maps of the Coeloconic {SensillaOur} definition of four distinct clusters of {IR}-expressing neurons in the antenna (Figure {3F}) 
is consistent with the identification of four types of coeloconic sensilla, named ac1–ac4, which have distinct yet partially overlapping sensory specificities (Yao et al., 2005). To examine whether {IR} expression correlates with the chemosensory properties of these {OSNs}, we compared the spatial organization of {IR}-expressing neurons using probes for unique {IR} markers for each cluster type to these functionally distinct sensilla types (Figure 4). As we lack a unique molecular marker for cluster B, this cluster was defined as those containing {IR75a}-expressing {OSNs} (present in cluster B and cluster C) that are not paired with {OR35a}-expressing cluster C neurons (Figure {4A}). We found that each cluster has a different, though overlapping, spatial distribution in the antenna (Figure {4A}). For example, cluster A neurons (marked by {IR31a}) are restricted to a zone at the anterior of the antenna, just below the arista, whereas cluster C neurons (marked by {IR75b}) are found exclusively in the posterior 
of the antenna. These stereotyped {IR} neuron distributions were observed in antennae from over 20 animals. The initial description of the coeloconic sensilla classes did not describe their spatial distribution (Yao et al., 2005). We therefore recorded odor-evoked responses in more than 100 coeloconic sensilla in several dozen animals across most of the accessible antennal surface, using a panel of odorants that allowed us to identify unambiguously each sensilla type (ammonia for ac1, 1,4-diaminobutane for ac2, propanal and hexanol for ac3, and phenylacetaldehyde for ac4) (Yao et al., 2005) (Figure {4B}, left). After electrophysiological identification, we noted the location of the sensilla on the antennal surface (Figure {4B}, {right).This} mapping process allowed a correlation of the electrophysiological and molecular properties of the coeloconic sensilla (Figure {4C}). For example, ac1 sensilla were only detected in a region on the anterior antennal surface just ventral to the arista, and therefore most 
likely correspond to cluster A, containing {IR31a}-{IR75d}-{IR76b}/{IR92a}-expressing neurons. Our data fit well with the previous assignment of the {OR35a}-expressing neuron to the ac3 sensillum (Yao et al., 2005), which is found on the posterior of the antenna and is the only coeloconic sensillum class that unambiguously houses two neurons (Yao et al., 2005) (Figure {4B} and data not shown). Although these results allow initial assignment of {IRs} to different coeloconic sensilla classes, we note that assignment of specific odor responses to individual {IR}-expressing {OSNs} is not possible from these data alone. Glomerular Convergence of {IR} {OSNs} in the Antennal {LobeAll} neurons expressing a given {OR} extend axons that converge upon a single antennal lobe glomerulus ([Couto et al., 2005] and [Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005]), resulting in the representation of a cognate odor ligand as a spatially defined pattern of neural activity within the brain. To ask whether {IR}-expressing neurons have the same 
wiring logic, we investigated the targeting of {OSNs} expressing {IR76a} by constructing an {IR76a}-promoter {GAL4} driver that recapitulates the endogenous expression pattern (Brand and Perrimon, 1993) (Figure {5A}). Labeling of these neurons with {mCD8}:{GFP} revealed convergence of their axons on to a single glomerulus, ventral medial 4 ({VM4}), in the antennal lobe (Figure {5B}). This glomerulus is one of approximately eight that was previously unaccounted for by maps of axonal projections of {OR}-expressing {OSNs} ([Couto et al., 2005] and [Vosshall and Stocker, 2007]). {IR} Proteins Localize to Sensory {CiliaTo} determine where {IRs} localize in sensory neurons, we generated antibodies against {IR25a}. We detected broad expression of {IR25a} protein in sensory neurons of the arista, sacculus, and coeloconic sensilla (Figure {5C}, left). All {anti-IR25a} immunoreactivity was abolished in an {IR25a} null mutant (Figure {5C}, right). Low levels of {IR25a} could be detected in the axon segment adjacent to 
the cell body in some neurons, but no staining was observed along the axons as they entered the brain or at synapses within antennal lobe glomeruli (Figure {5D}). In coeloconic neurons, prominent {anti-IR25a} staining was detected both in the cell body and in the distal tip of the dendrite, which corresponds to the ciliated outer dendritic segment innervating the sensory hair (Figure {5E}). Relatively low levels were detected in the inner dendrites, suggesting the existence of a transport mechanism to concentrate receptor protein in cilia. A similar subcellular localization was observed in sacculus and aristal sensory neurons (Figures {5F} and {5G}). The specific targeting of an {IR} to sensory cilia suggests a role for these proteins in sensory detection. Inducing Ectopic Olfactory Sensitivity by Misexpression of {IRsTo} test the hypothesis that {IR} genes encode chemosensory receptors, we investigated whether ectopic {IR} expression was sufficient to confer nonnative olfactory specificities. Three {IRs} 
expressed in ac4 sensilla ({IR84a}, {IR76a}, and {IR75d}) were individually misexpressed in ac3 sensilla with the {OR35a}-{GAL4} driver (Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005). We used single-sensillum recordings to examine which, if any, of these three {IRs} could confer sensitivity to phenylacetaldehyde, the only known robust ligand for ac4 but not ac3 sensilla (Yao et al., 2005). Misexpression of {IR84a} conferred a strong response to phenylacetaldehyde (Figure {6A}) that was not observed in control strains or in animals misexpressing either {IR76a} or {IR75d} (Figure {6B}). Ectopically expressed {IR84a} did not confer sensitivity to the structurally related odor, phenylacetonitrile, which does not activate either ac3 or ac4 neurons (Yao et al., 2005). This indicates that misexpressed {IR84a} does not simply generate nonspecific ligand sensitivity in these neurons. We next compared the odor responses conferred by {IR84a} misexpression to the endogenous phenylacetaldehyde responses of ac4 sensilla by generating 
dose-response curves (Figures {6C} and {6D}). Stimulus-evoked spike frequencies of ac3 sensilla ectopically expressing {IR84a} are quantitatively very similar to those in ac4 sensilla, even exceeding the endogenous ac4 responses at higher odor concentrations (Figure {6D}). These elevated responses are likely to be due to the contribution of weak endogenous phenylacetaldehyde responses that we observed in ac3 sensilla at high stimulus concentrations (Figures {6C} and {6D}), as subtraction of these values produces an {IR84a}-dependent phenylacetaldehyde dose-response curve that is statistically the same as that of ac4 sensilla (Figure {6E}). Thus, misexpression of a single {IR} in ac3 is sufficient to confer an ectopic ligand- and receptor-specific odor sensitivity that is physiologically indistinguishable from endogenous {responses.To} extend this analysis to a second {IR}, we examined whether misexpression of one of the {IR} genes uniquely expressed in ammonia-sensitive ac1 neurons ({IR31a} and {IR92a}) was 
sufficient to confer ectopic responsiveness to this odor. Because ac3 sensilla neurons display endogenous ammonia-evoked responses at modest stimulus concentrations, we used in these experiments the {IR76a}-promoter {GAL4} transgene to misexpress these receptors in ammonia-insensitive ac4 sensilla (Figure {7A}) (Yao et al., 2005). When {IR92a} was misexpressed in ac4 sensilla, these neurons became sensitive to stimulation by ammonia (Figures {7A} and {7B}). 1,4-diaminobutane, a control stimulus that does not activate either ac1 or ac4 neurons (Yao et al., 2005), did not stimulate ac4 sensilla misexpressing {IR92a}. Moreover, we did not observe nonspecific responses to ammonia in control {UAS}-{IR92a} animals or in animals in which a different receptor, {IR31a}, was misexpressed in ac4 {OSNs} (Figure {7B}). We note that the magnitude of the ectopic {IR92a} ammonia response is lower than native ammonia-evoked responses of ac1 sensilla (Yao et al., 2005). This may be due to the lack of cofactors present in ac1 
sensilla but not in ac4 sensilla. Nevertheless, these results suggest that {IR92a} comprises at least part of an ammonia-specific chemosensory receptor. {DiscussionWe} present a characterization of the {IRs}, a family of {iGluR}-related proteins in Drosophila. The ligand-binding domains of {IRs} are divergent, and most lack known glutamate-binding residues, suggesting that they recognize distinct ligands. {IRs} are expressed in chemosensory neurons that do not express known insect chemosensory receptors, the {ORs} and {GRs}. Spatial patterns of {IR} gene expression correlate with known ligand sensitivities of these neurons. {IR} proteins concentrate in the sensory cilia where chemical detection takes place. Misexpression analysis provides genetic evidence that the {IRs} function as chemosensory receptors. These receptors may define a molecular basis for Drosophila chemosensory modalities not linked to known receptor genes. Moreover, the {IRs} may reveal important evolutionary links in chemical detection 
mechanisms in diverse types of cells across prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Molecular Biology of {IR} {FunctionThe} specific combinatorial expression patterns of {IRs} in sensory neurons and the diversity in their ligand-binding domains is difficult to rationalize with a general role in signal transduction, independent of ligand recognition. More importantly, the nonnative olfactory sensitivity induced by ectopic expression of {IR84a} and {IR92a} provides evidence that {IR} proteins function directly as ligand-specific chemosensory receptors. Although these experiments demonstrate a sufficiency of {IRs} for conferring odor responsiveness, definitive proof of their necessity will require analysis of loss-of-function {mutations.In} animal nervous systems, {iGluRs} mediate neuronal communication by forming glutamate-gated ion channels (Mayer, 2006), and we speculate that {IRs} also form ion channels, gated by odors and other chemosensory stimuli. A growing number of ionotropic mechanisms in chemoreception are known.
 For example, members of the transient receptor potential ({TRP}) family of ion channels are the primary receptors for nociceptive compounds including capsaicin and menthol ([Jordt et al., 2003] and [Bandell et al., 2007]) and have also been implicated in gustatory detection of acids ([Huang et al., 2006] and [Ishimaru et al., 2006]). Insect {ORs} also display functional properties of ion channels ([Sato et al., 2008] and [Wicher et al., 2008]). Proof that {IRs} function as ion channels will necessitate electrophysiological characterization of these receptors in heterologous expression systems, and evidence for direct binding of chemosensory ligands to {IRs} will require biochemical assays in {vitro.iGluRs} normally function as heterotetrameric assemblies of variable subunit composition that exhibit differing functional properties such as ligand sensitivity and ion permeability. Our analysis indicates that up to five different {IRs} may be coexpressed in a single sensory neuron, raising the possibility that 
these receptors also form multimeric protein assemblies with subunit-dependent characteristics. Of particular interest are the two broadly expressed members of the family, {IR8a} and {IR25a}, which may represent common subunits in many different types of {IR} complexes. Their function is unclear, but it is possible that they have a coreceptor function with other {IRs}, analogous to that of {OR83b} ([Larsson et al., 2004], [Nakagawa et al., 2005], [Benton et al., 2006] and [Sato et al., 2008]). Preliminary analysis of {IR25a} mutants revealed no obvious defects in odor-evoked responses in coeloconic sensilla (data not shown), but this may be due to redundancy of {IR25a} with {IR8a} or the existence of homomeric {IR} receptors without {IR8a} or {IR25a}. Other {IRs}, such as {IR75a} and {IR76b}, are expressed in two or more types of coeloconic sensory neurons. In these cases, the response properties may be defined by the combination of {IRs} expressed in these distinct neuronal populations. However, the present 
lack of knowledge of relevant ligands for several coeloconic {OSNs} makes it difficult to match specific ligands to individual {IR} neurons on the basis of our expression map alone. Comparative Chemosensation by {IRs} and {ORsThe} {IR} repertoire is remarkably similar in size, overall genomic organization, and sequence divergence to Drosophila {ORs}. Like the {ORs}, individual {IRs} are specifically expressed in small subpopulations of chemosensory neurons, and this expression is regulated by relatively short (<1–2 kb) upstream regulatory regions ([Couto et al., 2005], [Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005] and [Ray et al., 2007]) (Figures {5A} and {5B}; and {R.B}., unpublished data). Furthermore, at least one population of {IR}-expressing neurons converges on to a single glomerulus in the antennal lobe, similar to the wiring logic established for {OR}-expressing neurons both in invertebrate and vertebrate olfactory systems ([Mombaerts et al., 1996], [Gao et al., 2000], [Vosshall et al., 2000], [Couto et al., 2005]
 and [Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005]). Some differences are observed, however, in the organizational logic of {IR} and {OR} expression. Most {OR}-expressing neurons express a single {OR} gene, along with {OR83b}, in distinct clusters that innervate specific olfactory sensilla. In contrast, many {IR}-expressing neurons identified in the antenna express two or three {IR} genes, in addition to one or both of the broadly expressed {IR8a} and {IR25a} genes. Moreover, overlap is observed both between the molecular composition of different {IR} neurons and the combination of neurons that innervate a given sensillum. For example, {IR76b} is coexpressed with at least two other different {IR} genes in at least two different sensilla—with {IR92a} in ac1 and with {IR76a} in ac4—as well as being coexpressed with {OR35a} and {OR83b} in ac3. Although the precise biological logic of {IR} coexpression awaits the matching of specific chemosensory ligands to {IR}-expressing neurons, combinatorial expression of {IRs} may 
contribute more significantly to their role in sensory detection than for {ORs}.Why does Drosophila possess two types of antennal chemosensory receptors? Although both may be ionotropic, {IRs} and {ORs} are not simply slight evolutionary variants. The receptor families are molecularly unrelated, are under the control of distinct developmental programs, and are housed within sensory structures of radically different morphology. Thus, it seems likely that these chemosensory receptors fulfill distinct functions in chemosensation. Analysis of the chemosensory behaviors mediated by {IR} sensory circuits—now possible with our identification of specific molecular markers for these pathways—may provide insights into the contributions of these different olfactory subsystems. {IRs} may also have functions in other chemosensory modalities, as two antennal {IRs} are also detected in the proboscis, and the expression of 46 members of the repertoire remains unknown. An Evolutionarily Ancient {Chemical-Sensing} {
MechanismChemosensation} is an ancient sensory modality that predates the evolution of the eukaryotes. Are there traces of conservation in the molecular mechanism by which prokaryotes and eukaryotes sense external chemicals? {iGluRs} have long been recognized to have prokaryotic origins. Their ion channel domain is homologous to bacterial potassium channels, and the ligand binding domain is structurally related to bacterial periplasmic binding proteins ({PBPs}), extracellular proteins that scavenge or sense amino acids, carbohydrates, and metal ions by coupling to transporters or chemotaxis receptors ([Mayer and Armstrong, 2004] and [Mayer, 2006]). Evolutionary connections between {iGluRs} and {PBP} function have not often been considered, perhaps in part because of their very weak primary sequence similarity, the widespread occurrence of the {PBP} fold—also present, for example, in bacterial transcription regulators—and the dedicated role for {iGluRs} in mediating or regulating synaptic transmission, a 
process seemingly distant from bacterial solute uptake and {chemotaxis.Our} discovery of a family of divergent {iGluR}-like proteins that may act as peripheral chemosensors provides a link between the disparate functions of these protein modules. Although a role for {IRs} in detecting diverse external ligands is analogous to the function of bacterial {PBPs}, the primary sequence and neuronal expression of {IRs} is clearly closer to the properties of {iGluRs}. Intriguingly, a large family of {iGluR}-related proteins, the {GLRs}, has also been identified in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana ([Lam et al., 1998] and [Chiu et al., 1999]). Almost nothing is known about their physiological functions, but bioinformatic analysis of {GLRs} suggests that glutamate is unlikely to be their natural ligand ([Dubos et al., 2003] and [Qi et al., 2006]). It is possible that {GLRs} may have roles as chemosensors, for example in detection of soil nutrients or airborne volatiles. Thus, although {iGluRs} have been intensely studied 
for their roles in synaptic communication, our characterization of the {IRs} leads us to suggest that the ancestral function of this protein family may have been in detecting diverse chemical ligands to mediate both intercellular communication and environmental chemical sensing. Experimental Procedures Bioinformatics Gene {IdentificationIR} genes were identified by exhaustive searches of the Drosophila genome with {TBLASTN} and {PSI}-{BLAST} (Altschul et al., 1997). We used the {iGluR}-related genes that emerged from our comparative genomics screen (Benton et al., 2007) as initial queries to identify related genes, which were then used as queries in further searches in an iterative process until no new sequences were identified. Membrane topology and domain structure predictions of {IR} protein sequences were examined with {SignalP} 3.0 (Bendtsen et al., 2004), {TMHMM} 2.0 (Krogh et al., 2001), and {SMART} (Schultz et al., 1998). {CG14586} encodes two tandem ion channel domains, which we considered to be a 
likely computational misprediction and reannotated as two separate genes, each encoding a single ion channel domain (noted in Figure {1A} as {CG14586}-A, {CG14586}-B). Experimental support for the existence of two distinct transcription units is provided by our observation that {RNA} in situ hybridization with a probe for {IR75c} ({CG14586}-A) highlights only a subset of cells labeled by a probe for {IR75b} ({CG14586}-B) (Figure {3F}). For most {IRs}, verification of the computationally predicted protein sequences awaits isolation of full-length {cDNAs}. Thus, the phylogenetic relationships illustrated in Figure {1B} and sequence alignments in Figure {1C} and Figure 2 should not be considered definitive. Gene {NomenclatureIdentified} genes were named by applying the same conventions adopted for the {OR} and {GR} gene families (Drosophila Odorant Receptor Nomenclature Committee, 2000). In brief, genes are named according to their location within one of the 102 primary numbered cytogenetic units of the 
Drosophila genome. Where there is only one candidate receptor within a given numbered region, it is appended with a lowercase  ” a”; where there are multiple receptors within a region, these are supplied with lowercase letters as a unique identifier according to their relative position on the cytogenetic map. Sequence Alignments and Phylogenetic {AnalysisAlignments} of specific domains of {iGluRs}/{IRs} were generated with {ClustalW}, with manual adjustments, and were visualized in Jalview (Clamp et al., 2004). The phylogenetic tree was generated by aligning full length sequences with {PROBCONS} (Do et al., 2005) and tree inference with {RAxML} (Stamatakis, 2006). The tree was viewed with {FigTree} v1.1.2. Molecular {BiologyFor} {RT}-{PCR} analysis of {IR} expression, {cDNA} was synthesized from Drosophila tissues with the Absolutely {RNA} Microprep Kit (Stratagene) and Superscript {First-Strand} Synthesis System (Invitrogen). Gene-specific primers for {PCR} were designed with Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.
edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3\_www.cgi/) to amplify 500 bp spanning, where possible, at least one intron. Primer pairs were verified for their ability to amplify products from genomic {DNA} with Taq {DNA} polymerase (Invitrogen). {DNA} templates for antisense probe synthesis were generated by {T:A} cloning {cDNA} or genomic {PCR} products for each {IR} gene into {pGEM}-T Easy (Promega). Antisense Digoxygenin ({DIG})-, Fluorescein-, or Biotin-labeled {RNA} probes were synthesized via standard methods. Details of transgene construction are provided in the Supplemental Data available online. Drosophila {StocksDrosophila} stocks were maintained on conventional cornmeal-agar-molasses medium under a 12 hr light:12 hr dark cycle at {25°C}. {Oregon-R} was used as a wild-type control. Previously described mutant alleles and transgenic lines used are listed in the Supplemental Data. Transgenic lines were generated in this study by Genetic Services Inc. (Cambridge, {MA}) with either P-element-mediated transformation or, 
for {UAS}-{IR84a}, the {phiC31}-based integration system (Bischof et al., 2007). Gene targeting of {IR25a} was performed essentially as described (Larsson et al., 2004), with nine independent insertions of the targeting construct. From approximately 150,000 F2 progeny, two null mutants were obtained, which were confirmed by {PCR} on genomic {DNA} preparations from homozygous mutant animals. Histology and {ImmunocytochemistryIn} situ {RNA} hybridization was performed essentially as described (Fishilevich and Vosshall, 2005) with combinations of Fluorescein-, {DIG}-, and Biotin-labeled {RNA} probes, which were visualized with the {TSA} Plus Fluorescein, Cy5, or Cy3 Fluorescence Systems (Perkin Elmer), respectively. Immunofluorescence on antennal sections or whole-mount brains was performed as described (Benton et al., 2006). Previously described antibodies are listed in the Supplemental Data. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against {IR25a} were raised against the synthetic peptides {SKAALRPRFNQYPATFKPRF} and {
DVAEANAERSNAADHPGKLVDGV} and affinity-purified by Proteintech Group, Inc (Chicago) and used at 1:1000. Electrophysiology and {OdorantsExtracellular} recordings in single sensilla of 2- to 8-day-old flies were performed as described (Jones et al., 2007). Odorants were obtained from {Sigma-Aldrich} at high purity. Chemical Abstracts Service ({CAS}) numbers are as follows: aqueous ammonia (ammonium hydroxide) (1336-21-6), 1,4-diaminobutane (110-60-1), propanal (123-38-6), hexanol (111-27-3), propionic acid (79-09-4), phenylacetaldehyde (122-78-1), and phenylacetonitrile (140-29-4). Odors were used at 1\% (v/v in solvent) unless indicated otherwise in the figures, diluted either in paraffin oil (propanal, hexanol, phenylacetaldehyde, phenylacetonitrile) or water (ammonium hydroxide, propionic acid, 1,4-diaminobutane). The onset of odor responses varied slightly (usually <200 ms) between animals of the same genotype recorded on different days, most likely because of small variations in the position of the odor 
delivery apparatus relative to the preparation. For quantification of responses, we determined the time of onset of the response of a control wild-type sensillum to either propionic acid (for ac3) or phenylacetaldehyde (for ac4) for each recording session. Corrected responses for all recordings in the same session were quantified by counting spikes in a 0.5 s window from this time point, subtracting the number of spontaneous spikes in a 0.5 s window prior to stimulation, and doubling the result to obtain spikes/s. We summed spikes from all neurons in a given sensillum because of difficulties in reliable spike sorting in coeloconic sensilla (Yao et al., 2005). After verifying that responses were normally distributed, we compared all genotypes for a given stimulus by {ANOVA}, with genotype as the main effect, followed by post hoc t tests. {AcknowledgmentsWe} thank Andrew Jarman, Hugo Bellen, the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center, and the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank for Drosophila strains and

@article{citeulike:5969737,
    abstract = { In the fruit fly Drosophila, not all olfactory sensory neurons express a seven transmembrane odorant receptor, suggesting that other types of odorant receptors might exist. Benton et al. (2009) now present evidence that a family of proteins related to ionotropic glutamate receptors is a previously unrecognized class of odorant receptors. Main {TextOdor} detection is accomplished by odorant receptors, originally identified in rodents as a large family of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}). Odorant receptors have subsequently been found in fish and nematodes, and eventually in the fruit fly Drosophila (Bargmann, 2006). Surprisingly, Drosophila seven transmembrane odorant receptors ({ORs}) were recently found to have inverted membrane topology compared to typical {GPCRs}, with their N terminus facing the cytoplasm rather than the extracellular space (Benton et al., 2006). Additionally, Drosophila {ORs} require Or83b, another seven transmembrane protein highly conserved in 
insects, as an obligate coreceptor (Larsson et al., 2004). Indeed, evidence suggests that {OR}/Or83b complexes form ligand-gated ion channels ([Sato et al., 2008] and [Wicher et al., 2008]), a striking difference to {GPCRs} in worms and vertebrates that rely on second messengers to activate ion channels. In this issue, Benton et al. (2009) report the identification of a new class of odorant receptors that are related to ionotropic glutamate receptors, thus expanding the known repertoire of odorant receptors beyond the classical family of seven transmembrane {receptors.In} the Drosophila olfactory system, olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs}, also known as olfactory receptor neurons or {ORNs}) located in the antennae and maxillary palps send axons to the antennal lobe in the central brain. {OSN} dendrites are present in sensory organs called sensilla, where they are exposed to the environment, and the different types of sensilla (basiconic, coeloconic, and trichoid) respond to different types of odorants (Figure 
1). Just as in the mammalian olfactory system, most Drosphila {OSNs} express a single {OR}, and {OSN} axons expressing the same {OR} converge on the same glomerulus in the antennal lobe (Vosshall and Stocker, 2007). Nearly every {OR} has been genetically mapped for its expression in specific sensilla and for its corresponding {OSN} axon projection to a specific glomerulus (Couto et al., 2005). With one exception, all {ORs} are expressed in basiconic and trichoid {OSNs}. Or35a is expressed in coeloconic {OSNs} which project to only one of eight glomeruli predicted to be targets of coeloconic {OSNs}. Exhaustive study of {ORs} and gustatory receptors (two gustatory receptors are coexpressed in {CO2}-sensing {OSNs}, see Figure 1) still leaves most coeloconic {OSNs} unaccounted for with regard to the identity of the odorant receptors they express (Couto et al., 2005). This indicated that an unidentified class of odorant receptors could be present in most coeloconic {OSNs}. Benton et al. (2009) now present 
convincing evidence that a family of proteins related to ionotropic glutamate receptors fill this role. Benton et al. identified this family of receptors, which they named ionotropic receptors ({IRs}), in a bioinformatic screen for genes expressed in the fly antennae. Subsequent {BLAST} searches revealed a family of 61 genes in Drosophila. Despite having a similar modular organization to the ionotropic glutamate receptors extensively studied for their role in synaptic transmission, such as {AMPA} and {NMDA} receptors, the {IRs} show wide divergence at the sequence level and in particular show considerable variations in residues known to be important for glutamate binding. Thus, these {IRs} are unlikely to be glutamate receptors, but may instead bind other {ligands.Multiple} lines of evidence indicate that {IRs} are indeed the missing coeloconic odorant receptors. First, {mRNAs} of 15 {IRs} are specifically expressed in neurons of the adult antenna. Second, an antibody that specifically recognized one {IR} 
protein stained the dendrites of {OSNs}, consistent with a role in odor detection. Third, the {IR}-positive {OSNs} are distinct from Or83b-expressing {OSNs}, as assayed by double in situ analysis (with the exception of coeloconic {OSNs} coexpressing {Or35a/Or83b}/Ir76b). Fourth, in mutants that disrupt coeloconic sensilla development, {IR} expression is lost. Fifth, {IR} expression maps into four clusters of neurons corresponding to the four coeloconic sensilla types previously characterized physiologically (Yao et al., 2005). Sixth, just as {OSNs} expressing a common {OR} project their axons to a single glomerulus, axons labeled by {Ir76a-GAL4} converge to a single glomerulus previously identified as having coeloconic input. Finally, misexpression of {IRs} is sufficient to bestow new odor sensitivity to coeloconic {OSNs}, indicating that {IRs} determine odor {specificity.There} appear to be important organizational differences between {OSNs} that express {IRs} and those that express {ORs}. Multiple {IRs} 
can be coexpressed per neuron, which is strikingly different than {OR} expression, which generally follows a one neuron-one receptor rule. This may reflect a functional requirement for more than one {IR} to form a functional channel. {NMDA} receptors, for instance, are a tetramer composed of different subunits. Although Ir76a axons target a single glomerulus, this may not be a general rule, as Ir76a is one of the few {IRs} expressed in a single class of coeloconic {OSNs}. The odor responses of {IR}-expressing {OSNs} may be defined by expression of a particular set of {IRs} rather than a single {IR} gene, so a given {IR} may label axons projecting to multiple {glomeruli.These} important results by Benton et al. lend themselves to several lines of future study. Biologically, the identification of {IRs} should allow comprehensive mapping of odor specificity and glomerular projection of specific {IR}-expressing {OSNs}. It is already known that a division of labor exists between the trichoid sensilla that 
putatively sense pheromones and the basiconic sensilla that sense food odorants, and this division is even propagated to higher olfactory centers (Jefferis et al., 2007). Future studies will determine whether coeloconic {OSNs} have particular odor specialties and how this information is represented in the brain. Mechanistically, it is important to extend the sufficiency test beyond ectopic expression of {IRs} in other coeloconic {OSNs}. For instance, reconstituting the odor response in ectopic cells such as Xenopus oocytes would allow the dissection of biochemical and biophysical properties of the {IR} receptor/channel {complex.The} identification of {IRs} as odorant receptors also raises interesting evolutionary questions. Ionotropic glutamate receptors at synapses and {IRs} in odor detection both function by sensing molecules in the extracellular environment, an ancient faculty dating back to prokaryotes (Bargmann, 2006). Various families of  ” chemosensors” may have been coopted numerous times through 
evolution for purposes as diverse as olfaction, immunity, and neurotransmission. A second consideration is the difference between olfaction in insects and other animals, namely that insect odorant receptors could function independently from second messengers. Whether this distinction allows some evolutionary advantage, such as a more rapid signaling, is yet to be determined. One thing is certain: insights from Drosophila olfaction continue to yield surprises while deepening our understanding of general biological principles. },

    abstract = {G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}) constitute a large superfamily involved in various types of signal transduction pathways triggered by hormones, odorants, peptides, proteins, and other types of ligands. The superfamily is so diverse that many members lack sequence similarity, although they all span the cell membrane seven times with an extracellular N and a cytosolic C terminus. We analyzed a divergent set of {GPCRs} and found distinct loop length patterns and differences in amino acid composition between cytosolic loops, extracellular loops, and membrane regions. We configured {GPCRHMM}, a hidden Markov model, to fit those features and trained it on a large dataset representing the entire superfamily. {GPCRHMM} was benchmarked to profile {HMMs} and generic transmembrane detectors on sets of known {GPCRs} and {non-GPCRs}. In a cross-validation procedure, profile {HMMs} produced an error rate nearly twice as high as {GPCRHMM}. In a sensitivity-selectivity test, {GPCRHMM}'s sensitivity was 
about 15\% higher than that of the best transmembrane predictors, at comparable false positive rates. We used {GPCRHMM} to search for novel members of the {GPCR} superfamily in five proteomes. All in all we detected 120 sequences that lacked annotation and are potentially novel {GPCRs}. Out of those 102 were found in Caenorhabditis elegans, four in human, and seven in mouse. Many predictions (65) belonged to Pfam domains of unknown function. {GPCRHMM} strongly rejected a family of arthropod-specific odorant receptors believed to be {GPCRs}. A detailed analysis showed that these sequences are indeed very different from other {GPCRs}. {GPCRHMM} is available at http://gpcrhmm.cgb.ki.se.},

    abstract = {Drosophila olfactory sensory neurons ({OSNs}) each express two odorant receptors ({ORs}): a divergent member of the {OR} family and the highly conserved, broadly expressed receptor {OR83b}. {OR83b} is essential for olfaction in vivo and enhances {OR} function in vitro, but the molecular mechanism by which it acts is unknown. Here we demonstrate that {OR83b} heterodimerizes with conventional {ORs} early in the endomembrane system in {OSNs}, couples these complexes to the conserved ciliary trafficking pathway, and is essential to maintain the {OR}/{OR83b} complex within the sensory cilia, where odor signal transduction occurs. The {OR}/{OR83b} complex is necessary and sufficient to promote functional reconstitution of odor-evoked signaling in sensory neurons that normally respond only to carbon dioxide. Unexpectedly, unlike all known vertebrate and nematode chemosensory receptors, we find that Drosophila {ORs} and {OR83b} adopt a novel membrane topology with their N-termini and the most 
conserved loops in the cytoplasm. These loops mediate direct association of {ORs} with {OR83b}. Our results reveal that {OR83b} is a universal and integral part of the functional {OR} in Drosophila . This atypical heteromeric and topological design appears to be an insect-specific solution for odor recognition, making the {OR}/{OR83b} complex an attractive target for the development of highly selective insect repellents to disrupt olfactory-mediated host-seeking behaviors of insect disease vectors.},

                The mammalian olfactory system can recognize and discriminate a large number of different odorant molecules. The detection of chemically distinct odorants presumably results from the association of odorous ligands with specific receptors on olfactory sensory neurons. To address the problem of olfactory perception at a molecular level, we have cloned and characterized 18 different members of an extremely large multigene family that encodes seven transmembrane domain proteins whose expression is restricted to the olfactory epithelium. The members of this novel gene family are likely to encode a diverse family of odorant receptors.

As such it is of great value to understand the interplay of the molecular components of the olfactory system which, in addition to fostering a better understanding of insect neurobiology, may ultimately aid in devising novel intervention strategies to reduce disease transmission or crop damage. Since the first discovery of odorant receptors in vertebrates over a decade ago, much of our view on how the insect olfactory system might work has been derived from observations made in vertebrates and other invertebrates, such as lobsters or nematodes. Together with the advantages of a wide range of genetic tools, the identification of the first insect odorant receptors in Drosophila melanogaster in 1999 paved the way for rapid progress in unraveling the question of how olfactory signal transduction and processing 
occurs in the fruitfly. This review intends to summarize much of this progress and to point out some areas where advances can be expected in the near future.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Roche 454 pyrosequencing has become a method of choice for generating transcriptome data from non-model organisms. Once the tens to hundreds of thousands of short (250-450 base) reads have been produced, it is important to correctly assemble these to estimate the sequence of all the transcripts. Most transcriptome assembly projects use only one program for assembling 454 pyrosequencing reads, but there is no evidence that the programs used to date are optimal. We have carried out a systematic comparison of five assemblers ({CAP3}, {MIRA}, Newbler, {SeqMan} and {CLC}) to establish best practices for transcriptome assemblies, using a new dataset from the parasitic nematode Litomosoides {sigmodontis.RESULTS}:Although no single assembler performed best on all our criteria, Newbler 2.5 gave longer contigs, better alignments to some reference sequences, and was fast and easy to use. {SeqMan} assemblies performed best on the criterion of recapitulating known transcripts, and had more 
novel sequence than the other assemblers, but generated an excess of small, redundant contigs. The remaining assemblers all performed almost as well, with the exception of Newbler 2.3 (the version currently used by most assembly projects), which generated assemblies that had significantly lower total length. As different assemblers use different underlying algorithms to generate contigs, we also explored merging of assemblies and found that the merged datasets not only aligned better to reference sequences than individual assemblies, but were also more consistent in the number and size of {contigs.CONCLUSIONS}:Transcriptome assemblies are smaller than genome assemblies and thus should be more computationally tractable, but are often harder because individual contigs can have highly variable read coverage. Comparing single assemblers, Newbler 2.5 performed best on our trial data set, but other assemblers were closely comparable. Combining differently optimal assemblies from different programs however gave a 
more credible final product, and this strategy is recommended.},

    abstract = {Male moths are endowed with odorant receptors ({ORs}) to detect species-specific sex pheromones with remarkable sensitivity and selectivity. We serendipitously discovered that an endogenous {OR} in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, is highly sensitive to the sex pheromone of the silkworm moth, bombykol. Intriguingly, the fruit fly detectors are more sensitive than the receptors of the silkworm moth, although its ecological significance is unknown. By expression in the  ” empty neuron” system, we identified the fruit fly bombykol-sensitive {OR} as {DmelOR7a} (= {DmOR7a}). The profiles of this receptor in response to bombykol in the native sensilla (ab4) or expressed in the empty neuron system (ab3 sensilla) are indistinguishable. Both {WT} and transgenic flies responded with high sensitivity, in a dose-dependent manner, and with rapid signal termination. In contrast, the same empty neuron expressing the moth bombykol receptor, {BmorOR1}, demonstrated low sensitivity and slow signal 
inactivation. When expressed in the trichoid sensilla T1 of the fruit fly, the neuron housing {BmorOR1} responded with sensitivity comparable to that of the native trichoid sensilla in the silkworm moth. By challenging the native bombykol receptor in the fruit fly with high doses of another odorant to which the receptor responds with the highest sensitivity, we demonstrate that slow signal termination is induced by overdose of a stimulus. As opposed to the empty neuron system in the basiconic sensilla, the structural, biochemical, and/or biophysical features of the sensilla make the T1 trichoid system of the fly a better surrogate for the moth receptor.},

Understanding the nature of the relationship between the sizes of these products has become significant due to various reasons. One major reason is the ability to predict the size of the later phase products by using the sizes of early life cycle products. For example, we need to predict the Source Lines of Code ({SLOC}) from Function Points ({FP}) since {SLOC} is being used as the main input for most of the estimation models when this measure is not available yet. {SLOC}/{FP} ratios have been used by the industry for such purposes even though the assumed linear relationship has not been validated yet. Similarly, {FP} has recently started to be used to predict the Bytes of code for estimating the amount of spare memory needed in systems. In this paper, we aim to investigate further the nature of the relationship between the software functional size 
and the code size by conducting a series of empirical studies.},

    abstract = {Odorant receptors comprise a unique family of G-protein-coupled seven-transmembrane receptors both in mammals and insects. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, all 61 candidate odorant receptor genes have been identified based on the complete genome sequence, and their expression patterns have been examined. A given odorant receptor is expressed in the antenna or maxillary palp, or not expressed at all. Here we have applied a set of statistical analyses to the length of the extra- and intracellular loops and terminals ({LTs}) of Drosophila odorant receptors to examine possible inter- and intramolecular relations at the population level. We have first provided some useful statistical information such as mean length values and length histograms to depict a general nature of Drosophila odorant receptors at the population level, after focusing on discrepancy on assigning transmembrane domains between researchers. In a preferable transmembrane assignment, all extracellular {LTs}, especially 
the second extracellular loops, were relatively large in length, suggesting their functional significance. Somewhat surprisingly, principle component analysis ({PCA}) indicated that the maxillary palp receptors were almost as diverse as the antenna receptors despite their much smaller population size. {PCA} together with histograms also revealed that receptors with an abnormal length configuration tended not to be expressed, suggesting that {LT} length deviations are related to transcriptional silencing of odorant receptor genes. Rank transformation tests pointed out possible {LTs} that could have different length between differently expressed receptors at the population level. Taken together, length analyses provide us with a general picture, i.e.  ” length configuration,” of Drosophila odorant receptors at the population level that could point out putatively important functional sites for experimental studies.},

@article{citeulike:8484507,
    abstract = { In 1999, three groups independently identified a large family of candidate Drosophila odorant receptor genes ([2, 3 and 5]). These genes encode novel seven transmembrane domain receptor proteins that are selectively expressed in subsets of olfactory receptor neurons in the fruit fly. A total of 19 candidate odorant receptors were described in the initial reports, and these were named according to three different nomenclature systems, resulting in multiple names for a given receptor. With the recent completion of the euchromatic genome sequence of Drosophila ([1 and 4]), the number of identified genes with homology to the candidate odorant receptors has increased to a total of 60. These have been annotated by Celera Genomics in collaboration with the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project using a fourth nomenclature system. To address this nomenclature problem, representatives of several laboratories met at the Association for Chemoreception Sciences meeting held in Sarasota, Florida, in April, 
2000. Subsequently, representatives of {FlyBase} were consulted for their assistance in unifying the nomenclature. As a result of these discussions, a Drosophila Odorant Receptor Nomenclature Committee was formed to systematize and unify the Drosophila odorant receptor nomenclature. Table 1 presents a summary of the proposed nomenclature, which has recently been endorsed by a number of scientists working in the field. Rationale of the {SystemGenes} in Drosophila are typically named to convey functional information, usually reflecting a mutant phenotype. When mutants are not available, the gene name instead often conveys information about chromosomal position. The Drosophila genome has been divided into 102 numbered segments, based on characteristic banding patterns visible on polytene chromosomes. The cytogenetic positions of the 60 odorant receptors have been inferred by linkage to known mapped genes, but have not been precisely determined. Recognizing this inherent uncertainty, yet desiring to convey 
positional information in the unified nomenclature, the Committee proposes that each Drosophila odorant receptor be named according to its location within the primary numbered cytogenetic units. Where there is only one candidate receptor within a given numbered region, it is appended with the small letter  ” a.” In cases where there are multiple receptors within a numbered region, these are supplied with a small letter as a unique identifier according to relative position on the cytogenetic map. For instance, the two odorant receptors in division 43 on the second chromosome are named Or43a and Or43b, corresponding to map positions {43A1} and {43F5}, respectively. In accordance with nomenclature standards developed by {FlyBase}, the letter  ” D” for Drosophila has been eliminated from the name and the generic symbol  ” Or,” for odorant receptor substituted. The benefit of this naming scheme is that general cytogenetic information is conveyed, thereby localizing receptors to within approximately 1\% of the 
genome. The omission of more specific number and letter subdivisions in the nomenclature insulates the new names from readjustments of cytological positions of Drosophila genes that will undoubtedly occur as more accurate alignments between the cytogenetic map and genomic sequence are {made.Naming} New {SequencesA} total of 60 Drosophila odorant receptors have been identified and named by members of the Committee. In the eventuality that additional genes are discovered, these should be named according to the scheme described above. Where possible, the assistance of {FlyBase} (flybase-help@morgan.harvard.edu) should be sought. Additional information on the odorant receptors in the fly genome is available at web sites maintained by {FlyBase} (http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu), the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (http://www.fruitfly.org), and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). We recommend that this nomenclature be used in future publications. },

    abstract = {For most organisms, chemosensation is critical for survival and is mediated by large families of chemoreceptor proteins, whose expression must be tuned appropriately to changes in the chemical environment. We asked whether expression of chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the genome would be regulated independently; whether expression of certain chemoreceptor genes would be especially sensitive to environmental changes; whether groups of chemoreceptor genes undergo coordinated rexpression; and how plastic the expression of chemoreceptor genes is with regard to sex, development, reproductive state, and social context. To answer these questions we used Drosophila melanogaster , because its chemosensory systems are well characterized and both the genotype and environment can be controlled precisely. Using customized {cDNA} microarrays, we showed that chemoreceptor genes that are clustered in the genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and 
between sexes. Expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions. Furthermore, exposure of flies only to odor of the opposite sex results in altered transcript abundance of chemoreceptor genes. These genes are distinct from those that show transcriptional plasticity when flies are allowed physical contact with same or opposite sex members. We analyzed covariance in transcript abundance of chemosensory genes across all environmental conditions and found that they segregated into 20 relatively small, biologically relevant modules of highly correlated transcripts. This finely pixilated modular organization of the chemosensory subgenome enables fine tuning of the expression of the chemoreceptor repertoire in response to ecologically relevant environmental and physiological conditions.},

Some of these genes are present in large clusters in the genome. Most members are expressed in various taste organs, including gustatory sensilla in the labellum, the pharyngeal labral sense organ, dorsal and ventral cibarial organs, as well as taste bristles located on the wings and tarsi. Some of the gustatory {OBPs} are expressed exclusively in taste organs, but most are expressed in both olfactory and gustatory sensilla. Multiple binding proteins can be coexpressed in the same gustatory sensillum. Cells in the tarsi that express {OBPs} are required for normal chemosensation mediated through the leg, as ablation of these cells dramatically reduces the sensitivity of the proboscis extension reflex to sucrose. Finally, we show that {OBP} genes expressed in the pharyngeal taste sensilla are still expressed in the poxneuro genetic background while {OBPs} expressed in the 
labellum are not. These findings support a broad role for members of the {OBP} family in gustation and olfaction and suggest that poxneuro is required for cell fate determination of labellar but not pharyngeal taste organs.},

    abstract = {Olfaction is of considerable importance to many insects in behaviors critical for survival and reproduction, including location of food sources, selection of mates, recognition of colony con-specifics, and determination of oviposition sites. An ubiquitous, but poorly understood, component of the insect's olfactory system is a group of odorant-binding proteins ({OBPs}) that are present at high concentrations in the aqueous lymph surrounding the dendrites of olfactory receptor neurons. {OBPs} are believed to shuttle odorants from the environment to the underlying odorant receptors, for which they could potentially serve as odorant presenters. Here we show that the Drosophila genome carries 51 potential {OBP} genes, a number comparable to that of its odorant-receptor genes. We find that the majority (73\%) of these {OBP}-like genes occur in clusters of as many as nine genes, in contrast to what has been observed for the Drosophila odorant-receptor genes. Two of the presumptive {OBP} gene 
clusters each carries an odorant-receptor gene. We also report an intriguing subfamily of 12 putative {OBPs} that share a unique C-terminal structure with three conserved cysteines and a conserved proline. Members of this subfamily have not previously been described for any insect. We have performed phylogenetic analyses of the {OBP}-related proteins in Drosophila as well as other insects, and we discuss the duplication and divergence of the genes for this large family. [The sequence data from this study have been submitted to {FlyBase}. Annotations for these sequences are available as supplementary material at http://www.genome.org.]},

However, new challenges of distinguishing the individual activities involved in software evolution arise when considering collaborative development environments. Since Software repositories such as version control systems ({VCS}) and bug tracking systems ({BTS}) are available for most software projects and hold a detailed and rich record of the historical development information, this paper presents our experiences mining individual performance indicators in collaborative development environments by using these repositories. The base of our key idea is to identify the complexity metrics (in the code base) and field defects(from bug tracking system) at individual-level by incorporating the historical data from version control system. We also remotely measure and analyze these indicators mined from a libre 
project {jEdit}, which involves around one hundred developer. The results show that these indicators are feasible and instructive in the understanding of the individual performance.},

    abstract = {Candidate olfactory receptors of the moth Heliothis virescens were found to be extremely diverse from receptors of the fruitfly Drosophila melanogaster and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, but there is one exception. The moth receptor type {HR2} shares a rather high degree of sequence identity with one olfactory receptor type both from Drosophila (Dor83b) and from Anopheles ({AgamGPRor7}); moreover, in contrast to all other receptors, this unique receptor type is expressed in numerous antennal neurons. Here we describe the identification of {HR2} homologues in two further lepidopteran species, the moths Antheraea pernyi and Bombyx mori, which share 86–88\% of their amino acids. In addition, based on {RT}-{PCR} experiments {HR2} homologues were discovered in antennal {cDNA} of the honey bee (Apis mellifera; Hymenoptera), the blowfly (Calliphora erythrocephala; Diptera) and the mealworm (Tenebrio molitor; Coleoptera). Comparison of all {HR2}-related receptors revealed a high degree of sequence 
conservation across insect orders. In situ hybridization of antennal sections from the bee and the blowfly support the notion that {HR2}-related receptors are generally expressed in a very large number of antennal cells. This, together with the high degree of conservation suggests that this unique receptor subtype may fulfill a special function in chemosensory neurons of insects.},

Thus, a developer often examines a sequence of its snapshots stored in repositories of versioning systems, and identifies differences between two successive snapshots. Unfortunately, such differences do not represent individual changes of the source code. This paper proposes a mechanism for recording all editing operations a developer has applied to source code on an integrated development environment. The paper also shows a running implementation of the mechanism built as an Eclipse plug-in, which is called {OperationRecorder}. The experimental results with a small-scale program substantiate that it has a practical use from the viewpoint of its performance.},

    abstract = {Software engineering process information extracted from version control systems and bug tracking databases are widely used in empirical software engineering. In prior work, we showed that these data are plagued by quality deficiencies, which vary in its characteristics across projects. In addition, we showed that those deficiencies in the form of bias do impact the results of studies in empirical software engineering. While these findings affect software engineering researchers the impact on practitioners has not yet been substantiated. In this paper we, therefore, explore (i) if the process data quality and characteristics have an influence on the bug fixing process and (ii) if the process quality as measured by the process data has an influence on the product (i.e., software) quality. Specifically, we analyze six Open Source as well as two Closed Source projects and show that process data quality and characteristics have an impact on the bug fixing process: the high rate of empty commit 
messages in Eclipse, for example, correlates with the bug report quality. We also show that the product quality - measured by number of bugs reported - is affected by process data quality measures. These findings have the potential to prompt practitioners to increase the quality of their software process and its associated data quality.},

Smaller companies and those operating in development areas where speed of delivery is paramount have not, as yet, had process improvement paradigms available for adoption.},

    abstract = {Abstract Insect odorant receptors are a large family of seven transmembrane proteins believed to be G-protein coupled receptors. The peptide sequences of two odorant receptors within a given species may share as little as 17\% identity, and there is limited similarity between receptors of divergent species. One exception is {DmOr83b}, which is found in Drosophila melanogaster and is highly conserved in at least ten other insect species. {DmOr83b} is broadly expressed in most of the olfactory sensory neurons of D. melanogaster at most developmental stages, while other odorant receptors tend to have more restricted and specific expression patterns. {DmOr83b} is critical for D. melanogaster olfaction, and it is involved in properly localizing other odorant receptors possibly by forming heterodimers with these receptors. The C-terminal region has been implicated as sites for such heterodimer formation. Multiple em for motif elicitation ({MEME}), a hidden markov model based program, was used to 
uncover three conserved motifs in the C-termini of a vast majority of the odorant receptor peptides from Anopheles gambiae, D. melanogaster, and Apis mellifera. These motifs are also found in {DmOr83b} and its orthologs and the order of these motifs is conserved as well. The conservation of these motifs among divergent odorant receptors in divergent species suggests functional importance. We propose that these motifs are involved in receptor- receptor protein interactions, contributing to the heterodimer formation between {DmOr83b} (or its orthologs) and other odorant receptors.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The olfactory system plays an important role in the recognition of leaf volatiles during the search of folivore insects for a suitable plant host. For example, volatiles emitted by mulberry leaves trigger chemotaxis behavior in the silkworms Bombyx mori, and as a consequence, they preferentially reside on and consume mulberry leaves. Here, we aimed to identify natural chemoattractants and their corresponding olfactory receptors (Ors) involved in silkworm behavior to mulberry leaves. {RESULTS}: Chemotaxis behavioral assays for headspace volatiles detected by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy analysis revealed that among the volatiles that were emitted by mulberry leaves, cis-jasmone was the most potent attractant for silkworms, working at a threshold of 0.3 pg from a 20 cm distance. Among a total of 66 Ors identified in the B. mori genome, we found that 23 were expressed in the olfactory organs during larval stages. Functional analysis of all the larvae-expressed Ors in 
Xenopus oocytes revealed that one Or, termed {BmOr}-56, showed a high sensitivity to cis-jasmone. In addition, the ligand-receptor activity of {BmOr}-56 reflected the chemotaxis behavioral response of silkworms. {CONCLUSIONS}: We identified cis-jasmone as a potent attractant in mulberry leaves for silkworms and provide evidence that a highly tuned receptor, {BmOr}-56, may mediate this behavioral attraction. The current study sheds light on the mechanism of the correlation between olfactory perception in folivore insects and chemotaxis behavior to a natural volatile emitted by green leaves.},

    abstract = {Abstract Olfaction plays an important role in the life history of insects, including key behaviours such as host selection, oviposition and mate recognition. Odour perception by insects is primarily mediated by the large diverse family of odourant receptors (Ors) that are expressed on the dendrites of olfactory neurones housed within chemosensilla. However, few Or sequences have been identified from the Lepidoptera, an insect order that includes some of the most important pest species worldwide. We have identified 41 Or gene sequences from the silkworm (Bombyx mori) genome, more than double the number of published Or sequences from the Lepidoptera. Many silkworm Ors appear to be orthologs of the 17 published tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens) Ors indicating that many Or lineages may be conserved within the Lepidoptera. The majority of the Or genes are expressed in adult female and male antennae (determined by quantitative real-time {PCR} analysis), supporting their probable roles in adult 
olfaction. Several Or genes are expressed at high levels in both male and female antennae, suggesting they mediate the perception of common host or conspecific volatiles important to both sexes. {BmOrs} 45–47 group together in the same phylogenetic branch and all three are expressed at moderate female-biased ratios, six to eight times higher in female compared to male moth antennae. Interestingly, {BmOrs19} and 30 appear to be expressed predominantly in female antennae, opposite to that of the published silkworm pheromone receptors {BmOrs} 1 and 3 that are specific to male antennae. These results suggest that {BmOr19} and 30 may detect odours critical to female behaviour, such as oviposition cues or male-produced courtship pheromones.},

    abstract = {The honey bee genome sequence reveals a remarkable expansion of the insect odorant receptor (Or) family relative to the repertoires of the flies Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, which have 62 and 79 Ors respectively. A total of 170 Or genes were annotated in the bee, of which seven are pseudogenes. These constitute five bee-specific subfamilies in an insect Or family tree, one of which has expanded to a total of 157 genes encoding proteins with 15\%-99 amino acid identity. Most of the Or genes are in tandem arrays, including one with 60 genes. This bee-specific expansion of the Or repertoire presumably underlies their remarkable olfactory abilities, including perception of several pheromone blends, kin recognition signals, and diverse floral odors. The number of Apis mellifera Ors is approximately equal to the number of glomeruli in the bee antennal lobe (160-170), consistent with a general one-receptor/one-neuron/one-glomerulus relationship. The bee genome encodes just 10 
gustatory receptors (Grs) compared with the D. melanogaster and A. gambiae repertoires of 68 and 76 Grs, respectively. A lack of Gr gene family expansion primarily accounts for this difference. A nurturing hive environment and a mutualistic relationship with plants may explain the lack of Gr family expansion. The Or family is the most dramatic example of gene family expansion in the bee genome, and characterizing their caste- and sex-specific gene expression may provide clues to their specific roles in detection of pheromone, kin, and floral odors.},

    abstract = {{PMID}: 12627966 The α-factor receptor of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoded by the {STE2} gene is a member of the large family of G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}) that mediate multiple signal transduction pathways. The third intracellular loop of {GPCRs} has been identified as a likely site of interaction with G proteins. To determine the extent of allowed substitutions within this loop, we subjected a stretch of 21 amino acids ({Leu228−Leu248}) to intensive random mutagenesis and screened multiply substituted alleles for receptor function. The 91 partially functional mutant alleles that were recovered contained 96 unique amino acid substitutions. Every position in this region can be replaced with at least two other types of amino acids without a significant effect on function. The tolerance for nonconservative substitutions indicates that activation of the G protein by ligand-bound receptors involves multiple intramolecular interactions that do not strongly depend on particular 
sequence elements. Many of the functional mutant alleles exhibit greater than normal levels of signaling, consistent with an inhibitory role for the third intracellular loop. Removal of increasing numbers of positively charged residues from the loop by site-directed mutagenesis causes a progressive loss of signaling function, indicating that the overall net charge of the loop is important for receptor function. Introduction of negatively charged residues also leads to a reduced level of signaling. The defects in signaling caused by substitution of charged amino acids are not caused by changes in the abundance of receptors at the cell surface.},

    abstract = {{PMID}: 15667221 The α-factor receptor (Ste2p) stimulates mating of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ste2p belongs to the large family of G protein-coupled receptors that are characterized by seven transmembrane α-helices. Receptor activation is thought to involve changes in the packing of the transmembrane helix bundle. To identify residues that contribute to Ste2p activation, second-site suppressor mutations were isolated that restored function to defective receptors carrying either an {F204S} or {Y266C} substitution which affect residues at the extracellular ends of transmembrane domains 5 and 6, respectively. Thirty-five different suppressor mutations were identified. On their own, these mutations caused a range of phenotypes, including hypersensitivity, constitutive activity, altered ligand binding, and loss of function. The majority of the mutations affected residues in the transmembrane segments that are predicted to face the helix bundle. Many of the suppressor mutations caused 
constitutive receptor activity, suggesting they improved receptor function by partially restoring the balance between the active and inactive states. Analysis of mutations in transmembrane domain 7 implicated residues Ala281 and Thr282 in receptor activation. The {A281T} and {T282A} mutants were supersensitive to S. cerevisiae α-factor, but were defective in responding to a variant of α-factor produced by another species, Saccharomyces kluyveri. The {A281T} mutant also displayed 8.7-fold enhanced basal signaling. Interestingly, Ala281 and Thr282 are situated in approximately the same position as Lys296 in rhodopsin, which is covalently linked to retinal. These results suggest that transmembrane domain 7 plays a role in receptor activation in a wide range of G protein-coupled receptors from yeast to humans.},

We present a detailed structure−function comparison of the very divergent Class A and D receptors to address whether there is a common activation mechanism across the {GPCR} superfamily. The Class A and D receptors are represented by the vertebrate visual pigment rhodopsin and the yeast α-factor pheromone receptor Ste2, respectively. Conserved amino acids within each specific receptor class and amino acids where mutation alters receptor function were located in the structures of rhodopsin and Ste2 to assess whether there are functionally equivalent positions or regions within these receptors. We find several general similarities that are quite striking. First, strongly polar amino acids mediate helix interactions. Their mutation generally leads 
to loss of function or constitutive activity. Second, small and weakly polar amino acids facilitate tight helix packing. Third, proline is essential at similar positions in transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of both receptors.

    abstract = {Odorant receptors belong to class A of the G protein-coupled receptors ({GPCRs}) and detect a large number of structurally diverse odorant molecules. A recent structural bioinformatic analysis suggests that structural features are conserved across class A of {GPCRs} in spite of their low sequence identity. Based on this work, we have aligned the sequences of 29 {ORs} for which ligand binding data are available. Recent site-directed mutagenesis experiments on one such receptor ({MOR174}-9) provide information that helped to identify nine amino-acid residues involved in ligand binding. Our modeling provides a rationale for amino acids in equivalent positions in most of the odorant receptors considered and helps to identify other amino acids that could be important for ligand binding. Our findings are consistent with most of the previous models and allow predictions for site-directed mutagenesis experiments, which could also validate our model.},

Later, with the wide use of {SCM} systems and the public availability of primitive software process artifact trails, formal methods such as Petri Nets, State Machines and others have been applied to the problem of recurrent process discovery and control. Recent advances in metrics effort, increased use of continuous integration, and extensive documentation of the performed process make information-rich fine-grained software process artifacts trails available for analysis. This fine-grained data has the potential to shed new light on the software process.

    abstract = {Olfactory stimulation induces an odor-guided crawling behavior of Drosophila melanogaster larvae characterized by either an attractive or a repellent reaction. In order to understand the underlying processes leading to these orientations we stimulated single olfactory receptor neurons ({ORNs}) through photo-activation within an intact neuronal network. Using the {Gal4-UAS} system two light inducible proteins, the light-sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin-2 ({ChR}-2) or the light-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (Pacalpha) were expressed in all or in individual {ORNs} of the larval olfactory system. Blue light stimulation caused an activation of these neurons, ultimately producing the illusion of an odor stimulus. Larvae were tested in a phototaxis assay for their orientation toward or away from the light source. Here we show that activation of Pacalpha expressing {ORNs} bearing the receptors Or33b or Or45a in blind {norpA} mutant larvae induces a repellent behavior away from the light. 
Conversely, photo-activation of the majority of {ORNs} induces attraction towards the light. Interestingly, in wild type larvae two ligands of Or33b and Or45a, octyl acetate and propionic ethylester, respectively, have been found to cause an escape reaction. Therefore, we combined light and odor stimulation to analyze the function of Or33b and Or45a expressing {ORNs}. We show that the larval olfactory system contains a designated neuronal pathway for repellent odorants and that activation of a specific class of {ORNs} already determines olfactory avoidance behavior.},

    abstract = {{BACKGROUND}:Olfactory Receptors ({ORs}) form the largest multigene family in vertebrates. Their evolution and their expansion in the vertebrate genomes was the subject of many studies. In this paper we apply a motif-based approach to this problem in order to uncover evolutionary {characteristics.RESULTS}:We extract deterministic motifs from {ORs} belonging to ten species using the {MEX} (Motif Extraction) algorithm, thus defining Common Peptides ({CPs}) characteristic to {ORs}. We identify species-specific {CPs} and show that their relative abundance is high only in fish and frog, suggesting relevance to water-soluble odorants. We estimate the origins of {CPs} according to the tree of life and track the gains and losses of {CPs} through evolution. We identify major {CP} gain in tetrapods and major losses in reptiles. Although the number of human {ORs} is less than half of the number of {ORs} in other mammals, the fraction of lost {CPs} is only {11\%.By} examining the positions of {CPs} along 
the {OR} sequence, we find two regions that expanded only in tetrapods. Using {CPs} we are able to establish remote homology relations between {ORs} and {non-OR} {GPCRs}.Selecting {CPs} according to their evolutionary age, we bicluster {ORs} and {CPs} for each species. Clean biclustering emerges when using relatively novel {CPs}. Evolutionary age is used to track the history of {CP} acquisition in the collection of mammalian {OR} families within {HORDE} (Human Olfactory Receptor Data {Explorer).CONCLUSION}:The {CP} method provides a novel perspective that reveals interesting traits in the evolution of olfactory receptors. It is consistent with previous knowledge, and provides finer details. Using available phylogenetic trees, evolution can be rephrased in terms of {CP} {origins.Supplementary} information is also available at {http://adios.tau.ac.il/ORPS}},

@article{citeulike:964046,
    abstract = {The main goal of the motif finding problem is to detect novel, over-represented unknown signals in a set of sequences (e.g. transcription factor binding sites in a genome). The most widely used algorithms for finding motifs obtain a generative probabilistic representation of these over-represented signals and try to discover profiles that maximize the information content score. Although these profiles form a very powerful representation of the signals, the major difficulty arises from the fact that the best motif corresponds to the global maximum of a non-convex continuous function. Popular algorithms like Expectation Maximization ({EM}) and Gibbs sampling tend to be very sensitive to the initial guesses and are known to converge to the nearest local maximum very quickly. In order to improve the quality of the results, {EM} is used with multiple random starts or any other powerful stochastic global methods that might yield promising initial guesses (like projection algorithms). Global methods 
do not necessarily give initial guesses in the convergence region of the best local maximum but rather suggest that a promising solution is in the neighborhood region. In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization framework that searches the neighborhood regions of the initial alignment in a systematic manner to explore the multiple local optimal solutions. This effective search is achieved by transforming the original optimization problem into its corresponding dynamical system and estimating the practical stability boundary of the local maximum. Our results show that the popularly used {EM} algorithm often converges to sub-optimal solutions which can be significantly improved by the proposed neighborhood profile search. Based on experiments using both synthetic and real datasets, our method demonstrates significant improvements in the information content scores of the probabilistic models. The proposed method also gives the flexibility in using different local solvers and global methods depending on 
their suitability for some specific datasets.},

Recent research efforts to improve the reliability and accuracy of image classification have led to the introduction of the Support Vector Classification ({SVC}) scheme. {SVC} is a new generation of supervised learning method based on the principle of statistical learning theory, which is designed to decrease uncertainty in the model structure and the fitness of data. We have presented a comparative analysis of {SVC} with the Maximum Likelihood Classification ({MLC}) method, which is the most popular conventional supervised classification technique. {SVC} is an optimization technique in which the classification accuracy heavily relies on identifying the optimal parameters. Using a case study, we verify a method to obtain these optimal parameters such that {SVC} can be applied efficiently. We use multispectral and hyperspectral images to develop thematic classes of 
known lithologic units in order to compare the classification accuracy of both the methods. We have varied the training to testing data proportions to assess the relative robustness and the optimal training sample requirement of both the methods to achieve comparable levels of accuracy. The results of our study illustrated that {SVC} improved the classification accuracy, was robust and did not suffer from dimensionality issues such as the Hughes Effect.},

Time series discords are subsequences of a longer time series that are maximally different to all the rest of the time series subsequences. They thus capture the sense of the most unusual subsequence within a time series. Time series discords have many uses for data mining, including improving the quality of clustering, data cleaning, summarization, and anomaly detection. Discords are particularly attractive as anomaly detectors because they only require one intuitive parameter (the length of the subsequence) unlike most anomaly detection algorithms that typically require many parameters. We evaluate our work with a comprehensive set of experiments. In particular, we demonstrate the utility of discords with objective experiments on domains as diverse as Space Shuttle telemetry monitoring, medicine, surveillance, and industry, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of our discord discovery algorithm with more than one 
million experiments, on 82 different datasets from diverse domains.},

                In a previous paper, we introduced {MUSCLE}, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing {MUSCLE} to achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, {MUSCLE}-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles.
                We compare the speed and accuracy of {MUSCLE} with {CLUSTALW}, Progressive {POA} and the {MAFFT} script {FFTNS1}, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: {BAliBASE}, {PREFAB}, {SABmark} and {SMART}. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy ({MUSCLE} with default settings), highest speed ({MUSCLE}-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two ({MUSCLE}-prog). We find {MUSCLE}-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to {CLUSTALW} in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. {MUSCLE}-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer.
                {MUSCLE} offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs. {MUSCLE} is freely available at http://www.drive5.com/muscle.

    abstract = {Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp; Drosophila melanogaster has proven to be a useful model system to probe the mechanisms underlying the detection, discrimination, and perception of volatile odorants. The relatively small receptor repertoire of 62 odorant receptors makes the goal of understanding odor responses from the total receptor repertoire approachable in this system, and recent work has been directed toward this goal. In addition, new work not only sheds light but also raises more questions about the initial steps in odor perception in this system. Odorant receptor genes in Drosophila are predicted to encode seven transmembrane receptors, but surprising data suggest that these receptors may be inverted in the plasma membrane compared to classical G-protein coupled receptors. Finally, although some Drosophila odorant receptors are activated directly by odorant molecules, detection of a volatile pheromone, 11-cis vaccenyl acetate requires an extracellular adapter protein called {LUSH} for activation 
of pheromone sensitive neurons. Because pheromones are used by insects to trigger mating and other behaviors, these insights may herald new approaches to control behavior in pathogenic and agricultural pest insects.},

We interpret this to mean that open source software development has not changed its code integration practices.

    abstract = {As a recognized discipline, software engineering traces its roots back to the 1968 {NATO} conference where the term was first used extensively to highlight the need for an engineering approach to the development of software. In the 30 years since that first  ” software engineering” conference, significant attempts have been made to improve the overall effectiveness of the software development process, and thus reduce the frequency and severity of software project failures. A major part of this improvement effort has been the attempt to develop quantitative measures which can be used to more accurately describe and better understand and manage the software development life cycle. Thus, many software metrics and models have been introduced during this period. In this article, we briefly trace the history of the development of software metrics and models, and then summarize the current state of the field. For discussion purposes, this entire development period is then arbitrarily divided into an 
Introductory Period (1971–1985), Growth Period (1985–1997) and the Current Period (1997–?). The development of metrics during each of these periods is then related to the treatment of software metrics and models in software engineering curricula during that same period. Our conclusion is that software engineering curricula have indeed reflected the state of software engineering as the work in software metrics and models has progressed. Furthermore, software engineering curricula of the future should reflect the relatively mature state that software metrics have attained, by covering the basic concepts of metrics in appropriate core courses, and more advanced metrics topics in a specialized, elective metrics course.},

    abstract = {Uncertainty in estimates of survival of dispersing animals is a vexing difficulty in conservation biology. The current notion is that this uncertainty decreases the usefulness of spatially explicit population models in particular. We examined this problem by comparing dispersal models of three levels of complexity: (1) an event-based binomial model that considers only the occurrence of mortality or arrival, (2) a temporally explicit exponential model that employs mortality and arrival rates, and (3) a spatially explicit gridwalk model that simulates the movement of animals through an artificial landscape. Each model was fitted to the same set of field data. A first objective of the paper is to illustrate how the maximum-likelihood method can be used in all three cases to estimate the means and confidence limits for the relevant model parameters, given a particular set of data on dispersal survival. Using this framework we show that the structure of the uncertainty for all three models is 
strikingly similar. In fact, the results of our unified approach imply that spatially explicit dispersal models, which take advantage of information on landscape details, suffer less from uncertainly than do simpler models. Moreover, we show that the proposed strategy of model development safeguards one from error propagation in these more complex models. Finally, our approach shows that all models related to animal dispersal, ranging from simple to complex, can be related in a hierarchical fashion, so that the various approaches to modeling such dispersal can be viewed from a unified perspective.},

    abstract = {We present a method for modeling user navigation on a web site using grammatical inference of stochastic regular grammars. With this method we achieve better models than the previously used first order Markov chains, in terms of predictive accuracy and utility of recommendations. In order to obtain comparable results, we apply the same grammatical inference algorithms on Markov chains, modeled as probabilistic automata. The automata induced in this way perform better than the original Markov chains, as models for user navigation, but they are considerably inferior to the automata induced by the traditional grammatical inference methods. The evaluation of our method was based on two web usage data sets from two very dissimilar web sites. It consisted in producing, for each user, a personalized list of recommendations and then measuring its recall and expected utility.},

We provide the first polynomial-time algorithm to test for the twins property, which determines if a {WFA} admits a deterministic equivalent. We also provide a rigorous analysis of a determinization algorithm of Mohri, with tight bounds for acyclic {WFAs}. Given that {WFAs} can expand exponentially when determinized, we explore why those used in {ASR} tend to shrink. The folklore explanation is that {ASR} {WFAs} have an acyclic, multi-partite structure. We show, however, that there exist such {WFAs} that always incur exponential expansion when determinized. We then introduce a class of {WFAs}, also with this structure, whose expansion depends on the weights: some weightings cause them to shrink, while others, including random weightings, cause them to expand {exponentially.We} provide experimental evidence that {ASR} {WFAs} exhibit this weight 
dependence. That they shrink when determinized, therefore, is a result of favorable weightings in addition to special topology.},

    abstract = {The mosquito Anopheles gambiae is the major vector of malaria in {sub-Saharan} Africa. It locates its human hosts primarily through olfaction, but little is known about the molecular basis of this process. Here we functionally characterize the Anopheles gambiae odorant receptor ({AgOr}) repertoire. We identify receptors that respond strongly to components of human odour and that may act in the process of human recognition. Some of these receptors are narrowly tuned, and some salient odorants elicit strong responses from only one or a few receptors, suggesting a central role for specific transmission channels in human host-seeking behaviour. This analysis of the Anopheles gambiae receptors permits a comparison with the corresponding Drosophila melanogaster odorant receptor repertoire. We find that odorants are differentially encoded by the two species in ways consistent with their ecological needs. Our analysis of the Anopheles gambiae repertoire identifies receptors that may be useful targets 
for controlling the transmission of malaria.},

Gene discovery of these proteins is a time-consuming task. In recent years, expressed sequence tags ({ESTs}) of many insect species have accumulated, thus providing a useful resource for gene {discovery.RESULTS}:We have developed a computational pipeline to identify {OBP} and {CSP} genes from insect {ESTs}. In total, 752,841 insect {ESTs} were examined from 54 species covering eight Orders of Insecta. From these {ESTs}, 142 {OBPs} and 177 {CSPs} were identified, of which 117 {OBPs} and 129 {CSPs} are new. The complete open reading frames ({ORFs}) of 88 {OBPs} and 123 {CSPs} were obtained by electronic elongation. We randomly chose 26 {OBPs} from eight species of insects, and 21 {CSPs} from four species for {RT}-{PCR} validation. Twenty two {OBPs} and 16 {CSPs} were confirmed by {RT}-{PCR}, proving the efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. 
Together with all family members obtained from the {NCBI} ({OBPs}) or the {UniProtKB} ({CSPs}), 850 {OBPs} and 237 {CSPs} were analyzed for their structural characteristics and evolutionary {relationship.CONCLUSIONS}:A large number of new {OBPs} and {CSPs} were found, providing the basis for deeper understanding of these proteins. In addition, the conserved motif and evolutionary analysis provide some new insights into the evolution of insect {OBPs} and {CSPs}. Motif pattern fine-tune the functions of {OBPs} and {CSPs}, leading to the minor difference in binding sex pheromone or plant volatiles in different insect Orders.},

Development of the zooplankton followed the phytoplankton bloom phase, which was progressing in a direction from west to east in the waters north of Svalbard, and southwards in the Barents Sea.

    abstract = {doi: {10.1515/BOT}.2009.073 Abstract Polar algae have a striking ability to photosynthesize and grow under very low light and temperatures. In seaweeds, minimum light demands for photosynthetic saturation and compensation can be as low as 10 and 2 μmol photons m-2 s-1, respectively. For benthic microalgae, these values can be even lower because of the limited irradiance reaching deep sea floors. The extreme shade adaptation of these organisms sets their distributional limits at depths close to 40 m and enables them to tolerate long periods of extended darkness. In addition to their capability for efficient photosynthesis at extremely low light levels, polar algae possess metabolic adaptations to persist at low temperatures, which permit them to complete their life cycles at year-round temperatures close to {0°C}. Seaweeds with the lowest temperature demands are the species endemic to the Antarctic while Arctic algae are comparatively less cold-adapted. These adaptive characteristics allow 
benthic marine algae to make high contributions to high latitude coastal primary productivity and energy fluxes, exceeding or equaling the production of primary producers in more temperate systems. The studies summarized here give important insights into the major physiological adaptations allowing marine benthic microalgae and seaweeds to colonize these extreme habitats.},

    abstract = {Pronounced seasonality is a characteristic feature of polar ecosystems, but seasonal studies in the {high-Arctic} pack-ice zone are still scarce because of logistical constraints. During six expeditions (1994–2003) to the Fram Strait area between Greenland and Svalbard in winter, spring, early summer, late summer and autumn, the sub-ice habitat and fauna below the pack ice (0–1 m depth) were analyzed for seasonal patterns. Both environmental variables such as ice cover, temperature, salinity and chlorophyll  a  (chl  a ), as well as species composition, abundance and biomass of the sub-ice fauna showed distinct seasonal dynamics. Most species of the sub-ice fauna were found in early summer, followed by autumn, spring and late summer; the lowest number occurred in winter. The sub-ice fauna was dominated by copepod nauplii during all seasons. Next numerous was the small pelagic copepod  Oithona similis,  followed by occassional swarms of  Pseudocalanus minutus  and  Calanus  spp. Abundances of 
the sympagic fauna in the sub-ice water layer were much lower, with ectinosomatid copepods being usually the most numerous sympagic group. In the course of the year, total abundances of the sub-ice fauna showed a steep increase from the earliest sampling dates towards the end of winter/beginning of spring reaching maximum numbers then, and a decrease to minimum numbers in early summer. A second peak occurred in late summer, followed by a decrease towards autumn. This significant trend was due to the abundances of copepod nauplii and  Oithona similis . Sympagic species were virtually absent during winter, and increased significantly in spring and early and late summer. A factor analysis revealed the variables ice cover and thickness, water temperature and salinity, as well as chl  a  as the major controlling factors for the seasonal patterns in different groups and species of the sub-ice fauna. Because of the special environmental conditions in the sub-ice habitat, and the unique species composition 
characterized by small taxa, young stages, and sympagic species, the seasonal dynamics of the Arctic sub-ice fauna differ substantially from those of the epipelagic zooplankton community in the Arctic Ocean.},

    abstract = {Alterations in sea ice and primary production are expected to have cascading influences on the food web in high Arctic marine ecosystems. This study spanned four years and examined the spring phytoplankton production bloom in Disko Bay, West Greenland ({69°N}, {53°W}) (using chlorophyll  a  concentrations as a proxy) under contrasting sea ice conditions in 2001 and 2003 (heavy sea ice) and 2002 and 2004 (light sea ice). Satellite-based observations of chlorophyll  a , sea ice and sea surface temperature were used together with in situ depth profiles of chlorophyll  a  fluorescence collected at 24 sampling stations along the south coast of Disko Island (5–30 km offshore) in May 2003 and 2004. Chlorophyll  a  and sea surface temperatures were also obtained from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer ({MODIS}: {EOS}-Terra and {AQUA} satellites) between March 2001 and July 2004. Daily {SMMR}/{SSMI} sea ice data were obtained in the same years. An empirical regional algorithm was 
developed to calibrate ratios of remotely sensed measurements of water leaving radiance with in situ chlorophyll  a  fluorescence. The optimal integration depth was 0–4 m, explaining between 70\% and 91\% of the variance. The spatial development of the phytoplankton bloom showed that the southwestern corner of the study area had the earliest and the largest spring phytoplankton bloom. The eastern part of Disko Bay, influenced by meltwater outflow from the glaciers, shows no signs of an early phytoplankton bloom and followed the general pattern of an accelerated bloom soon after the disappearance of sea ice. In all four years the coupling between phytoplankton and sea ice was bounded by average open water between 50\% and 80\%, likely due to the combined availability of light and stable open water. The daily incremental growth in both mean chlorophyll  a  density (chlorophyll  a  per volume water, μg l −1 ) and abundance (density of chlorophyll  a  extrapolated to ice free areas, tons) estimated by linear 
regression (chlorophyll  a  vs. day) between 1 April and 15 May was highest in 2002 and 2004 (light ice years) and lowest in 2001 and 2003 (heavy ice years). In years with late sea ice retreat the chlorophyll  a  attained only slightly lower densities than in years with early sea ice retreat. However, the abundance of chlorophyll  a  in light ice years was considerably larger than in heavy ice years, and there was an obvious effect of more open water for light-induced stimulation of primary production. This observation demonstrates the importance of estimating chlorophyll  a  abundance rather than density in sea ice covered areas. This study also presents the first regional calibration of {MODIS} chlorophyll  a  data for Arctic waters.},

    abstract = {A rise in global temperatures could potentially lead to less ice in the Arctic, including a reduction in the ice-covered period. The consequence of a changing ice cover on the food web structure and production in Disko Bay, Western Greenland, is analysed through application of a dynamical model for the planktonic food web. The model is successfully calibrated and tested for sensitivity, using a detailed data set for 1996–1997. Model scenarios are (1) extended ice cover and (2) no ice. These scenarios are compared to model runs with measured ice cover in two normal years. In the extended ice scenario, assuming unchanged copepod behaviour, copepods are starving or feeding in the ice/water interface from the time they ascend to the surface layer from over-wintering depths until the ice break-up in June. The total annual primary production reaches the same level as it does in the average year, but copepod ingestion and, as a consequence, vertical carbon export is reduced by app. 40\%. In the ice-
free situation, an early diatom bloom is initiated by stratification of the water in March, before the copepods ascend. The diatom bloom is grazed upon by protozooplankton, which reach a high biomass before the copepods ascend in April. Annual primary production increases by 52\% while copepod ingestion and vertical loss of carbon is reduced by 57\%. This study illustrates how a change in the ice cover in Arctic areas can potentially create a mismatch between spring primary production and copepod grazers. The result may be a planktonic food web dominated by protozooplankton, resulting in lower export of organic material out of the photic zone despite increased primary productivity, or alternatively lead to changes in species composition or behaviour.},

    abstract = {In shelf waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula ({wAP}), with abundant macro- and micronutrients, water-column stability has been suggested as the main factor controlling primary production; freshwater input from sea-ice melting stabilizes the upper water column by forming a shallow summer mixed layer. Retreating sea ice in the spring and summer thus defines the area of influence, the sea-ice zone ({SIZ}) and the marginal ice zone ({MIZ}). A 12-year time series (1995–2006) was analyzed to address two main questions: (1) what are the spatial and temporal patterns in primary production; and (2) to what extent and in what ways is primary production related to sea-ice dynamics. Data were collected on cruises performed during January of each year, at the height of the growth season, within the region bounded by {64°S} and {64°W} to the north and {68°S} and {66°W} to the south. Average daily integrated primary production varied by an order of magnitude, from  250 to  1100 mg C m −2  d −1 , with 
an average cruise primary production of 745 mg C m −2  d −1 . A strong onshore–offshore gradient was evident along the shelf with higher production observed inshore. Inter-annual regional production varied by a factor of 7: maximum rates were measured in 2006 (1788 mg C m −2  d −1 ) and minimum in 1999 (248 mg C m −2  d −1 ). The results support the hypothesis that primary production in the {wAP} shelf is related to sea-ice dynamics. To first order, shallower summer mixed-layer depths in the shelf correlated with late sea retreat and primary production. Principal component analysis showed that high primary production in January was associated with enhanced shelf production toward the coast and in the south, explaining 63\% of the variability in space and time. This first mode captured the inter-annual variability in regional production. Temporal variability in primary production (time series of anomalies defined for each location) showed spatial dependence: higher primary production correlated with shallow 
mixed-layer depths only at mid-shelf; in coastal and offshore waters, primary production correlated with deeper mixed layers. Thus, coastal primary production can show a non-linear relationship with summer mixed layers. Under conditions of large biomass (>20 mg chl  a  m −3 ) and shallow mixed-layer depth (e.g., 5 m) phytoplankton production becomes light limited. This limitation is reduced with a deepening of the summer mixed layer (e.g., 20 m). Dominance of diatoms and the ability to adapt and photosynthesize at higher light levels characterized the large phytoplankton blooms. No significant regional trend in primary production was detected within the 12-year series. We conclude that the regional average primary production on the {wAP} shelf is associated with shallow summer mixed layers in conjunction with late sea-ice retreat. An opposite relationship is observed for the highest production rates in coastal waters, associated with large biomass, where a deepening of the summer mixed layer relieves light 
limitation.},

                Whole-genome hybridization studies have suggested that the nuclear genomes of accessions (natural strains) of Arabidopsis thaliana can differ by several percent of their sequence. To examine this variation, and as a first step in the 1001 Genomes Project for this species, we produced 15- to 25-fold coverage in Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis ({SBS}) reads for the reference accession, Col-0, and two divergent strains, Bur-0 and Tsu-1. We aligned reads to the reference genome sequence to assess data quality metrics and to detect polymorphisms. Alignments revealed 823,325 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and 79,961 unique 1- to 3-bp indels in the divergent accessions at a specificity of >99\%, and over 2000 potential errors in the reference genome sequence. We also identified >3.4 Mb of the Bur-0 and Tsu-1 genomes as being either extremely dissimilar, deleted, or duplicated relative to the reference genome. To obtain sequences for these regions, we incorporated the Velvet 
assembler into a targeted de novo assembly method. This approach yielded 10,921 high-confidence contigs that were anchored to flanking sequences and harbored indels as large as 641 bp. Our methods are broadly applicable for polymorphism discovery in moderate to large genomes even at highly diverged loci, and we established by subsampling the Illumina {SBS} coverage depth required to inform a broad range of functional and evolutionary studies. Our pipeline for aligning reads and predicting {SNPs} and indels, {SHORE}, is available for download at http://1001genomes.org.

Because these instruments are new, their data require characterization with respect to accuracy and utility. To address this, we sequenced a Caernohabditis elegans N2 Bristol strain isolate using the Solexa Sequence Analyzer, and compared the reads to the reference genome to characterize the data and to evaluate coverage and representation. Massively parallel sequencing facilitates strain-to-reference comparison for genome-wide sequence variant discovery. Owing to the short-read-length sequences produced, we developed a revised approach to determine the regions of the genome to which short reads could be uniquely mapped. We then aligned Solexa reads from C. elegans strain {CB4858} to the reference, and screened for single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and small indels. This study demonstrates the utility of massively parallel short read sequencing for whole genome resequencing and for 
accurate discovery of genome-wide polymorphisms.},

In Apriori-based graph mining, to determine candidate subgraphs from a huge number of generated adjacency matrices is usually the dominating factor for the overall graph mining performance since it requires to perform many graph isomorphism tests. To address this issue, we develop an effective algorithm for the candidate set generation. It is a hash-based algorithm and was confirmed effective through experiments on both real-world and synthetic graph data.},

One unanswered question is whether such affective forecasting errors are due to participants' poor estimation of their initial emotional reactions (an  initial intensity bias ), poor estimation of the rate at which these emotional reactions diminish over time (a  decay bias ), or both. The present research used intensive longitudinal procedures to explore this question in the wake of an upsetting life event: the dissolution of a romantic relationship. Results revealed that the affective forecasting error is entirely accounted for by an initial intensity bias, with no contribution by a decay bias. In addition, several moderators of the affective forecasting error emerged: participants who were more in love with their partners, who thought it was unlikely they would soon enter a new relationship, and who played less of a role in initiating the breakup made especially inaccurate forecasts.},

Our previous research has exposed us to a variety of real-world biological datasets that contain attributes whose values are sets of elements, instead of just individual elements. However, very few data mining tools accept datasets that contain these set-valued attributes, and none of them allow the mining of association rules directly from this type of data. We introduce in this paper two algorithms for mining (classification) association rules directly from set-valued data and compare their performance. We have implemented a system based on one of these algorithms and have applied it to a number of biological datasets. We describe here our system and highlight its merits by means of comparing the results achieved with it and the failed attempts to mine association rules from those datasets using standard tools. Our system makes the creation of input files containing set-valued data much 
easier, and makes the mining of association rules directly from these data possible.},

    abstract = {"It premieres the most adept researchers in the field who have bravely and
soundly followed mixed methodology approaches."

-{NACADA} (National {ACademic} {ADvising} Association)


In recent years, researchers have begun to combine quantitative and
qualitative approaches within single study research designs. As such, the
literature on mixed methods research has grown at a rapid pace. While more
methodological books addressing mixed methods are becoming available, the
foundational writings of this field are still scattered across diverse
disciplines and their wide range of publications outlets, leaving students and
researchers at a disadvantage to find the exemplary or model studies to help
them understand how to conduct their own mixed methods research.


In light of the dispersed nature of the mixed methods literature, **The Mixed
Methods Reader **editors have organized a collection of key methodological
mixed methods discussions and exemplar mixed methods research studies in one
easy-to-access location. This integrative collection draws from the
international literature appearing across diverse research disciplines over
the past thirty years. **The Mixed Methods Reader **is divided into two parts:
Part I – Methodological Selections and Part {II} – Exemplar Research Studies.
Part I includes a collection of 14 foundational writings from the mixed
methods research literature. These readings convey the overall development and
evolution of mixed methods research and address essential topics for
researchers new to the field of mixed methods research. These topics include
its foundations; design types; implementation issues such as sampling, data
analysis, and validity; rhetorical devices for reporting mixed methods
studies; and critiques about the current thinking in the field. Part {II}
includes 9 exemplar mixed methods research studies drawn from a range of
disciplines and international scholars. The studies were intentionally
selected to illustrate four major types of mixed methods designs. As with the
methodological chapters, the editors organize the exemplar research studies so
that the reader can see a natural progression of the different approaches to
conducting mixed methods research.


**The Mixed Methods Reader**, edited by two leading researchers in mixed
methods research, offers students and researchers a rich balance of
foundational works and exemplary studies across a range of disciplines. This
reader is an invaluable primary or supplementary resource for courses that
address mixed methods research.


**Key Features**

  * Each of the 14 foundational readings offers a brief introduction by the
editors, discussing the reading's overall importance to mixed methods research
and explaining what aspect of the research process is addressed.

  * The foundational readings are organized around the research process to
facilitate its use as a text or supplement for research courses emphasizing
mixed methods approaches. They cover research design types and purposes, data
collection, data analysis, reporting of mixed methods studies, and future
directions.

  * Each of the 9 exemplary studies include a brief commentary from the
editors, highlighting the noteworthy features of the article. These exemplary
studies range in discipline and setting yet focus intently on the research
process and the various ways of conducting mixed methods studies.

  * Visual diagrams accompany each exemplary study: These visual diagrams will
convey the overall structure and approach used in each of the studies.

  * Discussion questions accompanying each selection further call attention to
the key points and help a student or individual researcher to tie together the
core concepts presented in the commentaries and articles.},

the territory that lies ahead for researchers across the disciplines.

The Second Edition is a significant revision; in fact, it is virtually a new

ethnography, critical race theory, applied ethnography, queer theory, and
testimonies. Another fifteen chapters are written by new contributors. And
every chapter in the book has been thoroughly revised and updated.

At the beginning of the twenty-first century, it is necessary to re-engage the
promise of qualitative research as a generative form of inquiry. The Second
Edition of the Handbook reveals how the discourses of qualitative research can
be used to imagine and create a free and democratic society. Ground-breaking,

    abstract = {In recent years evaluators of educational and social programs have expanded their methodological repertoire with designs that include the use of both qualitative and quantitative methods. Such practice, however, needs to be grounded in a theory that can meaningfully guide the design and implementation of mixed-method evaluations. In this study, a mixed-method conceptual framework was developed from the theoretical literature and then refined through an analysis of 57 empirical mixed-method evaluations. Five purposes for mixed-method evaluations are identified in this conceptual framework: triangulation, complementarity, development, initiation, and expansion. For each of the five purposes, a recommended design is also presented in terms of seven relevant design characteristics. These design elements encompass issues about methods, the phenomena under investigation, paradigmatic framework, and criteria for implementation. In the empirical review, common misuse of the term triangulation was 
apparent in evaluations that stated such a purpose but did not employ an appropriate design. In addition, relatively few evaluations in this review integrated the different method types at the level of data analysis. Strategies for integrated data analysis are among the issues identified as priorities for further mixed-method work.},

stimulates students through walk through experiences, use of exercises, and
production of actual writing samples. It is a book that models the types of
issues that best suit different approaches and allows students to understand
when to use mixed methods. Furthermore, its focus on theory and paradigms is
done in a way that helps students decode their meaning."

@phdthesis{csdl2-06-05,
    abstract = {Software development is slow, expensive and error prone, often resulting in products with a large number of defects which cause serious problems in usability, reliability, and performance. To combat this problem, software measurement provides a systematic and empirically-guided approach to control and improve software development processes and final products. However, due to the high cost associated with ``metrics collection'' and difficulties in ``metrics decision-making,'' measurement is not widely adopted by software organizations. This dissertation proposes a novel metrics-based program called ``software project telemetry'' to address the problems. It uses software sensors to collect metrics automatically and unobtrusively. It employs a domain-specific language to represent telemetry trends in software product and process metrics. Project management and process improvement decisions are made by detecting changes in telemetry trends and comparing trends between different periods of the 
same project. Software project telemetry avoids many problems inherent in traditional metrics models, such as the need to accumulate a historical project database and ensure that the historical data remain comparable to current and future projects. The claim of this dissertation is that software project telemetry provides an effective approach to (1) automated metrics collection and analysis, and (2) in-process, empirically-guided software development process problem detection and diagnosis. Two empirical studies were carried out to evaluate the claim: one in software engineering classes, and the other in the Collaborative Software Development Lab. The results suggested that software project telemetry had acceptably-low metrics collection and analysis overhead, and that it provided decision-making value at least in the exploratory context of the two studies.},

In this paper, a set of heuristics for grouping change-sets (i.e., log-entries) found in source-code repositories is presented.

Some dependencies between source code, such as those between source code written in different languages, are difficult to determine using existing static and dynamic analyses. To augment existing analyses and to help developers identify relevant source code during a modification task, we have developed an approach that applies data mining techniques to determine change patterns - sets of files that were changed together frequently in the past - from the change history of the code base. Our hypothesis is that the change patterns can be used to recommend potentially relevant source code to a developer performing a modification task.

In this paper, we propose an approach for mining change patterns in {AspectJ} software evolution. Our approach first decomposes the software changes into a set of atomic change representations, then employs the apriori data mining algorithm to generate the most frequent itemsets. The patterns we found reveal multiple properties of software changes, including their kind, frequency, and correlation with other changes. In our empirical evaluation on several non-trivial {AspectJ} benchmarks, we demonstrate that those change patterns can be used as measurement aid and fault

@phdthesis{citeulike:2703162,
    abstract = {A recent focus of interest in software engineering research is on low-level software processes, which define how software developers or development teams should carry on development activities in short phases that last from several minutes to a few hours. Anecdotal evidence exists for the positive impact on quality and productivity of certain low-level software processes such as test-driven development and continuous integration. However, empirical research on low-level software processes often yields conflicting results. A significant threat to the validity of the empirical studies on low-level software processes is that they lack the ability to rigorously assess process conformance. That is to say, the degree to which developers follow the low-level software processes can not be evaluated. In order to improve the quality of empirical research on low-level software processes, I developed a technique called Software Development Stream Analysis ({SDSA}) that can infer development behaviors 
using automatically collected in-process software metrics. The collection of development activities is supported by Hackystat, a framework for automated software process and product metrics collection and analysis. {SDSA} abstracts the collected software metrics into a software development stream, a time-series data structure containing time-stamped development events. It then partitions the development stream into episodes, and then uses a rule-based system to infer low-level development behaviors exhibited in episodes. With the capabilities provided by Hackystat and {SDSA}, I developed the Zorro software system to study a specific low-level software process called {Test-Driven} Development ({TDD}). Experience reports have shown that {TDD} can greatly improve software quality with increased developer productivity, but empirical research findings on {TDD} are often mixed. An inability to rigorously assess process conformance is a possible explanation. Zorro can rigorously assess process conformance to a 
specific operational definition for {TDD}, and thus enable more controlled, comparable empirical studies. My research has demonstrated that Zorro can recognize the low-level software development behaviors that characterize {TDD}. Both the pilot and classroom case studies support this conclusion. The industrial case study shows that the automated data collection and development behavior inference has the potential to be useful for researchers.},

In this paper, we attempt to apply the concept of pre-large sequences to maintain sequential  patterns as records are deleted. Pre-large sequences are defined by a lower support threshold and an upper support threshold. They act as buffers to avoid the movements of sequential patterns directly from large to small and vice-versa. Our proposed algorithm does not  require rescanning original databases until the accumulative amount of deleted customer sequences exceeds a safety bound, which depends on database size. As databases grow larger, the numbers of deleted customer sequences allowed before database rescanning  is required also grow. The proposed approach is thus efficient for a large database.},

Self-organizing neural networks are used to discover elementary patterns in the time series. Machine learning ({ML}) algorithms use the results of the neural networks to automatically generate a rule-based description. At the next levels, temporal grammatical rules are inferred.

A temporal pattern  is dened as a set of states together with their interval relationships  described in terms of Allen\&\#039;s interval logic, for instance \A before B,  A overlaps C, C overlaps B\&\#034; or equivalently \state A ends before state  B starts, the gap is covered by state C\&\#034;. As an example we consider  the problem of deriving local weather forecasting rules that allow us to  conclude from the qualitative behaviour of the air-pressure curve to the  wind-strength. Here, the states have been extracted automatically from  (multivariate) time series and characterize the trend of the time series  locally within the assigned time interval.  1 },

    abstract = {This paper presents a novel method to derive a Petri net from any specification model that can be mapped into a state-based representation with arcs labeled with symbols from an alphabet of events (a Transition System, {TS}). The method is based on the theory of regions for Elementary Transition Systems ({ETS}). Previous work has shown that, for any {ETS}, there exists a Petri Net with minimum transition count (one transition for each label) with a reachability graph isomorphic to the original Transition System. Our method extends and implements that theory by using the following three mechanisms that provide a framework for synthesis of safe Petri nets from arbitrary {TSs}. First, the requirement of isomorphism is relaxed to bisimulation of {TSs}, thus extending the class of synthesizable {TSs} to a new class called {Excitation-Closed} Transition Systems ({ECTS}). Second, for the first time, we propose a method of {PN} synthesis for an arbitrary {TS} based on mapping a {TS} event into a set 
of transition labels in a {PN}. Third, the notion of irredundant region set is exploited, to minimize the number of places in the net without affecting its behavior. The synthesis method can derive different classes of place-irredundant Petri Nets (e.g., pure, free choice, unique choice) from the same {TS}, depending on the constraints imposed on the synthesis algorithm. This method has been implemented and applied in different frameworks. The results obtained from the experiments have demonstrated the wide applicability of the method},

    abstract = {The topic of process mining has attracted the attention of both researchers and tool vendors in the Business Process Management ({BPM}) space. The goal of process mining is to discover process models from event logs, i.e., events logged by some information system are used to extract information about activities and their causal relations. Several algorithms have been proposed for process mining. Many of these algorithms cannot deal with concurrency. Other typical problems are the presence of duplicate activities, hidden activities, non-free-choice constructs, etc. In addition, real-life logs contain noise (e.g., exceptions or incorrectly logged events) and are typically incomplete (i.e., the event logs contain only a fragment of all possible behaviors). To tackle these problems we propose a completely new approach based on genetic algorithms. As can be expected, a genetic approach is able to deal with noise and incompleteness. However, it is not easy to represent processes properly in a 
genetic setting. In this paper, we show a genetic process mining approach using the so-called causal matrix as a representation for individuals. We elaborate on the relation between Petri nets and this representation and show that genetic algorithms can be used to discover Petri net models from event logs.

Creating a workflow design is a complicated time-consuming process and typically, there are discrepancies between the actual workflow processes and the processes as perceived by the management. Therefore, we propose a technique for rediscovering workflow models. This technique uses workflow logs to discover the workflow process as it is actually being executed. The workflow log contains information about events taking place. We assume that these events are totally ordered and each event refers to one task being executed for a single case. This information can easily be extracted from transactional information systems (e.g., Enterprise Resource Planning systems such as {SAP} and Baan). The rediscovering technique proposed in this paper can deal with noise and can also be used to validate workflow processes by 
uncovering and measuring the discrepancies between prescriptive models and actual process executions.},

    abstract = {Abstract  Process mining includes the automated discovery of processes from event logs. Based on observed events (e.g., activities being executed or messages being exchanged) a process model is constructed. One of the essential problems in process mining is that one cannot assume to have seen all possible behavior. At best, one has seen a representative subset. Therefore, classical synthesis techniques are not suitable as they aim at finding a model that is able to exactly reproduce the log. Existing process mining techniques try to avoid such  ” overfitting” by generalizing the model to allow for more behavior. This generalization is often driven by the representation language and very crude assumptions about completeness. As a result, parts of the model are  ” overfitting” (allow only for what has actually been observed) while other parts may be  ” underfitting” (allow for much more behavior without strong support for it). None of the existing techniques enables the user to control the 
balance between  ” overfitting” and  ” underfitting”. To address this, we propose a two-step approach. First, using a configurable approach, a transition system is constructed. Then, using the  ” theory of regions”, the model is synthesized. The approach has been implemented in the context of {ProM} and overcomes many of the limitations of traditional approaches.},

    abstract = {Software is a ubiquitous component of our daily life. We often depend on the correct working of software systems. Due to the difficulty and complexity of software systems, bugs and anomalies are prevalent. Bugs have caused billions of dollars loss, in addition to privacy and security threats. In this work, we address software reliability issues by proposing a novel method to classify software behaviors based on past history or runs. With the technique, it is possible to generalize past known errors and mistakes to capture failures and anomalies. Our technique first mines a set of discriminative features capturing repetitive series of events from program execution traces. It then performs feature selection to select the best features for classification. These features are then used to train a classifier to detect failures. Experiments and case studies on traces of several benchmark software systems and a real-life concurrency bug from {MySQL} server show the utility of the technique in 
capturing failures and anomalies. On average, our pattern-based classification technique outperforms the baseline approach by 24.68\% in accuracy.},

    abstract = {Many software process methods and tools presuppose the existence of a formal model of a process. Unfortunately, developing a formal model for an on-going, complex process can be difficult, costly, and error prone. This presents a practical barrier to the adoption of process technologies, which would be lowered by automated assistance in creating formal models. To this end, we have developed a data analysis technique that we term process discovery. Under this technique, data describing process events are first captured from an on-going process and then used to generate a formal model of the behavior of that process. In this article we describe a Markov method that we developed specifically for process discovery, as well as describe two additional methods that we   adopted from other domains and augmented for our purposes. The three methods range from the purely algorithmic to the purely statistical. We compare the methods and discuss their application in an industrial case study.},

We present an approach for a system that constructs process models from logs of past, unstructured executions of the given process. The graph so produced conforms to the dependencies and past executions present in the log. By providing models that capture the previous executions of the process, this technique allows easier introduction of a workflow system and evaluation and evolution of existing process models. We also present results from applying the algorithm to synthetic data sets as well as process logs obtained from an {IBM} Flowmark installation.},

    abstract = {Under the umbrella of buzzwords such as  Business Activity Monitoring  ({BAM}) and  Business Process Intelligence  ({BPI}) both academic (e.g., {EMiT}, Little Thumb, {InWoLvE}, Process Miner, and {MinSoN}) and commercial tools (e.g., {ARIS} {PPM}, {HP} {BPI}, and {ILOG} {JViews}) have been developed. The goal of these tools is to extract knowledge from event logs (e.g., transaction logs in an {ERP} system or audit trails in a {WFM} system), i.e., to do process mining. Unfortunately, tools use different formats for reading/storing log files and present their results in different ways. This makes it difficult to use different tools on the same data set and to compare the mining results. Furthermore, some of these tools implement concepts that can be very useful in the other tools but it is often difficult to combine tools. As a result, researchers working on new process mining techniques are forced to build a mining infrastructure from scratch or test their techniques in an isolated way, 
disconnected from any practical applications. To overcome these kind of problems, we have developed the {ProM} framework, i.e., an  pluggable  environment for process mining. The framework is flexible with respect to the input and output format, and is also open enough to allow for the easy reuse of code during the implementation of new process mining ideas. This paper introduces the {ProM} framework and gives an overview of the plug-ins that have been developed.},

Moreover, some biological sequences (e.g., microarray data) can be clustered based on the partial orders shared by the sequences. Given a set of items, a total order of a subset of items can be represented as a string. A string database is a multiset of strings. In this paper, we identify a novel problem of mining frequent closed partial orders from strings. Frequent closed partial orders capture the nonredundant and interesting ordering information from string databases. Importantly, mining frequent closed partial orders can discover meaningful knowledge that cannot be disclosed by previous data mining 
techniques. However, the problem of mining frequent closed partial orders is challenging. To tackle the problem, we develop Frecpo (for Frequent closed partial order), a practically efficient algorithm for mining the complete set of frequent closed partial orders from large string databases. Several interesting pruning techniques are devised to speed up the search. We report an extensive performance study on both real data sets and synthetic data sets to illustrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of our approach.},

Existing methods typically make strong simplifying assumptions about the form of the rules, and limit the measure of rule quality to simple properties, such as confidence. Because confidence in itself is not a good indicator of how interesting a rule is to the user, the mined rules are typically sorted according to some secondary interestingness measure. In this paper we present a rule mining method that is based on genetic programming. Because we use specialized pattern matching hardware to evaluate each rule, our method supports a very wide range of rule formats, and can use any reasonable fitness measure. We develop a fitness measure that is well-suited for our method, and give empirical results of applying the method to synthetic and real-world data sets.},

Both the original implementation and the inevitable subsequent evolution (maintenance) are a continual learning experience driven, inter alia, by feedback from the results of the behaviour under execution of the software, as perceived by various stakeholders, by advances and growth in the user organisations and by adaptation to changes in the external world, both independent and as a result of installation and use of the software. Real world, termed {type-E}, software is essentially evolutionary in nature. The study of the processes of evolution of such software is of considerable interest, as is that of the domains that co-evolve with the software. After briefly discussing the meaning of the term evolution in the context of software, its technology, the software process and related domains, this paper describes some of the facets 
of the evolution phenomenon and implications to the evolution process as identified during many years of active interest in the topic.},

    abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;We} present a new method for the understandable description of local temporal relationships in multivariate data, called Time Series Knowledge Mining ({TSKM}). We define the Time Series Knowledge Representation ({TSKR}) as a new language for expressing temporal knowledge in time interval data. The patterns have a hierarchical structure, with levels corresponding to the temporal concepts duration, coincidence, and partial order. The patterns are very compact, but offer details for each element on demand. In comparison with related approaches, the {TSKR} is shown to have advantages in robustness, expressivity, and comprehensibility. The search for coincidence and partial order in interval data can be formulated as instances of the well known frequent itemset problem. Efficient algorithms for the discovery of the patterns are adapted accordingly. A novel form of search space pruning effectively reduces the size of the mining result to ease interpretation and speed up the 
algorithms. Human interaction is used during the mining to analyze and validate partial results as early as possible and guide further processing steps. The efficacy of the methods is demonstrated using two real life data sets. In an application to sports medicine the results were recognized as valid and useful by an expert of the field.},

    abstract = {The class hierarchy is an important aspect of object-oriented software development. Design and maintenance of such a hierarchy is a difficult task that is often accomplished without any clear guidance or tool support. Formal concept analysis provides a natural theoretical framework for this problem because it can guarantee maximal factorization while preserving specialization relationships. The framework can be useful for several software development scenarios within the class hierarchy life-cycle such as design from scratch using a set of class specifications, or a set of object examples, refactoring/reengineering from existing object code or from the observation of the actual use of the classes in applications and hierarchy evolution by incrementally adding new classes. The framework can take into account different levels of specification details and suggests a number of well-defined alternative designs. These alternatives can be viewed as normal forms for class hierarchies where each 
normal form addresses particular design goals. An overview of work in the area is presented by highlighting the formal concept analysis notions that are involved. One particularly difficult problem arises when taking associations between classes into account. Basic scaling has to be extended because the scales used for building the concept lattice are dependent on it. An approach is needed to treat this circularity in a well-defined manner. Possible solutions are discussed.},

To demonstrate the viability of our approach, it was evaluated on the domains of soccer and news broadcasts. For automatic classification of semantic events, we compare three different machine learning techniques, i.c. C4.5 decision tree, maximum entropy, and support vector machine. The results show that semantic video indexing results significantly benefit from using the {TIME} framework.},

    abstract = {Periodicy detection in time series data is a challenging problem of great importance in many applications. Most previous work focused on mining synchronous periodic patterns and did not recognize the misaligned presence of a pattern due to the intervention of random noise. In this paper, we propose a more flexible model of asynchronous periodic pattern that may be present only within a subsequence and whose occurrences may be shifted due to disturbance. Two parameters min\&\#095;rep and max\&\#095;dis are employed to specify the minimum number of repetitions that is required within each segment of nondisrupted pattern occurrences and the maximum allowed disturbance between any two successive valid segments. Upon satisfying these two requirements, the longest valid subsequence of a pattern is returned. A two-phase algorithm is devised to first generate potential periods by distance-based pruning followed by an iterative procedure to derive and validate candidate patterns and locate the longest 
valid subsequence. We also show that this algorithm cannot only provide linear time complexity with respect to the length of the sequence but also achieve space efficiency.},

of design, this new edition of Herbert Simon's classic work on artificial
intelligence adds a chapter that sorts out the current themes and tools --
chaos, adaptive systems, genetic algorithms -- for analyzing complexity and
complex systems. There are updates throughout the book as well. These take
into account important advances in cognitive psychology and the science of
design while confirming and extending the book's basic thesis: that a physical
symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for intelligent action.
The chapter "Economic Reality" has also been revised to reflect a change in
emphasis in Simon's thinking about the respective roles of organizations and

    abstract = {Process mining aims at extracting information from event logs to capture the business process as it is being executed. Process mining is particularly useful in situations where events are recorded but there is no system enforcing people to work in a particular way. Consider for example a hospital where the diagnosis and treatment activities are recorded in the hospital information system, but where health-care professionals determine the "careflow." Many process mining approaches have been proposed in recent years. However, in spite of many researchers' persistent efforts, there are still several challenging problems to be solved. In this paper, we focus on mining non-free-choice constructs, i.e., situations where there is a mixture of choice and synchronization. Although most real-life processes exhibit non-free-choice behavior, existing algorithms are unable to adequately deal with such constructs. Using a Petri-net-based representation, we will show that there are two kinds of causal 
dependencies between tasks, i.e., explicit and implicit ones. We propose an algorithm that is able to deal with both kinds of dependencies. The algorithm has been implemented in the {ProM} framework and experimental results shows that the algorithm indeed significantly improves existing process mining techniques.},

    abstract = {The last decade has witnessed a tremendous growths of interests in applications that deal with querying and mining of time series data. Numerous representation methods for dimensionality reduction and similarity measures geared towards time series have been introduced. Each individual work introducing a particular method has made specific claims and, aside from the occasional theoretical justifications, provided quantitative experimental observations. However, for the most part, the comparative aspects of these experiments were too narrowly focused on demonstrating the benefits of the proposed methods over some of the previously introduced ones. In order to provide a comprehensive validation, we conducted an extensive set of time series experiments re-implementing 8 different representation methods and 9 similarity measures and their variants, and testing their effectiveness on 38 time series data sets from a wide variety of application domains. In this paper, we give an overview of these 
different techniques and present our comparative experimental findings regarding their effectiveness. Our experiments have provided both a unified validation of some of the existing achievements, and in some cases, suggested that certain claims in the literature may be unduly optimistic.},

Clustering isperhaps the most frequently used data mining algorithm, beinguseful in it's own right as an exploratory technique, and also as asubroutine in more complex data mining algorithms such as rulediscovery, indexing, summarization, anomaly detection, andclassification. Given these two facts, it is hardly surprising thattime series clustering has attracted much attention. The data to beclustered can be in one of two formats: many individual timeseries, or a single time series, from which individual time seriesare extracted with a sliding window. Given the recent explosion ofinterest in streaming data and online algorithms, the latter casehas received much {attention.In} this work we make an amazing claim. Clustering of streamingtime series is completely meaningless. More concretely, clustersextracted from streaming time series are forced to obey a certainconstraint that is 
pathologically unlikely to be satisfied by anydataset, and because of this, the clusters extracted by anyclustering algorithm are essentially random. While this constraintcan be intuitively demonstrated with a simple illustration and issimple to prove, it has never appeared in the {literature.We} can justify calling our claim surprising, since it invalidatesthe contribution of dozens of previously published papers. We willjustify our claim with a theorem, illustrative examples, and acomprehensive set of experiments on reimplementations ofprevious work.},

    abstract = {We develop an event detection framework that has two significant  advantages over past work. First, we introduce an  extended set of time-wise and object-wise statistical features  including not only the trajectory coordinates but also  the histograms and {HMM} based representations of object's  speed, orientation, location, size, and aspect ratio. These  features enable detection of events that cannot be detected  with the existing trajectory features reported so far. Second,  we introduce a spectral clustering algorithm that can automatically  estimate the optimal number of clusters. First,  we construct feature-wise affinity matrices from the pair-wise  similarity scores of objects using the extended set of  features. To determine the usual events, we apply eigen-vector  decomposition and obtain object clusters. We show  that the number of eigenvectors used in the decomposition is  proportional to the optimal number of clusters. Unlike the  conventional approaches that try to fit 
predefined models to  events, we analyze the conformity of objects using affinity  matrices to find the unusual events. We improve the feature  selection process by incorporating feature variances.  We prove that the clustering stage is not adversely affected  by high dimensionality of data space. Our simulations with  synthetic and real data reveal that the proposed detection  methods accurately detect usual and unusual events.},

In addition to single stream statistics such as average and standard deviation, we also want to find high correlations among all pairs of streams. A stock market trader might use such a tool to spot arbitrage opportunities. This paper proposes efficient methods for solving this problem based on Discrete Fourier Transforms and a three level time interval hierarchy. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real world financial trading data show that our algorithm beats the direct computation approach by several orders of magnitude. It also improves on previous Fourier Transform approaches by allowing the efficient computation of time-delayed correlation over any size sliding window and any time delay. Correlation also lends itself to an efficient grid-based data structure. The result is the first algorithm that we know of to compute correlations over 
thousands of data streams in real time. The algorithm is incremental, has fixed response time, and can monitor the pairwise correlations of 10,000 streams on a single {PC}. The algorithm is embarrassingly parallelizable.},

The representation consists of piecewise linear segments to represent shape and a weight vector that contains the relative importance of each individual linear segment. In the classification context, the weights are learned automatically as part of the training cycle. In the relevance feedback context, the weights are determined by an interactive and iterative process in which users rate various choices presented to them. Our representation allows a user to define a variety of similarity measures that can be tailored to specific domains.

    abstract = {Time series stored as feature vectors can be indexed by multi-dimensional index trees like {R-Tree} for fast retrieval. Due to the dimensionality curse problem, transformations are applied to time series to reduce the number of dimensions of the feature vectors. Different transformations like Discrete Fourier Transform ({DFT}), Discrete Wavelet Transform ({DWT}), {Karhunen-Loeve} ({K-L}) transform or Singular Value Decomposition ({SVD}) can be applied. While the use of {DFT} and {K-L} transform or {SVD} have been studied in the literature, to our knowledge, there is no in-depth study on the application of {DWT}. In this paper, we propose to use Haar Wavelet Transform for time series indexing. The major contributions are: (1) we show that Euclidean distance is preserved in the Haar transformed domain and no false dismissal will occur in range query, (2) we show that Haar transform can outperform {DFT} through experiments, (3) a new similarity model is suggested to accommodate vertical shift of 
time series, and (4) a two-phase method is proposed for efficient n-nearest neighbor query in time series databases.},

    abstract = {Feature-based similarity searching is emerging as an important search paradigm in database systems. The technique used is to map the data items as points into a high-dimensional feature space which is indexed using a multidimensional data structure. Similarity searching then corresponds to a range search over the data structure. Although several data structures have been proposed for feature indexing, none of them is known to scale beyond 10-15 dimensional spaces. This paper introduces the hybrid tree-a multidimensional data structure for indexing high-dimensional feature spaces. Unlike other multidimensional data structures, the hybrid tree cannot be classified as either a pure data partitioning ({DP}) index structure (such as the R-tree, {SS}-tree or {SR}-tree) or a pure space partitioning ({SP}) one (such as the {KDB}-tree or {hB}-tree); rather it combines the positive aspects of the two types of index structures into a single data structure to achieve a search performance which is more 
scalable to high dimensionalities than either of the above techniques. Furthermore, unlike many data structures (e.g. distance-based index structures like the {SS}-tree and {SR}-tree), the hybrid tree can support queries based on arbitrary distance functions. Our experiments on \&ldquo;real\&rdquo; high-dimensional large-size feature databases demonstrate that the hybrid tree scales well to high dimensionality and large database sizes. It significantly outperforms both purely {DP}-based and {SP}-based index mechanisms as well as linear scans at all dimensionalities for large-sized databases},

    abstract = {Abstract: The problem of finding patterns of interest in time series databases (query by content) is an important one, with applications in virtually every field of science. A variety of approaches have been suggested. These approaches are robust to noise, offset translation, and amplitude scaling to varying degrees. However, they are all extremely sensitive to scaling in the time axis (longitudinal scaling). We present a method for similarity search that is robust to scaling in the time axis, in addition to noise, offset translation, and amplitude scaling. The method has been tested on medical, financial, space telemetry and artificial data. Furthermore the method is exceptionally fast, with the predicted 2 to 4 orders of magnitude speedup actually observed. The method uses a piecewise linear representation of the original data. We also introduce a new algorithm which both decides the optimal number of linear segments to use, and produces the actual linear representation.},

Starting from a natural similarity  function (the so-called `max morphological  distance\&\#039;), we show how to lower-bound it and  how to search for nearest neighbors in large  collections of tumor-like shapes.  Specifically, we use state-of-the-art concepts  from morphology, namely the `pattern spectrum  \&\#039; of a shape, to map each shape to a point  in n-dimensional space. Following [16, 30], we  organize the n-d points in an R-tree. We show  that the L1 (= max) norm in the n-d space  lower-bounds the actual distance. This guarantees  no false dismissals for range queries. In  addition, we present a nearest neighbor algorithm  that also guarantees no false dismissals.

By running numerous experiments in a standardized testbed under highly varying data, queries and operations, we were able to design the R * -tree which incorporates a combined optimization of area, margin and overlap of each enclosing rectangle in the directory. Using our standardized testbed in an exhaustive performance comparison, it turned out that the R * -tree clearly outperforms the existing R-tree variants. Guttman's linear and quadratic R-tree and Greene's variant of the R-tree. This superiority of the R * -tree holds for different types of queries and operations, such as map overlay, for both rectangles and multidimensional points in all experiments. From a practical point of view the R * -tree is very attractive because of the following two reasons 1 it efficiently supports point and spatial data at the same time and 2 
its implementation cost is only slightly higher than that of other R-trees.},

Like all other feature-based indexing methods, our method maps each sequence into a point in K dimensional space, where K is the number of extracted features for the sequence. It operates in two phases, hypothesizing and verification. Lengths and moments (mean and variance) of sequences are used as features. Experimental results indicate that the features and proposed method for query processing do well as a filter.},

    abstract = {The purpose of subsequence matching is to find a query sequence from a long data sequence. Due to the abundance of applications, many solutions have been proposed. Virtually all previous solutions use the Euclidean measure as the basis for measuring distance between sequences. Recent studies, however, suggest that the Euclidean distance often fails to produce proper results due to the irregularity in the data, which is not so uncommon in our problem domain. Addressing this problem, some {non-Euclidean} measures, such as Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) and Longest Common Subsequence ({LCS}), have been proposed. However, most of the previous work in this direction focused on the whole sequence matching problem where query and data sequences are the same length. In this paper, we propose a novel subsequence matching framework using a {non-Euclidean} measure, in particular, {LCS}, and a new index query scheme. The proposed framework is based on the Dual Match framework where data sequences are 
divided into a series of disjoint equi-length subsequences and then indexed in an R-tree. We introduced similarity bound for index matching with {LCS}. The proposed query matching scheme reduces significant numbers of false positives in the match result. Furthermore, we developed an algorithm to skip expensive {LCS} computations through observing the warping paths. We validated our framework through extensive experiments using 48 different time series datasets. The results of the experiments suggest that our approach significantly improves the subsequence matching performance in various metrics.},

    abstract = {Jagadish et al. (see Proc. {ACM} {SIGACT}-{SIGMOD}-{SIGART} {PODS}, p.36-45, 1995) developed a general framework for posing queries based on similarity. The framework enables a formal definition of the notion of similarity for an application domain of choice, and then its use in queries to perform similarity-based search. We adapt this framework to the specialized domain of real-valued sequences. (Although some of the ideas we present are applicable to other types of data as well). In particular we focus on whole-match queries. By whole-match query we mean the case where the user has to specify the whole sequence. Similarity-based search can be computationally very expensive. The computation cost depends heavily on the length of sequences being compared. To make such similarity testing feasible on large data sets, we propose the use of a signature based technique. In a nutshell, our approach is to \&ldquo;shrink\&rdquo; the data sequences into signatures, and search the signatures instead of 
the real sequences, with further comparison being required only when a possible match is indicated. Being shorter, signatures can usually be compared much faster than the original sequences. In addition, signatures are usually easier to index. For such a signature-based technique to be effective one has to assure that (1) the signature comparison is fast, and (2) the signature comparison gives few false alarms, and no false dismissals. We obtain measures of goodness for our technique. The technique is illustrated with a couple of very different examples},

Nevertheless, it is more unfortunate that {DTW} has a quadratic time and the false dismissals are come forth since {DTW} distance does not satisfy the triangular inequality. In this paper, we propose an efficient range query algorithm based on a new similarity search method under time warping. When our range query applies for this method, it can remove the significant non-qualify time series as early as possible. Hence, it speeds up the calculation time and reduces the number of scanning the time series. Guaranteeing no false dismissals the lower bounding function is advised that consistently underestimate the {DTW} distance and satisfy the triangular inequality.

query algorithm outperforms the existing others.},

While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from two fatal flaws. First, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Second, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. In this work we formulate a new symbolic representation of time 
series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. In particular, we will demonstrate the utility of our representation on various data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content, anomaly detection, motif discovery, and visualization.},

    abstract = {Similarity-based search over time-series databases has been a hot research topic for a long history, which is widely used in many applications, including multimedia retrieval, data mining, web search and retrieval, and so on. However, due to high dimensionality (i.e. length) of the time series, the similarity search over directly indexed time series usually encounters a serious problem, known as the "dimensionality curse". Thus, many dimensionality reduction techniques are proposed to break such curse by reducing the dimensionality of time series. Among all the proposed methods, only  Piecewise Linear Approximation  ({PLA}) does not have indexing mechanisms to support similarity queries, which prevents it from efficiently searching over very large time-series databases. Our initial studies on the effectiveness of different reduction methods, however, show that {PLA} performs no worse than others. Motivated by this, in this paper, we re-investigate {PLA} for approximating and indexing time 
series. Specifically, we propose a novel distance function in the reduced {PLA}-space, and prove that this function indeed results in a lower bound of the Euclidean distance between the original time series, which can lead to no  false dismissals  during the similarity search. As a second step, we develop an effective approach to index these lower bounds to improve the search efficiency. Our extensive experiments over a wide spectrum of real and synthetic data sets have demonstrated the efficiency and effectiveness of {PLA} together with the newly proposed lower bound distance, in terms of both  pruning power  and  wall clock time , compared with two state-of-the-art reduction methods,  Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation  ({APCA}) and  Chebyshev Polynomials  ({CP}).},

This class includes the most popular and most effective wavelets being used in image compression. We present a detailed performance study of the effects of using different wavelets on the performance of similarity search for time-series data. We include several wavelets that outperform both the Haar wavelet and the best known non-wavelet transformations for this application.

We use the Discrete Fourier Transform ({DFT}) to map time sequences to the frequency domain, the crucial observation being that, for most sequences of practical interest, only the first few frequencies are strong. Another important observation is Parseval's theorem, which specifies that the Fourier transform preserves the Euclidean distance in the time or frequency domain. Having thus mapped sequences to a lower-dimensionality space by using only the first few Fourier coefficients, we use R * -trees to index the sequences and efficiently answer similarity queries. We provide experimental results which show that our method is superior to search based on sequential scanning. Our experiments show that a few coefficients (1–3) are adequate to provide good performance. The performance gain of our method increases with the number and length of sequences.},

An efficient motif discovery algorithm for time series would be useful as a tool for summarizing and visualizing massive time series databases. In addition, it could be used as a subroutine in various other data mining tasks, including the discovery of association rules, clustering and classification.

    abstract = {Similarity search in large time series databases has attracted much research interest recently. It is a difficult problem because of the typically high dimensionality of the data. The most promising solutions involve performing dimensionality reduction on the data, then indexing the reduced data with a multidimensional index structure. Many dimensionality reduction techniques have been proposed, including Singular Value Decomposition ({SVD}), the Discrete Fourier transform ({DFT}), and the Discrete Wavelet Transform ({DWT}). In this article, we introduce a new dimensionality reduction technique, which we call Adaptive Piecewise Constant Approximation ({APCA}). While previous techniques (e.g., {SVD}, {DFT} and {DWT}) choose a common representation for all the items in the database that minimizes the global reconstruction error, {APCA} approximates each time series by a set of constant value segments of varying lengths such that their individual reconstruction errors are minimal. We show how {
APCA} can be indexed using a multidimensional index structure. We propose two distance measures in the indexed space that exploit the high fidelity of {APCA} for fast searching: a lower bounding Euclidean distance approximation, and a non-lower-bounding, but very tight, Euclidean distance approximation, and show how they can support fast exact searching and even faster approximate searching on the same index structure. We theoretically and empirically compare {APCA} to all the other techniques and demonstrate its superiority.},

    abstract = {The parallel explosions of interest in streaming data, and data mining of time series have had surprisingly little intersection. This is in spite of the fact that time series data are typically streaming data. The main reason for this apparent paradox is the fact that the vast majority of work on streaming data explicitly assumes that the data is discrete, whereas the vast majority of time series data is real {valued.Many} researchers have also considered transforming real valued time series into symbolic representations, nothing that such representations would potentially allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities, in addition to allowing formerly "batch-only" problems to be tackled by the streaming community. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from three fatal flaws. Firstly, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is 
the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Secondly, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. Finally, most of these symbolic approaches require one to have access to all the data, before creating the symbolic representation. This last feature explicitly thwarts efforts to use the representations with streaming {algorithms.In} this work we introduce a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation,
 while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. Finally, our representation allows the real valued data to be converted in a streaming fashion, with only an infinitesimal time and space {overhead.We} will demonstrate the utility of our representation on the classic data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content and anomaly detection.},

    abstract = {In this digital age, great interest has been shifted toward multimedia data manipulations. This includes videos, images, and audios, where typical manipulations require fairly large storage and are computationally intensive. Recent research has demonstrated the utilities of time series representation in various data mining tasks, allowing considerable reduction in time and space complexity. Specifically, the utilities of Uniform Scaling ({US}) and Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) have been shown to be necessary in several human-related domains, where uniform stretching or shrinking, as well as some local variation are typical. Classic examples include a query-by-humming system and motion capture data. However, all the past work has neglected the importance of data normalization before distance calculations, and therefore does not guarantee accurate retrievals. In this work, we discuss this concern and present a technique that accurately and efficiently searches under the {US} with {DTW} for 
normalized time series data, where no-false-dismissals are guaranteed.},

    abstract = {We address the handling of time series search based on two important distance definitions: Euclidean distance and time warping distance. The conventional method reduces the dimensionality by means of a discrete Fourier transform. We apply the Haar wavelet transform technique and propose the use of a proper normalization so that the method can guarantee no false dismissal for Euclidean distance. We found that this method has competitive performance from our experiments. Euclidean distance measurement cannot handle the time shifts of patterns. It fails to match the same rise and fall patterns of sequences with different scales. A distance measure that handles this problem is the time warping distance. However, the complexity of computing the time warping distance function is high. Also, as time warping distance is not a metric, most indexing techniques would not guarantee any false dismissal. We propose efficient strategies to mitigate the problems of time warping. We suggest a Haar wavelet-
based approximation function for time warping distance, called Low Resolution Time Warping, which results in less computation by trading off a small amount of accuracy. We apply our approximation function to similarity search in time series databases, and show by experiment that it is highly effective in suppressing the number of false alarms in similarity search.},

Trajectories are complex spatio-temporal constructs characterized by diverse non-trivial properties. To assess the degree of (dis)similarity between trajectories, specific methods (distance functions) are required. A single distance function accounting for all properties of trajectories, (1) is difficult to build, (2) would require much time to compute, and (3) might be difficult to understand and to use. We suggest the procedure of progressive clustering where a simple distance function with a clear meaning is applied on each step, which leads to easily interpretable outcomes. Successive application of several different functions enables sophisticated analyses through gradual refinement of earlier obtained results. Besides the advantages from the sense-making perspective, progressive 
clustering enables a rational work organization where time-consuming computations are applied to relatively small potentially interesting subsets obtained by means of 'cheap' distance functions producing quick results. We introduce the concept of progressive clustering by an example of analyzing a large real data set. We also review the existing clustering methods, describe the method {OPTICS} suitable for progressive clustering of trajectories, and briefly present several distance functions for trajectories.},

This uses a brute force approach to the prediction of stock prices based on the formation of a cluster around the query sequence.

well-known longest common subsequence algorithms (for two input strings)

performance of the methods depends heavily on the properties of the
problem instance as well as the supporting data structures used in the
implementation. We want to make also a clear distinction between methods
that determine the actual lcs and those calculating only its length,
since the execution time and more importantly, the space demand depends
crucially on the type of the task. To our knowledge, this is the first
time this kind of survey has been done. Due to the page limits, the
paper gives only a coarse overview of the performance of the algorithms;
more detailed studies are reported elsewhere},

    abstract = {Monitoring predefined patterns in streaming time series is useful to applications such as trend-related analysis, sensor networks and video surveillance. Most current studies on such monitoring employ Euclidean distance to calculate the similarities between given query patterns and subsequences of streaming time series. Euclidean distance has been shown to be ineffective in measuring distances of time series in which shifting and scaling usually exist. Consequently, warping distances such as dynamic time warping ({DTW}), longest common subsequence ({LCSS}), have been proposed to handle warps in temporal dimension. However, they are inadequate in handling shifting and scaling in amplitude dimension. Moreover, they have been designed mainly for full sequence matching, whereas in online monitoring applications, we typically have no knowledge on the positions and lengths of possible matching subsequences. In this paper, we first discuss the weaknesses of existing warping distances on detecting 
patterns from streaming time series. We then propose a novel warping distance, which we name Spatial Assembling Distance ({SpADe}), that is able to handle shifting and scaling in both temporal and amplitude dimensions. We further propose an efficient approach for continuous pattern detection using {SpADe}, that is fundamental for subsequence matching on streaming data. Finally, our experimental results show that {SpADe} is effective and efficient for continuous pattern detection in streaming time series.},

    abstract = {In a way similar to the string-to-string correction problem, we address discrete time series similarity in light of a time-series-to-time-series-correction problem for which the similarity between two time series is measured as the minimum cost sequence of edit operations needed to transform one time series into another. To define the edit operations, we use the paradigm of a graphical editing process and end up with a dynamic programming algorithm that we call time warp edit distance ({TWED}). {TWED} is slightly different in form from dynamic time warping ({DTW}), longest common subsequence ({LCSS}), or edit distance with real penalty ({ERP}) algorithms. In particular, it highlights a parameter that controls a kind of stiffness of the elastic measure along the time axis. We show that the similarity provided by {TWED} is a potentially useful metric in time series retrieval applications since it could benefit from the triangular inequality property to speed up the retrieval process while 
tuning the parameters of the elastic measure. In that context, a lower bound is derived to link the matching of time series into down sampled representation spaces to the matching into the original space. The empiric quality of the {TWED} distance is evaluated on a simple classification task. Compared to edit distance, {DTW}, {LCSS}, and {ERP}, {TWED} has proved to be quite effective on the considered experimental task.},

They make ingredients and relations explicit, guide thinking processes of the designer or scientist, and support communications, often across the boundaries of disciplines. In the fields of cognitive psychology and human-machine interaction, block diagrams have been a dominant means for representing cognitive systems. However, we believe that this form of representation may constrain how we think about cognition in undesirable ways. This form of representation biases viewers to see cognition as a sequential, step-by-step process, under emphasizing the dynamical properties of closed-loop, adaptive processes. Block diagrams emphasize activity and internal mental operations (awareness) and occlude the ecological or work domain (situational) constraints},

More recently, it has been shown that for some problems, Uniform Scaling ({US}), a technique that allows global scaling of time series, may just be as important for some problems. In this work, we note that for many real world problems, it is necessary to combine both {DTW} and {US} to achieve meaningful results. This is particularly true in domains where we must account for the natural variability of human action, including biometrics, query by humming, motion-capture/animation, and handwriting recognition.

    abstract = {Periodicity mining is used for predicting trends in time series data. Discovering the rate at which the time series is periodic has always been an obstacle for fully automated periodicity mining. Existing periodicity mining algorithms assume that the periodicity rate (or simply the period) is user-specified. This assumption is a considerable limitation, especially in time series data where the period is not known a priori. In this paper, we address the problem of detecting the periodicity rate of a time series database. Two types of periodicities are defined, and a scalable, computationally efficient algorithm is proposed for each type. The algorithms perform in O(n\log n) time for a time series of length n. Moreover, the proposed algorithms are extended in order to discover the periodic patterns of unknown periods at the same time without affecting the time complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are highly accurate with respect to the discovered periodicity rates 
and periodic patterns. Real-data experiments demonstrate the practicality of the discovered periodic patterns.},

commands used to produce them. An extensive R package, {TSA}, which contains
many new or revised R functions and all of the data used in the book,
accompanies the written text. Script files of R commands for each chapter are
available for download. There is also an extensive appendix in the book that
leads the reader through the use of R commands and the new R package to carry
out the analyses.},

The aim is to provide specific techniques for handling data and at the same time to provide a thorough understanding of the mathematical basis for techniques. Both time and frequency domain methods are discussed, but the book is written in such a way that either approach could be emphasized. The book intended to be a text for graduate students in statistics, mathematics, engineering, and the natural or social sciences. It contains substantial chapters on multivariate series and state-space models (including applications of the Kalman recursions to missing-value problems) and shorter accounts of special topics including long-range dependence, infinite variance processes and non-linear models.

applied to macroeconomic and financial time series. It attempts to bridge the
gap between methods and realistic applications. This book contains the most
important approaches to analyse time series which may be stationary or
nonstationary. Modelling and forecasting univariate time series is the
starting point. For multiple stationary time series Granger causality tests
and vector autoregressive models are presented. For real applied work the
modelling of nonstationary uni- or multivariate time series is most important.
Therefore, unit root and cointegration analysis as well as vector error
correction models play a central part. Modelling volatilities of financial
time series with autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic models is also
treated.},

@article{citeulike:2090933,
    abstract = {Time series data, due to their numerical and continuous nature, are difficult to process, analyze, and mine. However, these tasks become easier when the data can be transformed into meaningful symbols. Most recent works on time series only address how to identify a given pattern from a time series and do not consider the problem of identifying a suitable set of time points for segmenting the time series in accordance with a given set of pattern templates (e.g., a set of technical patterns for stock analysis). However, the use of fixed-length segmentation is an oversimplified approach to this problem; hence, a dynamic approach (with high controllability) is preferable so that the time series can be segmented flexibly and effectively according to the needs of the users and the applications. In view of the fact that this segmentation problem is an optimization problem and evolutionary computation is an appropriate tool to solve it, we propose an evolutionary time series segmentation algorithm. 
This approach allows a sizeable set of pattern templates to be generated for mining or query. In addition, defining similarity between time series (or time series segments) is of fundamental importance in fitness computation. By identifying the perceptually important points directly from the time domain, time series segments and templates of different lengths can be compared and intuitive pattern matching can be carried out in an effective and efficient manner. Encouraging experimental results are reported from tests that segment both artificial time series generated from the combinations of pattern templates and the time series of selected Hong Kong stocks.},

    abstract = {This collection of twenty-three original papers represents the first effort to
bring together the work of constraint programming researchers scattered across
multiple disciplines and across the world. The collection contributes to the
understanding of the common principles of this emerging general paradigm, the
investigation of its theoretical foundations as well as applications to real-
world computing problems. It is organized around themes of concurrency and
reactive systems, languages and environments, algorithms, computer graphics,
and artificial intelligence. Constraint programming aims at supporting a wide
range of complex applications which are often modeled naturally in terms of
constraints. Early work, in the 1960s and 1970s, made use of constraints in
computer graphics, user interfaces, and artificial intelligence. Such work
introduced a declarative component in otherwise-procedural systems to reduce
the development effort. The mid-1980s have witnessed the emergence of general-
purpose programming languages based on constraints, such as constraint logic
programming and concurrent constraint programming, with significant
applications in academia and industry. Today, an increasing number of
researchers from all over the map of computing are looking at different
aspects of this new computational paradigm.},

Previous query by humming systems have not provided satisfactory results for various reasons. Some systems have low retrieval precision because they rely on melodic contour information from the hum tune, which in turn relies on the error-prone note segmentation process. Some systems yield better precision when matching the melody directly from audio, but they are slow because of their extensive use of Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}). Our approach improves both the retrieval precision and speed compared to previous approaches. We treat music as a time series and exploit and improve well-developed techniques from time series databases to index the music for fast similarity queries. We improve on existing {DTW} indexes technique by introducing the concept of  envelope transforms , which gives a general guideline for extending existing dimensionality reduction methods to {DTW} indexes.
 The net result is high scalability. We confirm our claims through extensive experiments.},

    abstract = {The problem of finding patterns of interest in time series databases (query by content) is an important one, with applications in virtually every field of science. A variety of approaches have been suggested. These approaches are robust to noise, offset translation, and amplitude scaling to varying degrees. However, they are all extremely sensitive to scaling in the time axis (longitudinal scaling). We present a method for similarity search that is robust to scaling in the time axis, in addition to noise, offset translation, and amplitude scaling. The method has been tested on medical, financial, space telemetry and artificial data. Furthermore the method is exceptionally fast, with the predicted 2 to 4 orders of magnitude speedup actually observed. The method uses a piecewise linear representation of the original data. We also introduce a new algorithm which both decides the optimal number of linear segments to use, and produces the actual linear representation},

The model allows the amplitude of one of the two sequences to be scaled by any suitable amount and its offset adjusted appropriately. Two subsequences are considered similar if one can be enclosed within an envelope of a specified width drawn around the other. The model also allows non-matching gaps in the matching subsequences. The matching subsequences need not be aligned along the time axis. Given this model of similarity, we present fast search techniques for discovering all similar sequences in a set of sequences. These techniques can also be used to find all (sub)sequences similar to a given sequence. We applied this matching system to the {U.S}. mutual funds data and discovered interesting matches.},

    abstract = {Motivation: Increasingly, biological processes are being studied   through time series of {RNA} expression data collected for large   numbers of genes. Because common processes may unfold at varying   rates in different experiments or individuals, methods are needed that will allow corresponding expression states in different time series to be mapped to one another.  Results: We present implementations of time warping algorithms   applicable to {RNA} and protein expression data and demonstrate their application to published yeast {RNA} expression time series. Programs executing two warping algorithms are described, a simple warping algorithm and an interpolative algorithm, along with programs that generate graphics that visually present alignment information. We show time warping to be superior to simple clustering at mapping corresponding time states. We document the impact of statistical measurement noise and sample size on the quality of time alignments,  and present issues related to 
statistical assessment of alignment   quality through alignment scores. We also discuss directions for algorithm improvement including development of multiple time series alignments and possible applications to causality searches and non-temporal processes ( concentration warping').

In the first part of this paper we demonstrate that the operations of {Query-by-Example} can be used not only to query the data base but also to define it, including data descriptions and declarations of various integrity constraints. This is an attempt to provide the user with a simplified, unified interface for a variety of functions. In the second part of this paper it is shown how one can make preliminary interrogations to retrieve a subset of the data base needed for the formulation of a specific query. This becomes very useful in cases where the data-base is very large and the user's initial task of scanning the tables for the ones relevant to his specific query becomes by itself horrendous.},

This problem is of great practical importance given the massive volume of streaming time series available through sensors, medical patient records, financial indices and space telemetry. Since the data may arrive at a high rate and the number of predefined patterns can be relatively large, it may be impossible for the comparison algorithm to keep up. We propose a novel technique that exploits the commonality among the predefined patterns to allow monitoring at higher bandwidths, while maintaining a guarantee of no false dismissals. Our approach is based on the widely used envelope-based lower-bounding technique. As we will demonstrate on extensive experiments in diverse domains, our approach achieves tremendous improvements in performance in the offline case, and significant improvements in the fastest possible arrival rate of the 
data stream that can be processed with guaranteed no false dismissals. As a further demonstration of the utility of our approach, we demonstrate that it can make semisupervised learning of time series classifiers tractable.},

    abstract = {After the generation of multimedia data turned digital, an explosion of interest in their data storage, retrieval, and processing has drastically increased. This includes videos, images, and audios, where we now have higher expectations in exploiting these data at hands. Typical manipulations are in some forms of video/image/audio processing, including automatic speech recognition, which require fairly large amount of storage and are computationally intensive. In our recent work, we have demonstrated the utility of time series representation in the task of clustering multimedia data using k-medoids method, which allows considerable amount of reduction in computational effort and storage space. However, k- means is a much more generic clustering method when Euclidean distance is used. In this work, we will demonstrate that unfortunately, k-means clustering will sometimes fail to give correct results, an unaware fact that may be overlooked by many researchers. This is especially the case when 
Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) is used as the distance measure in averaging the shape of time series. We also will demonstrate that the current averaging algorithm may not produce the real average of the time series, thus generates incorrect k-means clustering results, and then show potential causes why {DTW} averaging methods may not achieve meaningful clustering results. Lastly, we conclude with a suggestion of a method to potentially find the shape-based time series average that satisfies the required properties.},

    abstract = {Fast similarity searching in large time sequence databases has typically used Euclidean distance as a dissimilarity metric. However, for several applications, including matching of voice, audio and medical signals (e.g., electrocardiograms), one is required to permit local accelerations and decelerations in the rate of sequences, leading to a popular, field tested dissimilarity metric called the \&ldquo;time warping\&rdquo; distance. From the indexing viewpoint, this metric presents two major challenges: (a) it does not lead to any natural indexable \&ldquo;features\&rdquo;, and (b) comparing two sequences requires time quadratic in the sequence length. To address each problem, we propose to use: (a) a modification of the so called \&{ldquo;FastMap}\&rdquo;, to map sequences into points, with little compromise of \&ldquo;recall\&rdquo; (typically zero); and (b) a fast linear test, to help us discard quickly many of the false alarms that {FastMap} will typically introduce. Using both ideas in 
cascade, our proposed method achieved up to an order of magnitude speed-up over sequential scanning on both real and synthetic datasets},

This is done by means of a variety of modes of information (visual, audio, pen, etc.) either used individually or in combination. In this work, we focus on the visual sensory information to recognize human activity in form of hand-arm movements from a small, predefined vocabulary. We accomplish this task by means of a matching technique by determining the distance between the unknown input and a set of previously defined templates. A dynamic time warping ({DTW}) algorithm is used to perform the time alignment and normalization by computing a temporal transformation allowing the two signals to be matched. The system is trained with finite video sequences of single gesture performances whose start and end point are accurately known. Preliminary experiments are accomplished off-line and result in a recognition accuracy of up to 92\%.},

Nevertheless, typical content-based search for multimedia data usually requires a large amount of storages and is computationally intensive. Recently, time series representation has been successfully applied to a wide variety of research, including multimedia retrieval due to the great reduction in time and space complexity. Besides, an enhancement, Uniform Scaling, has been proposed and applied prior to distance calculation, as well as it has been demonstrated that Uniform Scaling can outperform Euclidean distance. These previous work on Uniform Scaling, 
nonetheless, overlook the importance and effects of normalisation, which make their frameworks impractical for real world data. Therefore, in this paper, we justify this importance of normalisation in multimedia data and propose an efficient solution for searching multimedia time series data under Uniform Scaling and normalisation.},

It can handle general classification problems that rely on this sequential type of data, e.g., speech recognition, genome processing, robotics, etc. Contrary to previous attempts, clustering and statistical sequence modeling are embedded in a single feature space and use a closely related distance measure. We show character recognition experiments of frog on hand using {CSDTW} on the {UNIPEN} online handwriting database.

    abstract = {Poor handwriting is a diagnostic criterion for developmental coordination disorder. Typical of poor handwriting is its low overall quality and the high variability of the spatial characteristics of the letters, usually assessed with a subjective handwriting scale. Recently, Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}), a technique originally developed for speech recognition, was introduced for pattern recognition in handwriting. The present study evaluates its application to analyze poor handwriting. Forty children attending Dutch mainstream primary schools were recruited and based on their scores on the Concise Evaluation Scale for Children's Handwriting (Dutch abbreviation: {BHK}), 20 good and 20 poor writers (of whom 13 were scheduled for handwriting intervention) were identified. The groups were matched for age (7-9 years), school grade (grades 2 and 3) and handedness. The children subsequently wrote sequences of the letter "a" on a graphics tablet in three conditions (normal, fast, and accurate). 
Classical kinematics were obtained and for each individual letter {DTW} was used to calculate the distance from the mean shape. The {DTW} data revealed much higher variability in the letter forms of the poor writers that was independent of the kinematic results of larger trajectories, faster movements, and higher pen pressure. The current results suggest that {DTW} is a valid and objective technique for letter-form analysis in handwriting and may hence be useful to evaluate the rehabilitation treatments of children suffering from poor handwriting. In education research it may be exploited to explore how children (should) learn to write.},

In this paper we introduce {FastDTW}, an approximation of {DTW} that has a linear time and space complexity. {FastDTW} uses a multilevel approach that recursively projects a solution from a coarser resolution and refines the projected solution. We prove the linear time and space complexity of {FastDTW} both theoretically and empirically. We also analyze the accuracy of {FastDTW} by comparing it to two other types of existing approximate {DTW} algorithms: constraints (such as {Sakoe-Chiba} Bands) and abstraction. Our results show a large improvement in accuracy over existing methods.},

The {DTW}-algorithm originates from the field of speech recognition, and has been applied successfully in the signature verification area more than once. However, until now, few adaptations have been made in order to take the specific characteristics of signature verification into account. According to us, one of the most important differences is the availability of a rather large number of reference patterns, making it possible to determine which parts of a reference signature are important and which are not. By disconnecting the {DTW}-stage and the feature extraction process we are able to deal efficiently with this extra amount of information. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by building and evaluating a complete system},

    abstract = {Despite their known weaknesses, hidden Markov models ({HMMs}) have been the dominant technique for acoustic modeling in speech recognition for over two decades. Still, the advances in the {HMM} framework have not solved its key problems: it discards information about time dependencies and is prone to overgeneralization. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these problems by relying on straightforward template matching. The basis for the recognizer is the well-known {DTW} algorithm. However, classical {DTW} continuous speech recognition results in an explosion of the search space. The traditional top-down search is therefore complemented with a data-driven selection of candidates for {DTW} alignment. We also extend the {DTW} framework with a flexible subword unit mechanism and a class sensitive distance measure-two components suggested by state-of-the-art {HMM} systems. The added flexibility of the unit selection in the template-based framework leads to new approaches to speaker and 
environment adaptation. The template matching system reaches a performance somewhat worse than the best published {HMM} results for the Resource Management benchmark, but thanks to complementarity of errors between the {HMM} and {DTW} systems, the combination of both leads to a decrease in word error rate with 17\% compared to the {HMM} results},

    abstract = {For many performance analysis problems, the ability to reason across traces is invaluable. However, due to non-determinism in the {OS} and virtual machines, even two identical runs of an application yield slightly different traces. For example, it is unlikely that two identical runs of an application will suffer context switches at exactly the same points. These sorts of variations across traces make it difficult to reason across traces. This paper describes and evaluates an algorithm, dynamic time warping ({DTW}) that can be used to align traces, thus enabling us to reason across traces. While {DTW} comes from prior work our use of {DTW} is novel. Also we describe and evaluate an enhancement to {DTW} that significantly improves the quality of its alignments. Our results show that for applications whose performance varies significantly over time, {DTW} does a great job at aligning the traces. For applications whose performance stays largely constant for significant periods of time, the 
original {DTW} does not perform well; however, our enhanced {DTW} performs much better.},

We compare the methods to find their suitability for an on-line form-filling application in writer dependent, independent and adaptive scenarios. The comparison is in terms of average recognition accuracy and the number of training samples required to obtain an acceptable performance. While the first criterion evaluates effective recognition capability of a scheme, the second one is important for studying the effectiveness of a scheme in real time applications.

    abstract = {One of the most challenging areas in the field of automatic control is the design of automatic control devices that 'learn' to improve their performamce based upon experience, i.e., that can adapt themselves to circumstances as they find them. The military and commercial implications of such devices are impressive, and interest in the two main areas of research in the field of control, the {USA} and the {USSR}, runs high. Unfortunately, though, both theory and construction of adaptive controllers are in their infancy, and some time may pass before they are commonplace. Nonetheless, development at this time of adequate theories of processes of this nature is essential. The purpose of our paper is to show how the functional equation technique of a new mathematical discipline, dynamic programming, can be used in the formulation and solution of a variety of optimization problems concerning the design of adaptive devices. Although, occasionally, a solution in closed form can be obtained, in 
general, numerical solution via the use of high-speed digital computers is contemplated. We discuss here the closely allied problems of formulating adaptive control processes in precise mathematical terms and of presenting feasible computational algoritbms for determining numerical solutioms. To illustrate the general concepts, consider a system which is governed by the inhomogeneous Van der Pol equation},

Stretching of sequences in time is allowed, as well as global translation of the sequences in space. Efficient approximate algorithms that compute these similarity measures are also provided.

    abstract = {The technique of dynamic programming for the time registration of a reference and a test pattern has found widespread use in the area of isolated word recognition. Recently, a number of variations on the basic time warping algorithm have been proposed by Sakoe and Chiba, and Rabiner, Rosenberg, and Levinson. These algorithms all assume that the test input is the time pattern of a feature vector from an isolated word whose endpoints are known (at least approximately). The major differences in the methods are the global path constraints (i.e., the region of possible warping paths), the local continuity constraints on the path, and the distance weighting and normalization used to give the overall minimum distance. The purpose of this investigation is to study the effects of such variations on the performance of different dynamic time warping algorithms for a realistic speech database. The performance measures that were used include: speed of operation, memory requirements, and recognition 
accuracy. The results show that both axis orientation and relative length of the reference and the test patterns are important factors in recognition accuracy. Our results suggest a new approach to dynamic time warping for isolated words in which both the reference and test patterns are linearly warped to a fixed length, and then a simplified dynamic time warping algorithm is used to handle the nonlinear component of the time alignment. Results with this new algorithm show performance comparable to or better than that of all other dynamic time warping algorithms that were studied.},

    abstract = {To recognize speech, handwriting or sign language, many hybrid approaches have been proposed that combine Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}) or Hidden Markov Models ({HMM}) with discriminative classifiers. However, all methods rely directly on the likelihood models of {DTW}/{HMM}. We hypothesize that time warping and classification should be separated because of conflicting likelihood modelling demands. To overcome these restrictions, we propose to use Statistical {DTW} ({SDTW}) only for time warping, while classifying the warped features with a different method. Two novel statistical classifiers are proposed ({CDFD} and {Q-DFFM}), both using a selection of discriminative features ({DF}), and are shown to outperform {HMM} and {SDTW}. However, we have found that combining likelihoods of multiple models in a second classification stage degrades performance of the proposed classifiers, while improving performance with {HMM} and {SDTW}. A proof-of-concept experiment, combining {DFFM} mappings of 
multiple {SDTW} models with {SDTW} likelihoods, shows that also for model-combining, hybrid classification can provide significant improvement over {SDTW}. Although recognition is mainly based on {3D} hand motion features, these results can be expected to generalize to recognition with more detailed measurements such as hand/body pose and facial expression.},

    abstract = {Continuously monitoring through time the correlation/distance of multiple data streams is of interest in a variety of applications, including financial analysis, video surveillance, and mining of biological data. However, distance measures commonly adopted for comparing time series, such as Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping ({DTW}), either are known to be inaccurate or are too time-consuming to be applied in a streaming environment. In this paper we propose a novel {DTW}-like distance measure, called {Stream-DTW} ({SDTW}), which unlike {DTW} can be efficiently updated at each time step. We formally and experimentally demonstrate that {SDTW} speeds up the monitoring process by a factor that grows linearly with the size of the window sliding over the streams. For instance, with a sliding window of 512 samples, {SDTW} is about 600 times faster than {DTW}. We also show that {SDTW} is a tight approximation of {DTW}, errors never exceeding 10\%, and that it consistently outperforms approximations 
developed for the case of static time series.},

In this context, the choice of suitable local cost or distance measures is of crucial importance, since they determine the kind of (spatial) similarity between the elements (frames) of the two sequences to be aligned. For the mocap domain, we introduce two conceptually different local distance measures – one based on joint angle parameters and the other based on {3D} coordinates – and discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses (Sect. 10.1). The importance of {DTW} is then illustrated by some synthesis and analysis applications (Sect. 10.2). By comparing a motion data stream to itself, one obtains a cost or distance matrix that exhibits self-similarities within the motion. In Sect. 10.3, we describe how this idea can be exploited for motion retrieval. Finally, in Sect. 10.4, we discuss some work related to {DTW}-based motion retrieval.},

Intuitively, the sequences are warped in a nonlinear fashion to match each other. Originally, {DTW} has been used to compare different speech patterns in automatic speech recognition, see [170]. In fields such as data mining and information retrieval, {DTW} has been successfully applied to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data. In this chapter, we introduce and discuss the main ideas of classical {DTW} (Sect. 4.1) and summarize several modifications concerning local as well as global parameters (Sect. 4.2). To speed up classical {DTW}, we describe in Sect. 4.3 a general multiscale {DTW} approach. In Sect. 4.4, we show how {DTW} can be employed to identify all subsequence within a long data stream that are similar to a given query sequence (Sect. 4.4). A discussion of

                Papaya, a fruit crop cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions, is known for its nutritional benefits and medicinal applications. Here we report a 3x draft genome sequence of '{SunUp}' papaya, the first commercial virus-resistant transgenic fruit tree to be sequenced. The papaya genome is three times the size of the Arabidopsis genome, but contains fewer genes, including significantly fewer disease-resistance gene analogues. Comparison of the five sequenced genomes suggests a minimal angiosperm gene set of 13,311. A lack of recent genome duplication, atypical of other angiosperm genomes sequenced so far, may account for the smaller papaya gene number in most functional groups. Nonetheless, striking amplifications in gene number within particular functional groups suggest roles in the evolution of tree-like habit, deposition and remobilization of starch reserves, attraction of seed dispersal agents, and adaptation to tropical daylengths. Transgenesis at three locations is closely 
associated with chloroplast insertions into the nuclear genome, and with topoisomerase I recognition sites. Papaya offers numerous advantages as a system for fruit-tree functional genomics, and this draft genome sequence provides the foundation for revealing the basis of Carica's distinguishing morpho-physiological, medicinal and nutritional properties.

    abstract = {This paper reports on an optimum dynamic progxamming ({DP}) based time-normalization algorithm for spoken word recognition. First, a general principle of time-normalization is given using time-warping function. Then, two time-normalized distance definitions, called symmetric and asymmetric forms, are derived from the principle. These two forms are compared with each other through theoretical discussions and experimental studies. The symmetric form algorithm superiority is established. A new technique, called slope constraint, is successfully introduced, in which the warping function slope is restricted so as to improve discrimination between words in different categories. The effective slope constraint characteristic is qualitatively analyzed, and the optimum slope constraint condition is determined through experiments. The optimized algorithm is then extensively subjected to experimental comparison with various {DP}-algorithms, previously applied to spoken word recognition by different 
research groups. The experiment shows that the present algorithm gives no more than about two-thirds errors, even compared to the best conventional algorithm.},
