\section{Appendix A: Game Mechanics}

The gamification wiki [ref] compiles a comprehensive list of gamification mechanics and categories them into three types (Behavioral, Feedback, Progression) and their benefits in measurable metrics (Engagement, Influence, Loyalty, User Generated Content (UGC), Time Spent, Virality) and other non-metrics ( Fun, Revenue, SEO).

	Feedback & Countdown: players are only given a certain amount of time to do something. This will create an activity graph that causes increased initial activity increasing frenetically until time runs out, which is a forced extinction. & Engagement, Fun, Influence & Achievers, Explorers, Killers \\ \hline	
	Feedback & Quests/Challenges: Challenges usually implies a time limit or competition whereas Quests are meant to be a journey of obstacles a player must overcome. a way to organize player effort. & Engagement, Loyalty, Revenue, Influence, Time Spent, Virality, SEO, Fun, UGC & Achievers, Explorers, Killers \\ \hline

\section {Appendix B:  Game Elements}
Game Elements are different than mechanics, as illustrated in the examples below, they manifest the game information to the player, usually as a UI components.

    \begin{tabular}{ | l | p {12cm} |}
    \hline
    Elements & Description and Examples \\ \hline
	Activity Feed & shows players what has been taking place in the system overall and motivate the player to obtain the same achievement as others. \\ \hline
	Avatars & unique representations for a player. shows a high emotional attachment between the player and the game. often customization and decoration are enhancement for higer engagement. \\ \hline
	Easter Eggs & an intentional hidden message, in-joke. \\ \hline
	Instances & are created for players to have a unique experience that is outside the normal experience. When a player creates a special unique page experience that allows to log into and view their unique content an instance has been created. \\ \hline
	Leaderboards & are a means by which users can track their performance, subjective to others. Leaderboards visually display where a user stands in regards to other users. Leaderboards can be broken down into several subcategories such as: Global, Friends, Relative, Isolated etc. \\ \hline
	The Notifier & is a direct way to give the user direct feedback about their progress, change of status in the gameplay experience etc. \\ \hline
	User Profile & displays a User's data about their activity on a website and can be used to tell the world and a community on the internet who they are. \\ \hline
