This paper presents the Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN), a system designed
to support {\em strong collaboration} among a group as they cooperatively
build, review, revise, improve and learn from a structured hypertext
document.  AEN addresses how strong collaboration can be supported through
computer mediation.  It is designed to support collaborative creation of
hypertext and to instrument the actions of its users in order to understand
how such creation occurs.

\paragraph{KEYWORDS:} Hypertext, Strong Collaboration, Authoring
\section{INTRODUCTION}
With the rapid expansion of the World Wide Web (WWW) \cite{Berners-Lee94},
the use of hypertext as a structuring mechanism for richly interdependent
information is becoming widespread.  Indeed, hypertext is almost certain to
be the `lingua franca' of the information superhighway.  The WWW allows
authors to collaborate by including sections of other authors' documents.
Unfortunately, WWW provides little support for collaborative authoring
beyond including someone else's work.

\section{AEN}

In order to explore the issues associated with collaborative hypertext
document construction we developed the Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN). AEN
is a collaborative authoring tool built upon the Egret \cite{csdl-93-09}
collaborative system development environment.  Specifically, AEN
investigates and supports a form of collaboration termed {\em strong
collaboration}.  In strong collaboration, each participant contributes to
the construction of the document, and gains new knowledge as a direct
result of this construction.  The constructed document is not simply a
patchwork of individual contributions, but instead, an incremental,
emergent synthesis that reflects the knowledge created by the group as a
whole.  In general, strong collaboration most often (though not always)
occurs in non-computer mediated, face-to-face contexts such as a group
software design session or an interactive classroom setting.  A
distinguishing characteristic of strong collaboration is a sense of
collective authorship over most, if not all of the components of the
document.  Documents produced in this way should be of higher quality,
because more perspectives have combined to produce, review, and correct
errors in it.

  {\em This screen shot illustrates some of the support for strong
  collaboration in AEN.  The Snoopy window in the lower right hand corner
  shows, for each user of the system, whether or not they are logged in
  currently and if so, where they are working in the document.  Both user
  cmoore and user jeremyt are working on the document node called
  ``Shared Emacs''.  The Partyline screen, in the lower right hand
  corner, allows these users (as well as all others) to talk to each
  other while they work.  This figure also shows a local TOC for the
  Shared Emacs chapter, and a screen displaying the current set of unread
  document nodes for this user.}

\end{figure*}

The basic premise behind AEN is that strong collaboration can be
enabled and encouraged through computer mediation.  The process of strong
collaboration can be supported by tools that assist the group in their
collaborative process.  Figure \ref{fig:Screen2} shows some of AEN's tools
that support strong collaboration.

AEN provides several generic tools to assist the group in their
collaborative authoring process; typed nodes and links, a simple yet
powerfull access control model for each node, context sensitive tables of
contents, context sensitive node lists, and two tools to support a sense of
``Physical'' presence in the hypertext document.

The typed nodes and links allows the group to create their own hypertext
structure.  The typed nodes and links allows the group do decide on what
consititutes a subdivision

The access control model allows the group to define their own process of
review and revision for the document.  They are able to subdivide their
group as they desire.  The access control model allows the authors of a
node to decide who is able to read, comment on and modify that node.

The tables of contents allow the individual authors to focus on only the
portions of the hypertext document that they are interested in and are able
to view.  The tables of contents also show the users what nodes have
changed since the last time they viewed them.   The node lists also provide
a rapid way of accessing nodes that have changed.

The two tools that provide a ``Physical'' presence in the hypertext
document help promote interaction among the users.  The Snoopy tool allows
the users to see what the other users are doing.  The partyline tool allows
the users to chat with each other.

\section{RECOMMENDATIONS}

Based upon the my experiences with AEN, I recommend the following to
encourage strong collaboration: provide direct and indirect authoring
mechanisms, provide access to intermediate work products, provide
context-sensitive ``what's new,'' and provide mechanisms to allow users as
well as documents to be visible.

My first recommendation is to provide direct and indirect authoring
mechanisms.  AEN supports two methods for collaborative authoring, which I
term {\em proof-reading}(indirect) and {\em trading the lock}(direct).  In
the proof-reading method, the author creates a node and publishes it by
allowing read and annotate access.  This allows others to make comments
suggesting changes, new ideas, or just general comments on the subject.
The author can read the comments and make changes to the document or
comment on the comments.  In the trading the lock method, the author
creates a node and allows other authors to edit it by providing read and
write access.  Each author can lock the node, make a change, save the node,
and unlock it, which updates the contents of the node displayed on each
author's screen.  Strong collaboration is enhanced by providing authors
with these degrees of control over the document and styles of interaction
with others.

My second recommendation is to provide access to intermediate work
products.  One of the strongest enablers of strong collaboration is easy
accessibility to intermediate work products.  Synergy is nurtured by
permission to review another's admittedly rough, first pass at an idea,
where comments and suggestions are aimed at refining and enhancing, rather
than confirming or denying, as is frequently the case with final, polished
presentations.

My third recommendation is to provide context-sensitive ``what's new.''
When a group divides into subgroups and is actively and incrementally
building hypertext documents, context-sensitive mechanisms to automatically
inform users of what has changed are essential. Otherwise, the users will
suffer from either lack of knowledge about what is changing (if no
change-related mechanisms exist) or a low signal-to-noise ratio (if
context-free change-related mechanisms are used, in which case users are
informed of many changes that are irrelevant to them.)  In AEN, the
combination of access control, unread nodes, and Hyperstar Bulletin
provides a very nice means of selectively propagating change-related
information across groups.  The daily Hyperstar Bulletin encourages users
to log in to AEN only when necessary to see changes, and access control
allows users to control the visibility of their changes.

My last recommendation is to provide a mechanism to allow users as well as
artifacts to be visible.  In AEN, providing knowledge of who was using AEN,
where they were, and a means to communicate with them created many new
opportunities for collaboration without requiring face-to-face interaction.

The above recommendations should help enable strong collaboration.
