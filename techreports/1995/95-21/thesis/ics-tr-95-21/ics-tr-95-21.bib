%X  This paper presents the results from an analysis of a new 
computer-mediated communication tool called Flashmail.  
I investigated how people used Flashmail as well as Flashmail's 
relationship to conventional electronic mail.  Participants in 
the experiment loaded extensions that gathered data regarding 
the characteristics of all messages sent through E-mail and 
Flashmail.  This data was used to analyze the conditions under 
which each system was used.  I found that Flashmail seems to be 
preferred whenever the message is short, needs to be communicated 
in a short period of time, and when both the recipient and the 
sender are logged into the system and active at the time of sending.  
In contrast, I found that E-mail was preferred for messages 
that were large (over 400 characters) and non-urgent, or when 
the receiver was either not logged into Flashmail or had been 
idle for longer than 7 minutes.  These results indicate that 
Flashmail is generally used as a rapid, synchronous messaging method.
