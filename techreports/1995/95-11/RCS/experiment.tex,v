\chapter{Experimental Design}
\label{chap:experiment}

This chapter describes the experiment we performed to evaluate the effect of
our system on the sense of community in the Department of Information and
Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii.

\section{Duration of Experiment}
This study lasted from January 10, 1995 to April 30, 1995.  The system, called
WWW-ICS, was publicly released in January, 1995.

\section{Experimental Method}

\subsection{Using Questionnaires to Evaluate Community}
Our operational definition of community is based on feelings people have about
themselves in relation to their organization and on their knowledge of other
members and the group as a whole.  Evaluating community involves asking people
about their feelings and testing their awareness of the organization.  An
efficient way of gathering this information is by administering questionnaires.
Since we were analyzing a change in community, we evaluated it twice to get a
view before and after the introduction of our information system.

The pre-test questionnaire in Appendix \ref{sec:pre-test} asks several
questions regarding people's feelings about themselves and the organization.
Other questions test their knowledge of various elements in the organization.
Recognizing the transitory nature of a university department, we decided it was
worth examining two obvious sub-communities.  We opted to look at the students
as one community and the faculty \& staff, who enjoy a more permanent status,
as another.  So pre-test questionnaires were sent out separately to the
students and to the faculty \& staff.  The questionnaires contained essentially
the same questions except for two that tested awareness of the community as a
whole as well as the sub-communities.

The questionnaires were administered to all undergraduate and graduate students
in the department by hardcopy through their ICS classes.  However, the ICS
faculty received it both through e-mail and as a hardcopy in their mailbox.
Anonymity was important, so all data was kept strictly confidential.  Responses
were turned in to a box in the ICS lounge.  However, for those who did not care
to turn in a hardcopy, an e-mail reply was also accepted.  To generate
interest and participation in this research, we offered an incentive for
completing the questionnaire.  People who responded by email were automatically
entered in a drawing for a prize.  Those who submitted their surveys by
hardcopy detached an entry form from the bottom and turned it in at the same
time.  The prize was a \$30 gift certificate to a local restaurant of the
winner's choosing and was awarded to an undergraduate student, Chris Jackson.
The questionnaire was sent out at approximately the same time the Web server
was publicly released.  See Table \ref{tab:chronology} for the chronology of
events of this experiment.

At the end of the experiment, we sent out post-test questionnaires to determine
the level of community at that time.  The post-test version contained the same
questions as the pre-test one.  There were seven additional questions
pertaining to the information system.  Administration of the post-test
questionnaire was conducted in the same manner as the pre-test questionnaire.
Again, slightly different versions were sent out separately to the faculty \&
staff and to the students.  The faculty and staff received it through email and
by hardcopy in their mailbox.  We compiled a list of email addresses of
students from training sessions conducted throughout the semester.  The student
questionnaires were sent out both through email and through the ICS classes.
Another drawing was held for a gift certificate and was awarded to an
undergraduate, Edward Paul Doyle.  Appendix \ref{sec:post-test} contains the
post-test questionnaire.

\subsection{Adoption of the Information System}
We installed the Web server in August, 1994.  The community-oriented features
mentioned in Chapter \ref{chap:www} were implemented into the system.  At
first, the only users of the information system were the members of this
author's research group.  The release of the system was scheduled for January,
1995.  However, a few faculty members somehow found out about the Web server
and used it to publish course information as well as to create home pages for
themselves.  

Usage of the system took place in two forms.  One was through retrieval of
data.  To retrieve data from our information system, one needed a WWW browser
and knowledge of how to navigate the Web using the browser.  Depending on the
client application, navigation through the information system involved clicking
a mouse, pressing a keyboard button, or typing in a document's URL.  Retrieving
data from the Web is relatively simple compared to the other form of usage,
which is publishing.  Publishing documents on our information system required
knowledge of HTML and simple unix commands pertaining to file processing.

In January 1995, just at the start of the Spring Semester, we publicly released
the information system.  An important factor in this research was
participation.  Without user participation, we could not study how the system
affected the sense of community in the group.  Some students were forced to use
the system since their professors posted lecture notes and assignments online
as opposed to handing them out in class.  But we encouraged all members of the
department to become information publishers themselves.  The first step was to
advertise aggressively.  To start with, all faculty received email informing
them of this research and requesting they give full support in any way
possible.  In return, the author offered her knowledge and skills to help the
faculty on a one-on-one basis to set up personal home pages and/or
course-related pages on the Web.  Flyers were posted on the department bulletin
board and in the halls advertising the existence of an ICS Web Site and
training sessions on how to get involved.  There was no comprehensive
electronic mailing list of undergraduates, so only graduate students were
informed by email.  In addition to the flyers and email messages, information
on how to contribute to the ICS Web Site were made available online to anyone
visiting that site.

In the first month, introductory sessions on the World Wide Web and its
relevance to the ICS department were scheduled approximately twice a week,
for a total of 6 training sessions that month.  These sessions were open to
the faculty, staff and students of the department.  They were designed to
familiarize people with the Web and to demonstrate its simple interface and
usefulness in navigation of the Internet.  Users came away from these classes
with their very own home page.  The author simplified this initial training
by designing a unix shell script that creates a simple Web page for users as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:UserPage}.  The icon near the top of the page
represents an unrendered image.  This was included by default to encourage
users to include their picture in their home page.  The training classes
were designed to get people excited about the Web.  Hopefully, they would be
inspired to learn more about it on their own and modify their home page so
that it became their own creation.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=UserPage.eps}} 
\caption{A screen shot of a user home page.} 
\label{fig:UserPage}
\end{figure}

We avoided talking about the case study during these classes to prevent bias in
the questionnaire responses.  We made no mention of community building and
presented the classes as an introduction to a new means for navigation of the
Internet as well as for information sharing.

%Additionally, the author was asked to give several talks on her research to
%various graduate and undergraduate level classes.

The frequency of initial training sessions died down after a month, with some
getting cancelled due to low enrollment.  There seemed to be less people
interested in learning about the Web and creating home pages.  However, many
people stated that they wanted to do more with the system, but didn't have
enough information to continue.  To accommodate this need for more information,
we began offering new twice-weekly training sessions on advanced HTML.  By this
time, about one third of the faculty put their courses online.  Students of
these professors not only got their education through the training sessions,
but also through the mandatory use of the system demanded by their teachers.
In the last month, we conducted only a few training sessions, each of which had
low enrollment.  The ICS Web server continues to run although its primary
purpose now is to provide information about the department.

\subsection{Using Logfiles for Recordkeeping}
So far, the only method of data collection mentioned is gathering questionnaire
responses.  Users' opinions are important but should not be the sole source of
data.  People can say anything they want to about community or computer
systems.  However, their actions accurately reveal how they used the system.
The server software keeps a log of all incoming requests for documents.
Through these logs, we gathered information about how many home pages were
created.  The logs also showed which members of the department participated in
publishing Web related pages.  In addition to revealing information about
publishers and what they published, they showed access patterns of our
information system.  Study of these patterns indicate the manner in which users
navigated through our database.

\section{Anticipated Outcomes}
Given that the Web is rather new, we assumed that the initial number of Web
users in the department included only a few people.  We anticipated four
possible scenarios in which the information system would affect the sense of
community in this department.

The first possibility is that the computer-based approach would make no
appreciable difference to the level of community.  That is, there would still
remain only a few people using the Web and the level of community would remain
at the status quo.  This could occur due to insufficient advertising or
training and promotion of our Web information system.  Overcoming this obstacle
involves providing better resources and/or more frequent and flexibly-scheduled
training sessions.  Alternatively, this could occur even if users were aware of
the system, were fully knowledgeable about how to use the system, but simply
did not find any utility in it.  If this were the case, then one could argue
that the database was not appropriately designed to promote community within
the department.  In any case, infrequent use of the system would not be
expected to contribute to raising the level of community in the department.

The second possibility is that there were only a few active users of the
system, but that questionnaire responses indicate an increased level of
community.  Again, the reasons behind having only a few users of the system can
be attributed to those as in the first case.  However, we need to discover why
department members felt an increased level of community.  One answer is that
there was an outside factor affecting the level of community and the
computer-based approach had no effect.  Another very likely possibility is that
only a few people submitted the pre-test questionnaire and the same few turned
in the post-test questionnaire.  If these were the only people participating in
the research, then it is possible that the information system positively
affected the level of community in that smaller subgroup of the department.
This is interesting, but we also know that this can be done even without a
computer mediary.  It is important to discover not just whether the level of
community had been raised, but also what people thought were the causal factors
contributing to its increase.

The third possibility is that more people were using the system but the level
of community did not change appreciably.  This is an interesting case because
the fact that many people were using the system indicates they have more
knowledge about the department, yet this has not led to an increased sense of
community.  Since more people were utilizing the system, we know that
advertising was not a problem.  If most users were only passively using the
system, i.e. did not make home pages, add their pictures or list their personal
interests, then it may be that the level of community did not change due to a
lack of active participation.  This outcome does not reveal to us whether the
task of raising the level of community in an organization lends itself to a
computer-based solution.

The last possibility is that we find more people using the system and an
increased sense of community among members of the department.  If it is
possible to determine that the change in community was a direct result of usage
of the information system, then more investigation is in order.  What measures
of community changed and what factors contributed to these changes?  A more
controlled experiment would be necessary to determine these answers.  The
content of the database and its features represent a minimum of what is
necessary to increase a sense of community among department members.
