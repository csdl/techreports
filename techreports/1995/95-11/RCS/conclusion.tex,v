further research.

\section{What We Observed}
Our goal was to investigate how a computer-based information system affects the
sense of community in an organization.  We defined community through a set of
measures.  Based on these measures, we designed and implemented features on our
Web information system which we thought would support community building.
However, where our definition of community has to do with feeling a sense of
importance and belonging, there was little we believed we could do through a
computer.  On the other hand, we believed a computer-based system could have a
very positive effect on the collective self-awareness of an organization.  We
hypothesized that if we provided a way for people to learn more about their
organization, they would feel more of a sense of community.

The results showed that among the faculty and staff, they already felt
important and that they belonged in this organization prior to the introduction
of the computer-based information system.  They also had a good sense of
self-awareness of the department.  Results of the post-test questionnaires
showed these characteristics still held true.  On the other hand, the graduate
and undergraduate students initially did not feel important but did feel a
sense of belonging.  They were largely unable to identify people and projects
in the department.  At the end of the study, they neither felt important nor a
sense of belonging.  However, their sense of self-awareness of the organization
appeared to increase.

This study cannot definitively say that our computer-based mechanisms affected
the sense of community within the ICS department.  However, our results do
support several interesting conjectures.

Members of the ICS community are status conscious.  They view themselves in
terms of their relative positions in the department.  Every effort was made to
keep the questionnaires anonymous to encourage honest opinions on the sense of
community in the department.  However, people repeatedly identified themselves
in the questionnaire: ``I am a part-time lecturer,'' ``..I am the only
secretary,'' ``As the systems administrator,'' ``Being a grad student,'' ``I'm
just an undergraduate.''  There is nothing wrong with recognizing one's
position.  These are all true statements.  It does, however, promote a division
in a community based on the idea of ``us'' and ``them.''  This division became
more prominent in the post-test responses.

We learned that not all students are created equal.  Perhaps the questionnaires
should have been addressed to graduate and undergraduate students separately.
In the pre-test questionnaire, there was only one comment indicating any
intra-student factions, ``..need more undergrad-grad interaction.  Undergrads
should be allowed to participate in research.''  However, there were numerous
comments of this type in the post-test responses.  A few were mentioned in
Chapter \ref{chap:results}.  Here are 2 more:

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
  ``As an undergrad, I think that we'd feel a lot more welcome if we had a
  computer lab.  I mean, engineering undergrads have a lab which they don't have
  to share.  So do people in business.  Why do ICS undergrads have to wait in
  line for computers being monopolized by non-ICS students playing solitaire?
  Grad Students don't have to...''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
  ``There should be more opportunities for students to join in research or
  projects going on with the department.  For undergrads, there is no lab (like
  the graduate lab).''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

Community among the students seemed to have polarized since the introduction of
our Web information system.  The pre-test responses indicate that, overall,
students did not feel important.  They did however, feel like they belonged in
the ICS department.  Their collective self-awareness was very low.  Although
they frequently mentioned their status as a graduate or undergraduate student,
their comments did not reveal any hostility between the two groups.  By the
time the post-test questionnaire was administered, their sense of community
seemed to worsen.  They still felt no sense of importance in the department.
They seemed divided on their sense of belonging.  Half felt it and half did not.
There were few comments saying community was strong in their group, but these
came from graduate students.  The responses by some undergraduates as mentioned
in previous quotes took on a more bitter tone.

These comments reveal that the self-perceived community of the undergraduates
is nonexistent.  But according to our measures, this is not entirely true.  The
questionnaires tested their knowledge of self-awareness and they came out well.
Our server logs shows numerous occasions of accesses of other people's home
pages and other projects or course related information.  While very few
admitted that our Web information system affected their sense of community, our
data shows that it has at least increased self-awareness of the organization
among the students.

If they really were more self-aware, and our definition claims this contributes
to community, why did these students not perceive it this way?  Why did they
not express their sense of community in the department as having improved?
This goes against the idea that if people know more about themselves and their
organization, they will feel more of a sense of community.  Perhaps public
disclosure of all information can do the opposite, that is, decrease the sense
of community.

This decrease in the sense of community can be seen in the undergraduates'
responses.  There were several uses of the derogatory adjective ``peon'' to
refer to themselves.  This occurred only in the post-test questionnaire
responses.  There were numerous references to the graduate students as having a
lab, workstation access, and so forth, while the undergraduates do not.  Not
having the proper resources decreases their sense of importance and relegates
them to a ``peon'' status.  Many undergraduate students indicated they ``only''
took classes and did not do much else.  Upon seeing that the faculty and
graduate students participated actively in research, the undergraduates felt
further alienation.

The graduate students' appeared to perceive themselves as having a strong sense
of community as we saw in many of their comments.  Nearly all of them
participated in the creation of home pages whereas less than half of the
undergraduates did.  There are, of course, visible differences between the two
groups that could attribute to the cohesiveness of one group over the other.
First, graduate students are more mature.  They are likely to deal with the
inequity of resources in a different manner.  Also, there is an order of
magnitude less people in this group.  It is far easier to bring together 40
people over 240.  Lastly, having a meeting place such as the lab, offers more
opportunity for members of this group to bond.

In any case, it appears that increasing self-awareness in an organization has
the potential to increase its sense of community.  It is possible this did not
occur with the undergraduates because the information seemed to flow in one
direction.  They learned more about the projects and issues concerning the
department but had no means for affecting it or being involved.  Whereas they
were once content with their current state as students, upon learning what more
goes on in the department, they felt left out of an aspect of the department in
which they would like to participate.  This often prompts motivation in people.
However, with the undergraduates, any motivation they may have had was met with
frustrating bouts with poor resources, which had little chance of changing
immediately.  This can be an added frustration since the changes they desire
are often slow to take place.  However, undergraduates simply do not have a lot
of time.  They are the transient members of the department.  Also, unlike
graduate students, they have coursework outside of the department and cannot
dedicate all of their time to this cause.

There seemed to be some sense of community within the part of the faculty \&
staff that responded to our questionnaire.  Their personal comments regarding
``divisiveness'' and ``alternate realities'' indicated otherwise.  However,
they sized up well according to our measures.  The faculty and staff felt a
sense of importance and belonging and were very self-aware in both the pre-test
and post-test.  This however, does not seem to be a result of our Web
information system.  Most of the faculty said they used it although not very
frequently.

The information system we introduced drew out the differences between and
within the subgroups.  Almost half of the faculty did not create home pages.
Although the information system was set up for the department, a side effect is
that by publishing on this system, one can increase one's visibility to the
world.  It would seem that faculty members would welcome this feature as their
research can greatly benefit from it.  This information system exposed which
faculty members wanted to publish information about themselves and which ones
avoided participation.  The same is not true for the graduate and
undergraduates since there is no ``definitive list'' of all students.

It appears that an appropriately designed information system can not only
increase the sense of self-awareness in an organization; it can also serve as a
diagnostic tool for determining what specific factors promote or inhibit
community development.  It draws out the visible differences between members to
reveal issues important to them.  For all the good that such a system can do,
we also recognize that the creation of such a virtual community is not all that
is necessary to eliminate barriers to community in the physical environment.

\section{Contributions of this Research}
The results of this research offers many insights into the strengths and
weaknesses of computer based mechanisms to improving the sense of community in
an organization.  One contribution is that this research showed how inequities
between department members inhibited community development.  This was clear
between the undergraduate and graduate students.  Graduate students received
support from the department in the form of computing facilities whereas the
undergraduates did not.  This did more than prevent community development.  In
fact, it further divided the community.

Another contribution concerns the collective self-awareness of a group.  We saw
that public disclosure of information increased communication in one direction.
This can be detrimental to an organization if the information continues to flow
one way.  There also needs to be a way for the receivers of this information to
become involved.  However, we showed that the collective self-awareness of a
group can be improved through computer mediation.  

The design of our information is another contribution.  While this system
design did not improve the overall sense of community in the department, people
found it useful and quickly adopted it.  The study lasted only 4 months but
people quickly began using the system in the first month with relatively little
training.  

The fourth contribution this research has made is that it has defined another
purpose for the World Wide Web.  It is no longer just a universal network of
information; it now also contributes to community building.

Our final contribution is that our Web information system also served as a
diagnostic tool for factors promoting or inhibiting community development.  The
system draws out the visible differences between department members to reveal
new issues important to the group.

\section{Directions for Future Research}
This case study was not meant to prove that the sense of community can be
improved through computer based mechanisms.  We wished to explore the strengths
and weaknesses of this approach as well as how it would affect an organization.
We had the unintended result of polarizing a community.  However, we learned
that the collective self-awareness of an organization can be affected through
these means.  A  direction for future research is to investigate how our system
design can be improved by also incorporating two-way communication.  Is better
communication the only response to prevent polarization of a community who
knows too much about each other?  Perhaps there are other factors?  Again, the
system can serve as a diagnostic tool in determining these factors.

Another direction for future research is to investigate how users access
information from a Web database designed for their organization.  We touched
lightly on this subject in our study.  We looked at a small subset of users and
discovered some patterns of access.  A more controlled experiment could be
performed on a cross-section of the group to learn about how they access
organizational information.  We can discover items of relative importance and
learn what design features can be tailored to the needs of its users.

Finally, we could study the architecture of a Web information system.  This
database is unique in that its architecture rapidly changes through the
publication efforts of its users.  Is it even possible to model such a dynamic
entity?  How does the database evolve over time?  How does a change in
membership or organizational goals affect its architecture?  Is the information
cohesive such that document links point to other documents within the same
domain?  

These are just a few possibilities for future research regarding the World Wide
Web.  The field is quickly evolving and more research is being done on its
social aspects as well as the technical ones.  It is important enough that the
National Science Foundation has organized its research priorities for the
Web.\footnote{See http://www.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/nsf-ws/report/Report.html} Some
of these priorities involve using the Web as a collaborative tool, studying its
architecture and performance, evaluating its usability and so forth.  In fact,
one such recommendation falls in line with our current research.  They are
interested in a study of an application which makes extensive use of the Web.
The entire process is to be carefully studied for its usability issues, its
design history, and the social and organizational changes which come about as a
result of the experiment.  We have only lightly touched on this area where we
investigated using the Web as a tool for building community.  We look forward
to continuing our research and perhaps learn more insights on different uses of
the Web.

importance and belonging, there was little we could do through a computer.
They key word here is ``feeling''.  A person feels important through his own
actions.  Other people and other things may contribute to this feeling, but
feeling important is something that comes from within one's self.  This also
applies when concerning feelings of belonging.  So we were left with the part
of our definition concerning a person's sense of self-awareness of the people
and projects in their organization.  This was an area we felt we could impact
greatly, considering we were using an information system, whose main purpose is
to inform and increase awareness.  So we thought that if we provided a way for
people to learn more about their organization, they will feel more of a sense
of community.

%Others felt the absence of community because of poor computing resources

%They have no lab, as do the graduate students.  They must compete for resources
%with other non-ICS majors.  This is extremely difficult as ICS majors spend
%much more time on the computer than do most other students.  One student
%commented on his lack of support in learning new technologies citing the ``You

%Perhaps this is largely due to the fact that students pay to go to school
%whereas faculty and staff members are paid to be in school.  

%student post-test
%They liked that the Web has opened up another avenue of communication.   They
%had a safe way to express their individuality and 
%learn about others in the process.  Graduate students seemed more close-knit as
%they spent much time together in the lab working and discussing their
%respective projects.  Undergraduate students said they felt alienated through
%their lack of a meeting place, poor computing resources and less encouragement
%to actively pursue a serious project for their degree plan.

%We assumed there to be an initial state of few people being aware of the Web
%and a low level of community.  A resultant state of few users and low level of
