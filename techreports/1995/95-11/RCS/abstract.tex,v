\abstract{

This thesis presents a case study designed to assess the strengths and
weaknesses of a computer-based approach to improving the sense of community
within one organization, the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at
the University of Hawaii.  The case study used a pretest-posttest design.
First, several measures of the sense of community within the department were
obtained via a questionnaire.  Second, a World Wide Web information system was
introduced in an effort to affect the level of community within the department.
Third, a similar questionnaire was administered after a period of four months.
Analysis of the survey responses and system logs showed that the information
system designed to promote community in this organization had instead polarized
it.  We also show how these systems can serve as a diagnostic tool for
discovering what factors may help promote or inhibit community building.
