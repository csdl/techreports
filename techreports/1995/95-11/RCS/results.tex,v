\chapter{Results of the Case Study}
\label{chap:results}

%\subsection{Data analysis}
% What are the range of outcomes from this research?  What is the
% significance of each outcome?

% What data will be collected?  What are example instances of this data?  How
% will the data be analyzed?  How will I know how well I've addressed it?

This chapter reviews results of the case study so that we can investigate how
the Web server might have influenced changes in community.  Data was collected
in two ways.  The first way was through the responses we received from the pre-
and post-test questionnaires.  The second way was by collecting data directly
from the Web server using its log of all requests made.  The next chapter
discusses the implications of these results.

% How will questionnaire data be analyzed?  What constitutes success?  Will
% any data from server statistics be collected/used/how?

\section{Overview of Questionnaire Responses}
This section assesses the change in level of community in the department by
comparing the results of the pre-test and post-test questionnaires.  We first
discuss how each questionnaire is structured and what the various responses
indicate about the sense of community.  Slightly different versions of the
questionnaire were given to two groups, the faculty \& staff and the students.
They only differ in two questions which ask how well the respondents know
people from their department.  These two questions are meant to gather
information about inter-group relationships.  That is, in the questionnaire
given to the faculty \& staff, they are asked how well they know members of the
other group, the students.  Similarly, the questionnaire given to the students
asked how well they know members of the faculty \& staff.  This difference in
the questionnaires came about because people are inclined to be more familiar
with people they work with on a regular basis and we want to analyze
cross-group interactions as they pertain to community.  We will now discuss the
results for each group in turn.

\subsection{Questionnaire Structure}
The pre-test (see Appendix \ref{sec:pre-test}) and post-test questionnaires
(see Appendix \ref{sec:post-test}) for each group differ in that the post-test
questionnaire has seven questions regarding the World Wide Web that replace the
single question on the WWW in the pre-test version.  The pre-test questionnaire
was administered to assess the pre-existing, or baseline sense of community.
The post-test questionnaire was administered to see how the various elements of
community had changed in the department over the course of a semester with the
introduction of our system.  The questionnaire is structured as follows:

\ls{1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Questions 1, 2 and 3 request numeric answers.  The first question
  determines which group the respondent works with the most.  The second and
  third questions establish how many members of the department the respondent
  knows personally and how many they could identify by face.  Answers to
  these questions tell us how many other members of the department people are
  familiar with or know on a personal basis.}
%It also tells us how far-reaching community is for a single person.
\item{Questions 5 and 6 address the respondent's sense of significance and
  solidarity in the department.}
\item{Questions 4, 7 and 8 are fact-finding questions.  They have right and
  wrong answers.  These responses tell us how self-aware the respondents are
  of people in their own organization.  They show us if people know how many
  members there are in the department as well as who the resident experts are
  and what different projects are being conducted by various people.}
\item{Question 9 informs us on how different people like to communicate with
  each other.}
\item{Question 10 assesses how many people needed to be introduced
  to the software needed for Web browsing.}
\item{Question 11 is open-ended to provide us feedback on what people think
  about the sense of community within the department.}
\end{itemize}
\ls{1.5}

In addition to these 11 questions, the post-test questionnaire asked seven
other questions, most of which relate to the World Wide Web.  They replace question
10 as mentioned above.  The purpose and structure of these questions follow:

\ls{1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Question 10 asks how people discovered the ICS Web site, if at all.  This
  is important in determining if a lack of advertising inhibited usage of the
  information system.}
\item{Question 11 is useful for determining whether a new user had adequate
  resources to get training in using the Web information system.}
\item{Questions 12-15 relate to what extent people were using the system, how
  comfortable they were with it, whether they found it useful and why they
  bothered to use it at all.}
\item{Question 16 was asked to see if the respondents had filled out the
  Pre-Test questionnaire as well.}
\end{itemize}
\ls{1.5}

\subsection{The Faculty \& Staff}

Table \ref{tab:numResponses} shows we received 10 pre-test responses out of 21
from the faculty and staff.  However, we received only 7 post-test responses
from them.  There are 19 faculty and 3 staff members.  With such few responses,
it is difficult to tell how representative this data is of the whole group.

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{Number of Questionnaire Responses}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}\hline
  & {\bf Pre-Test} & {\bf Post-Test} & {\bf Max Possible} \\ \hline 
  {\bf Faculty/Staff} & 10 & 7 & 21 \\ \hline 
  {\bf Students} & 43 & 84 & 278 \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:numResponses}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Questions 1, 2 and 3}

Question 1 in Table \ref{tab:question1a} shows that these respondents appear
to mix well with other subgroups in the department, as there were responses for
every subgroup, (i.e. faculty, staff, graduate students and undergraduate
students) in the pre-test and nearly all subgroups in the post-test.

\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{Administration: Question 1 results}
\begin{center}
{Which group do you work with most?}\\[1ex]
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
% \multicolumn{3}{l}{\rule[-5mm]{0mm}{10mm}\bf Which group do you work with
% most?}\\ \hline 
 \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Group} & 
 \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Pre-Test} &
 \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{\bf Post-Test} \\ \hline

 Undergraduate students & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{1} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{1} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:question1a}
\end{table}

Since it is more likely for faculty and staff to know people in their own
subgroups, we asked if they knew people from a different subgroup, students.
The pre-test results for questions 2 and 3 in Tables \ref{tab:question2a} and
\ref{tab:question3a} shows that few faculty and staff members initially knew many
of the students while most knew only a handful.  Most of them felt they could
identify less than 20 of their students.  In the post-test, they collectively
seemed to improve in getting to know their students personally and being able
to identify them by face.  We can infer they improved in this area since all
but one of the respondents indicated they filled out the pre-test questionnaire
also (see Table \ref{tab:question16a}).

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:question3a}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Questions 5 and 6}

Question 5 (Table \ref{tab:question5a}) asked if people felt they played an
important role in the department.  Nine responded affirmatively and there was
one with no response.  Their positive responses were based on their positions
in the department.  They each had a job which they felt was important.  The
post-test shows the same sentiment as six members felt they played an important
role and one gave an unclear answer.  Two of them felt important through their
teaching and research.  One felt ``not any more significant than any other
faculty member'', which equates to a ``yes'' since the faculty generally tended
to feel a sense of significance in the department.  The last respondent felt
less important in that he ``just'' handled classes.  But he felt some
importance in that he had some leeway in determining the class content.

\ls{1}
\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{Administration: Question 5 results}

  or why not?}

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:question5a}
\end{table}
\ls{1.5}

%!!! double-check numbers
In question 6 (see Table \ref{tab:question6a}), we asked if people felt a sense
of belonging in the department.  As with the previous question, nine said they
did while one only felt ``so-so''.  Their sense of belonging seemed to be less
related to their jobs.  Some felt they belonged just because they had a
``position'' in the department.  One felt that he or she belonged because of
participation in departmental affairs while the person that responded ``so-so''
said that the department ``does not do much at all anyway.''  Yet another
person felt belonging through ``longevity, if nothing else.''  In the
post-test, all seven people said they felt a sense of belonging.  One response
was that the person felt that he ``belonged here more than anywhere else''.

\end{center}
\label{tab:question4a}
\end{table}
\ls{1.5}

Question 4 (Table \ref{tab:question4a}) asked respondents to give numeric
estimates of how many faculty, graduate and undergraduate students they think
are in the department.  The faculty and staff did well in the pre-test
identifying within a reasonable range the size of each subgroup.  In the
post-test, they did not do as well, where half guessed incorrectly on the
faculty and all guessed too low on the undergraduates.

Responses to question 7 (Table \ref{tab:question7a}) show that about half of
the respondents could name the prominent research groups such as CSDL, SERL and
PACCOM and some of the individual research projects going on in the department.
They mostly listed projects of their colleagues' and only one person mentioned
this graduate student's work.  The post-test responses yielded the same results
but identified fewer projects.  The research group garnering the most number of
acknowledgements happened to be the one with which I am associated.

The faculty and staff did well in question 8 where 80\% - 90\% of them
correctly identified a resident expert in a particular subject.  The two
exceptions are that they did not identify a games expert or an employment
opportunities expert.  As in the pre-test questionnaire, the post-test results
were also accurate except for identifying the games expert and the employment
opportunities expert.  In Table \ref{tab:question8a}, an expert is listed
followed by the count of ``votes'' he or she received.  The row ``Others''
refers to the total count of votes for other people who garnered just two or
less votes.

\subsubsection{Questions 9 and 10}

Question 9 (see Table \ref{tab:question9a}) shows us how these respondents
prefer to communicate.  Most people are daily users of email and telephone.
Informal meetings ran the gamut from daily use to never doing it at all.
Formal meetings were either done monthly or rarely to never.  The results are
the same in the post-test which shows again that most people are daily users of
email and the telephone.  Informal meetings take place with varying frequencies
and formal meetings are held mostly monthly.

\ls{1}

respondents already used the World Wide Web while 3 did not.

\subsubsection{Post-Test Questions 10-16}

In questions 10-15 (see Tables
\ref{tab:Postquestion10a}-\ref{tab:question15a}), it seems that all seven
people knew of the ICS Web site, while two of them had no knowledge of training
sessions offered throughout the semester.  Most used it with relatively low
frequency.  Five of them felt competent in accessing information on the Web and
three felt they could publish information on it.  Five people felt that the ICS
departmental information was useful.  One comment was that it was not kept up
to date.  Others thought it was good to know ``who's who in the department and
what they do.''  These people found the Web to be fun and exciting and an easy
way to navigate the Internet.

\subsubsection{Question 17}

The last question asked people to comment on the sense of community in the
department.  There were only 3 in the pre-test, none of which were very
optimistic.  

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``Given the message traffic, I sense a very low morale within the
department.  Since I only lecture and do not work on site, I have not
personally observed this condition.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``There doesn't seem to be any.  Probably due to the varying research interests
and an apparent lack of goal and direction for the department.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``It's more of a sense of communities - alternate realities.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

Here is the only comment from the post-test:

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``Faculty: somewhat divisive\\
Chinese students: a strong community\\
Grad students who use K304: a strong sense of community\\
Undergrads: There are community pockets!''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\subsubsection{Summary}

%summing up - pre
In summary, the pre-test results for the faculty and staff showed:

\ls{1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Most worked with other faculty members.}
\item{Most knew less than 10 students personally and could identify less than
20 of them by face.}
\item{They accurately estimated the number of faculty but not the students.}
\item{They felt a sense of significance and belonging in the department.}
\item{They were able to accurately identify research projects and subject experts.}
\end{itemize}
\ls{1.5}

From the pre-test responses, the faculty and staff seem to be a group that
knows each other well if not all of the students.  For the most part, they all
felt a sense of significance and solidarity in this community.  However, there
were a few responses that seem to indicate some lack of a common goal or
direction.

%summing up - post
Here are the results from the post-test:

\ls{1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Most worked with other faculty members.}
\item{Most knew less than 20 students personally and could identify them by
face.}
\item{They only accurately estimated the size of graduate students.}
\item{They felt a sense of significance and belonging in the department.}
\item{They were able to accurately identify research projects and subject
experts.}
\item{Most knew of the ICS Web site and found it useful.}
\item{They accessed the ICS Web site with low frequency.}
\end{itemize}
\ls{1.5}

With such few responses, it is impossible to speculate on any changes within
the faculty.  Although they could not identify the sizes of each subgroup, they
were aware of the various projects and resident experts on different subjects.
They seemed to have a strong sense of importance and belonging.  All but two
felt they were competent users of the Web.  To what extent can we attribute any
community building to the introduction of our ICS information system on the
Web?  It is unlikely that our ICS Web site greatly affected their sense of
community since they did not use it with great frequency.  On a brighter side,
they did use the system to both get and give information and noted its
usefulness.

\subsection{The Students}

We received 43 pre-test responses and 84 post-test responses out of a possible
278 from graduate and undergraduate students (see Table
\ref{tab:numResponses}).  There are approximately 38 graduate students and 240
undergraduates.

\subsubsection{Questions 1, 2 and 3}

When asked which group they work with the most (Table \ref{tab:question1s}),
about 70\% said they worked most with undergraduates while 26\% said they
worked most with graduate students.  Only 3 people said they worked most with
the faculty.  The post-test yielded the same results where 73\% said they
worked most with undergraduates while 20\% said they worked most with graduate
students.  Only 1\% worked most with the faculty and 6\% worked most with the
staff.

\begin{table}[htb]

 Undergraduate students & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{30} & \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{61} \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:question1s}
\end{table}

In question 2 (Table \ref{tab:question2s}), we asked how many faculty members
the students knew personally and drew a near unanimous ``less than 10'' in the
pre-test.  In the post-test, 85\% knew less than 5, 14\% knew less than 10 and
1\% knew less than 15.  Note the different scaling in the pre-test and
post-test questionnaires.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:question2s}
\end{table}

In question 3 (Table \ref{tab:question3s}), most students felt they could
identify less than 10 ICS faculty members by face.  About 16\% felt they could
name less than 20 ICS faculty.  Strangely, one person said they could do it for
over 30 ICS faculty.  This is an impossible feat since there are only 18 ICS
faculty members.  The post-test results show that 45\% could identify less than
a handful of the faculty while 40\% felt they could identify less than 10 of
them.  The scaling was a little different in the pre-test questionnaire.  But
there was some improvement in that now 12\% can identify less than 15 faculty
members.

\end{table}
\ls{1.5}

\subsubsection{Questions 5 and 6}

Question 5 (Table \ref{tab:question5s}) asked if people felt they played an
important role in the department.  About 14\% responded ``yes'' while an
overwhelming 81\% said ``no''.  As with the faculty and staff, those that
responded positively related their response to their job in the department as
being a teaching assistant or lab monitor.  These respondents seemed to think
that being paid to do something affirms one's importance.  Others felt less
important because they were not active in ICS related projects.  Some felt
unimportant because of a lack of communication between faculty, staff and
students.  One person commented on his unimportance being related to a lack of
regard for the course/instructor evaluations.  He felt students were not taken
seriously in this respect.  A large number of responses indicated that they did
not feel they played an important role because they were ``just'' students who
only attended classes while a few said they were important for the very reason
that ``students are the most important part in the university.''

\ls{1}
\begin{table}[htb]
\caption{Students: Question 5 results}
{Do you feel you play a significant role in the ICS department?  Why
  or why not?} 
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
% \multicolumn{3}{l}{\rule[-5mm]{0mm}{10mm}\bf Do you feel you play a
% significant role in the ICS department?}\\ \hline
  & {\bf Pre-Test} & {\bf Post-Test} \\ \hline 
 Yes & 6 & 12 \\ \hline 
 No & 35 & 60 \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:question5s}
\end{table}
\ls{1.5}

The post-test results of question 5 were the same as in the pre-test.
Approximately 14\% responded that they felt they played a significant role in
the department while 71\% felt they did not.  Somehow students felt important
if there was some tangible measure of that importance.  For example, the TAs
and monitors again were some of the few that felt important because of their
positions.  Others felt they were important because they were working with some
professor on a specific project.  But there were still those few that did not
need anything tangible and felt they were important just because they are
students representing the department.  The naysayers felt less important for
many of the same reasons as before.  They were just ``peon'' students who only
took classes and did little else to further the department.  The lack of
communication between the faculty and students also prevented students from
feeling like they were important enough to be kept informed.  Just as they did
not feel they were receiving information from the faculty, the students neither
felt they had any means of expressing their views to them.  They had ``no real
venue to express opinions about policy...''.  They also felt their course
evaluations were ignored as some professors continued in the same teaching
style found to be difficult for some.

Perhaps the biggest complaint was a feeling of unworthiness among the
undergraduate students.  They felt doubly alienated in the fact that they do
not have a dedicated lab for computing resources and rarely participate in
important research projects.  But it seems that as this experiment with the Web
information system wore on, students learned there was a whole lot of
interesting work being done in the department, none of which they were a part
of.  As one student puts it, ``no one really encourages undergrads to pursue
projects as much as they do the graduate students.  And I think that this
attitude is the main reason why most undergrad students feel as if they're `in
the way' in the ICS department and that they're not enthusiastic about becoming
a graduate student at UH.''

\ls{1}
\begin{table}[htb]

 Yes & 24 & 37 \\ \hline 
 No & 16 & 38 \\ \hline 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{tab:question6s}
\end{table}
\ls{1.5}

In question 6 (Table \ref{tab:question6s}), we asked if people felt a sense of
belonging in the department.  In the pre-test, 56\% said ``yes'', 37\% said
``no'' and 2\% said ``so-so''.  Those who felt they belonged did so because
they were acquainted with some faculty members and many other students.
Sharing many of the same classes fostered this sense of belonging for them.
Spending a lot of time in the building that houses the department also seemed
to foster some belonging.  Some even said they belonged here in the ICS
department more than anywhere else on campus.  Those that did not feel they
belonged said so because they had little involvement in the department or that
the department did not hold any outside activities such as seminars or
workshops.

The post-test results were split down the middle where 44\% felt they belonged
and 45\% did not feel belonging in the department.  The sentiment of those who
said yes was summed up well by one student, ``All of us are like some kind of
extended family.  We all see each other before, during, and after class almost
every school day.  We spend so much time in the labs that sometimes I actually
expect the others to be there when I'm there.''  Others felt that the people
were generally friendly and helpful, making them feel a sense of belonging.
Those who said ``no'' felt that way because they either hardly spent time in
school activities or just kept to themselves, going to classes and leaving once
they were done.  Many did not like the fact that we once had an ICS club which
is no longer active.

\subsubsection{Questions 4, 7, and 8}

When asked to give numeric estimates of how many faculty, graduate and
undergraduate students they think are in the department (Table
\ref{tab:question4s}), we got a wide range of answers with relatively equal
amounts in each range, indicating most did not know the answer and were
probably just guessing.  The post-test results yielded the same results.  The
estimate of undergraduate students ran mainly under 100, which is just about
how many are listed under our Web site.

Responses to question 7 (Table \ref{tab:question7s}) were very dismal.  A
large percentage (74\%) did not even attempt to answer this question.  About
14\% made feeble attempts at answers meaning they listed only 1 or 2 projects.
The few that were listed were mostly correct.  The last 2 projects listed did
not exist.  The post-test responses to question 7 were very encouraging.  This
time, only 13\% did not attempt to answer this question and 14\% made feeble
attempts.  The rest gave a good try and were successful in naming the different
research groups.  They were also able to list individual projects by many of
the professors.  The top four vote-getters were all associated with this
author's research group.

\ls{1.5}

The students did not fare well in question 8 (Table \ref{tab:question8s}) where
28\% made no attempt to answer the question and 30\% made feeble attempts at
answers.  For those that did respond, they could only identify the resident
expert in half the categories.  The other half had a range of responses where
nearly every faculty member was listed at least once.  It is clear that most
students did not know who was the expert in what field.  The post-test yielded
some interesting insights.  About 10\% made no attempt to answer the question
and 8\% made feeble attempts at answers.  They did a little better this time
since a larger percentage accurately named the resident expert in nearly all of
the categories.  For the expert in departmental rules, students generally
listed the undergraduate and graduate advisors.  Obviously, this is who they
turn to for advice whereas the faculty named the chairman, their boss, as the
expert in this category.  The category of computer network expert also yielded
interesting answers.  Students listed the last 2 professors who taught that
course.  Only one student listed the person which the faculty felt was the
network expert.  Since that particular faculty member rarely teaches, most
students do not know him nor what he does.  Unlike the professors, students
knew of the computer games expert.  As with the department rules, students
listed their advisors for knowledge in employment opportunities.

In question 9 (Table \ref{tab:question9s}), we see that 67\% of students use
email on a daily basis and 42\% also use the telephone daily.  Almost no one
uses a fax machine or holds formal meetings to communicate.  Informal meetings
are held with varying frequencies.  The post-test shows the same results where
73\% of students use email on a daily basis and 46\% also use the telephone
daily.  Informal meetings are held with varying frequencies, but mostly on a
weekly basis.

The following pertains to questions 10-15 (Tables \ref{tab:Postquestion10s} -
\ref{tab:question15s}).  Only 4 people (5\%) of the respondents said they did
not know the department had a Web site.  Most found out either through email, a
friend or their professor.  About 57\% found the training sessions useful and
20\% thought they were frequently and flexibly scheduled while 14\% did not
bother to attend them.  Most of the students use the ICS Department's web site
between a few times a month to a few times a week.  69\% felt they were
competent Web surfers but only 19\% were confident in Web publishing.  However,
27\% felt that they were not competent in using the World Wide Web.  The main
reason students (67\%) are using the Web is that it is fun and exciting.  Other
reasons were that it makes navigation of the Internet simple (49\%) and that it
was required by their professor(42\%).  Only 5\% still did not use the Web.

When asked whether the Web information presented on the department was useful
(Table \ref{tab:question14s}), 17\% thought that is was and 2\% did not.  The
rest made no comment.  One thought it was entertaining and one thought it was
``so-so.''  Most students found it useful in getting course information,
assignments and lecture notes.  The rest liked that it helped them learn more
about other people in the department.  One commented, ``It was interesting to
see the interests of others through their home pages.  I think it would be
better if ALL people in the department were on the page.''  Another said ``I
liked the fact that everyone has a home page and most with their picture on it.
That way I can put a name with a face and their work and interests.''

About 33\% of the students said they had completed the pre-test questionnaire
and 61\% said they did not (see Table \ref{tab:question16s}).

\subsubsection{Question 17}

The last question asked people to comment on the sense of community in the
department.  Here are some of those comments:

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
  ``It's there, but it needs to be brought out - some type of club or other
  activities.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
  ``Since I do almost all my work on my home computer, I don't know how accurate
  this statement is, but from my personal point of view, I can walk through the
  labs, classes, etc and maybe recognize 7 people total, and know the names of
  3-4 of them.  Also, although I do talk to friends in the department, I could
  walk past most of them without even knowing it, since I have never seen them
  before.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
  ``I feel that equipment in the department are pretty out-of-date.  Slow
  computers, old junky software, lack of computers and software,...  These are
  the facts of our ICS Dept.  The workstation is always crowded with people.  The
  UHUNIX system is disappointingly difficult to access through modems until
  1am.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``The ICS dept is obviously lacking in communication with other CS students.
If Rose did not come here today, we definitely don't know if ICS dept has any
activities.  This is very important since if there is no announcement, then
students will have no interest at all for this major...Finally, where is the ICS
club?''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
  ``There is no list of other people in the ICS major.  No information about
  anything concerning ICS.  To me there is no sense of community in the ICS
  dept.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
  ``I feel a sense of belonging in the ICS dept.  But also sense very high
  competition among students.  Being a grad student I sometimes see a lack of
  willingness of people to work together.  I was always encouraged to work in
  groups.  I also noticed ethnic divisions in the ICS grad department and see
  some resentment with some students.  I have also heard from some that certain
  students get TAs in the lower division courses.  Some upper division TAs go to
  mainly foreign students.  If this is true, it's not very fair.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

We had many different post-test comments on the sense of community in the
department.  Some are listed below:

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``I think that the ICS Web Site has been the closest to a community that we've
had among the undergrads.  We really don't have the inter-department
association found in other majors ( ex. business ) through social activities
(ex. dances, picnics ).  Of course, this could be because we're all geeks and
don't go to those things, anyway.  This is why the Web is the best means of
bringing the department together.  We all can learn about about each other in a
safe environment.  The Web allows us to face the world as we see ourselves.
For example, [name withheld] wishes the community to view him as a crazy, nutty
guy, and has consistently portrayed himself as such in his Web page.  I do
believe that our Web pages are a reflection of our own self-images, and as
such, they allow others to get to know us without even meeting us.  This may
seem cold and impersonal, but it seems to be the best way to meet neighbors who
we may never cross paths with.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``There's far too little Americans in the classes.  The other nationalities
often take over the classes and the labs.  I feel that the ICS department
should be doing something to recruit more American students into the program,
instead of scaring them off in the beginning levels.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``It would be nice if there is a common room for everyone in our department to
sit down, talk, and relax.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``Undergrads don't have a place in the `community', and because of that it may
cause students to lose interest in cs, and/or not perform as well in class.
Also there is no opportunity to apply theories that we learn in class, other
than assignments because we don't have the chance to go to the ``graduate'' lab
or even know about the research projects going on in the department.  I think
that if a professor is working on some research, or on a project, he/she should
enhance his/her class with exposure to the kinds of research/projects, perhaps
give incentive to students who are willing to participate and integrate
classroom experience with some practical applications.  Basically the
professors do not have much enthusiasm and motivation in teaching.  If they do
have any enthusiasm or motivation much of it in my guess is in their research,
holed up in their offices/labs, and only the biggies knowing about it....of
course they have to worry about tenure and being published and writing papers
for consortiums/conferences all over the world, doing some kind of
world-reknown research with huge grants--matters more important to them than
being concerned about the quality of teaching peons like us.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``I think it has improved at least among some of us graduate students.  I'm not
sure how much the WWW had to do with this.  The biggest gain was going out
drinking on Thursdays.''
\end{quote}
\ls{1.5}

\ls{1}
\begin{quote}
``I know that much of the motivation should come from the individual (student),
but morale goes down and enthusiasm goes down when the quality of teaching just
isn't there--who wants to go to class, who wants to participate in class, in
that case.  There are lots of good professors here, if only they'd bring it in
to their teaching.''
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
  ``The instructors and TA and grad students seem to be a more tightly-knit
  community.''

\subsubsection{Summary}

%summing up - pre
In summary, the major points identified in the student responses during the
pre-test are:

\ls{1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Most worked with other undergraduate students.}
\item{Most knew less than 10 faculty members personally and could identify
  less than 10 of them by face.}
\item{They had no idea the size of faculty, graduate and undergraduate students.}
\item{They did not feel a sense of significance in the department.}
\item{More than half felt a sense of belonging in the department.}
\item{They did not accurately identify research projects and subject experts.}
\end{itemize}
\ls{1.5}

Unlike the faculty and staff, students were not quite as self-aware of the
people and projects in their department.  They did not know many faculty
members well nor could identify them by face.  They could not cite the size of
each subgroup, the major research projects nor the resident experts.  They
generally did not feel they played a significant role in the department.  The
one bright spot is that more than half did feel a sense of belonging in the
department.  It is not all that is needed in a community, but it is a start.

%summing up - post
Here is a brief summary of the post-test questionnaire results:

\ls{1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Most worked with other undergraduate students.}
\item{Most knew less than 10 faculty members personally and could identify
  less than 10 of them by face.}
\item{They did not know the size of faculty, graduate and undergraduate
  students.}
\item{They did not feel a sense of significance in the department.}
\item{About half felt a sense of belonging in the department.}
\item{They accurately identified research projects and subject experts.}
\item{Most knew of the ICS Web site and some found it useful.}
\item{They accessed the ICS Web site with some frequently.}
\end{itemize}
\ls{1.5}

By the end of the semester, students appeared to increase their sense of
self-awareness in the department.  They may not know many people on a personal
level but were able to identify them by face, and can name their interests,
research projects and their expertise.  Their feelings of importance in the
department were still rather low.  It seemed that the students who had paid
positions felt any sense of significance.  These were typically the graduate
students employed as teaching assistants or lab monitors.  The students' sense
of belonging seemed to be divided.  Those that spent any amount of time on
campus outside of classes were more apt to feel belonging than those who went
to class and participated in little else concerning the department.  Many of
the respondents were competent users of the Web, finding it fun, exciting,
useful and using it with some frequency.  Students seemed to be less in the
dark about departmental projects, activities and events.

\section{Statistics of Database Accesses}
The Web server we are using keeps a log of all incoming requests.  Information
about which documents are being requested, when, how often, etc. is all noted
in a logfile.  Unfortunately, it does not collect data on which specific user
requested a document.  Instead, it only records the machine name from which the
document request was made.

To assess how our Web server affected the level of community in the ICS
department, we investigated how users accessed the system.

\subsection{User Contribution}
Any user may directly contribute to the ICS Web information system.  By
``directly,'' we mean that there is no middle man involved in this
contribution.  Unlike most publications, the data published on the Web site is
not cleared by an editor before everything goes public.  Users are given free
reign regarding this issue.  We were not trying to be overly democratic in
wanting to increase the sense of community here.  This simply happens to be an
outcome of the way the server was designed.

Basically, a Web site can serve documents to requesting clients from either of
two places within the file system.  The first is a distinguished directory
which serves as ``Home Base'' for any Web site.  In a networked file system
which supports multi-user access, such as the one we have in the ICS
department, there is usually only one person in charge of these files.  It may
be the system administrator and/or the webmaster.  This person generally acts
as the editor for all information published at their site.  The other area of
the file system where a Web server may serve documents is in a user's
directory.

All users need to do to publish information is to create a subdirectory with a
specified name and store their related files under that subdirectory hierarchy.
The files must adhere to some formatting conventions and must also be
world-readable.  Just through the creation of a directory and some files, a
user may publish on the World Wide Web.

Given the simplicity in publishing, we worked out three ways for users to
contribute to our Web site.  The first and most popular way is through the
creation of a home page.  It is simply a text file written in HTML.  This
process was facilitated by a unix shell script written by this author.  The
script was a program such that when executed, it would create a personalized
home page for that user.  Instructions on this procedure were also given
online.  Users who liked to learn things on their own were also free to look up
numerous references on the creation of an HTML document.  Having an accessible
home page is only useful if people know its URL, or address.  To simplify
matters for people browsing our system, we automatically created a listing of
all users who have home pages in their directories.  

The second way to contribute to our Web site was by publishing your picture on
the network.  All people had to do was to get a digitized picture of themselves
and to store it under a specific name in the above mentioned subdirectory.  As
with the home pages, another listing of people with pictures was also created
for ease in browsing.  

The last way for users to directly contribute to this Web site was through our
Personal Interests Page.  Users need only modify a line in their home page to
list their hobbies.  Again, we created yet another page, which listed different
hobbies and the home pages of the people associated with those hobbies.

One measure of user participation is the creation of a personal home page.
There are 18 faculty members, 3 staff, approximately 38 Master's students and
240 undergraduates.  Due to a shortage of resources, the department can only
supply unix accounts to the faculty, staff and graduate students.  We also give
accounts to PhD candidates who are part of an interdisciplinary program.  There
are less than 10 of these students.  Undergraduates are accommodated by the
University's computing center.  The ICS Web server is housed on a unix platform
maintained by this department.  Only users with accounts on this network may
publish home pages.  This posed the problem of accommodating the
undergraduates, who make up the vast majority of the department.  To alleviate
this problem, we coordinated with the University's computing center to allow
undergraduates full authorship on the Web.  They are publishing on a different
network, but lists and links to undergraduate pages are still maintained by the
ICS department.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=HomePages.eps}}
\caption{Percentage of home pages created by members of the ICS Department.}
\label{fig:HomePages}
\end{figure}

Analysis of the logfiles for the ICS network reveals user participation of
faculty, staff and graduate students.  When the server was initially installed
in August, we ran a pilot test of the system on our research group of 9 people.
Before the public release in January five months later, some of the faculty and
graduate students somehow caught wind of the Web server and took the initiative
in publishing their own pages without any training.  In fact, a few days before
the first training session, 37\% of the graduate students already had a home
page.  One week after the server was publicly released, 29\% of the faculty \&
staff and 55\% of the graduate students created home pages.  This coincided
with the introductory training sessions that month to an audience of
approximately 140 people.  See Table \ref{tab:chronology} which marks
important dates and events regarding the ICS Department's Web server public
release and training schedule.  In addition to the training, the questionnaire
was administered shortly after the public release.  The author also gave a talk
to a graduate level class on her research.

Unfortunately, since the undergraduates are housed on a different network, we
do not maintain the logfiles for their system.  The administrators of that
system were only able to provide us with logfiles beginning January 22, 1995.
They were also missing data for the week of Feb 5-12.  During these ``missing''
dates, in Figure \ref{fig:HomePages}, we can see a lull in the creation of home
pages for undergraduates.  However, the general trend is that there is a steady
increase in home pages until mid-February when training had slowed down.
Advanced classes were offered, but this did not increase the number of new
users.  As for the graduate students, their increase in activity picked up at
the start of the semester and leveled off starting in February.  There is also
a lull in home page creation during the week of January 22 where we had some
problems with the logfiles.  Data for that week was not recorded.  

By the end of the semester, we got 97\% participation by the graduate students,
38\% participation by the undergraduates and about 62\% from the faculty and
staff.  It seems that the most active users of the system were the graduate
students.  Even though the faculty \& staff was half as large as the graduate
students, only little more than half of them actively participated through the
creation of a home page.  Although the total number of undergraduates who
participated amounted to more than the combined total of graduates and faculty
\& staff, the overall participation of that group was low.

\subsection{Access Patterns}
In order to better design a community-oriented information system, it would
help to know how users actually use the database.  We can study access patterns
of our database by analyzing our logfiles.  Although we do not have an explicit
measure for knowing which user accessed what information, we can gather this
implicitly.  Figure \ref{fig:logitem} shows a sample log entry item.  The four
items noted in a log entry include: the machine name of the requesting client,
the date and time of request, the document request and the return codes.  The
return code 200 indicates a successful request.  Since the logfiles do record
the machine names of requesting clients, we can selectively study accesses from
machines located within our department.  To learn how department members access
information from our Web site, we chose to study logs originating from 10
workstations in the lab, all of which get an average of 12 hours of daily use
primarily by graduate students.  We can heuristically identify different
``sessions'' as request sequences with less than 5 minutes between successive
requests.  It is possible that one user may be physically logged on to a
machine while another is remotely logged on to the same one.  If both users ran
a Web browser and accessed information from our Web site simultaneously, then
the session logs would show their accesses interleaved.  Careful analysis of
the log files can almost always reveal this type of situation.  Access patterns
such as these were ignored.

\caption{A sample logfile entry.}
\label{fig:logitem}
\end{figure}
\ls{1.5}
\normalsize

From this data, we found four main access patterns.  The first pattern concerns
which document from our database a user accessed first in any given session.
We found two main entry points from which users accessed the system.  Many
chose to start at the department's home page or their own personal home page.
The unix shell script used in the training sessions had the additional feature
of configuring a user's system such that it would retrieve the ICS home page
when starting a particular Web browser.  This could account for people
beginning their navigation through our database at that entry point.  URLs can
be very long and appear cryptic.  For this reason, users typically do not
explicitly type them in to retrieve a document.  They can set a ``bookmark'' in
their browser such that clicking on this bookmark retrieves the associated
document.  People often set bookmarks for pages they find interesting or
important enough that they plan to retrieve it again in the future.  It appears
that users are configuring their browsers to start at these entry points or
setting bookmarks for these pages.

The second pattern we discovered concerns the general departmental information
available on the system.  Requests for these documents occurred throughout the
semester.  However, there were substantially less requests for these documents
a month after the system was introduced.  It appears that users will initially
navigate through the system to get a feel for the types of information
available.  This type of information is usually static.  So users would not
need to repeatedly request it.  Changes to these documents would be reflected
in the ``What's new'' page mentioned in Chapter \ref{chap:experiment}.

The third pattern concerns how users navigate through the database.  They often
navigated by going through the hierarchy in which we presented the information.
Users typically started at the ICS home page and traversed a path to a specific
point.  For example, a user may wish to see a fellow student's home page.  Its
URL is very simple to remember since it differs from one's URL by the login
name.  However, the logs often showed users to first consult the ICS home page,
followed by the home page listing, and finally the user's page.  An exception
to this pattern was course-related information.  Many users did go through the
typical path: ICS home page, home page listing, professor's home page, class
home page.  However, there were many sessions showing users directly accessing
their class home page.  Since it is very unlikely they would type the URL for
every access, we can assume they set a bookmark to this page.

The machine name is omitted from the logfile.
\end{center}
\caption{Sample session log of home page perusal.}
\label{fig:loghp}
\end{figure}
\ls{1.5}

Finally, the last pattern we noticed concerned how much time users spent on
particular documents.  Figure \ref{fig:loghp} shows a session where a user
perused several other home pages.  The ``/'' document refers to the ICS home
page.  A document whose pattern begins with ``/$\sim$'' and is followed by a
username refers to Web files for that user.  Requests for graphics were omitted
from this log since they are automatically downloaded on a document request and
do not contribute to navigational data.  Notice that it took this user 12
minutes to peruse 9 home pages by various faculty and students.  In fact, this
user often spent less than a minute on some pages.

This is in stark contrast to how much time a user will spend on his or her own
Web pages.  Why would someone be accessing their own home page?  They will
typically be redesigning it or adding new information to it.  Some will
incorporate advanced HTML features by making their pages interactive.  This
often involves writing programs and testing them.  These sessions are
characterized as a stream of many mini-sessions.  Users often start at their
home page and stop.  Some minutes later, they will access their page again.  It
may or may not return successfully.  The return codes would indicate this one
way or the other.  The session will end and restart again later.  These
debugging and redesigning sessions can last for a few minutes or they sometimes
drag on for hours.  Where accessing our information system is concerned, users
spent much more time designing and tailoring their Web pages than they did in
wandering through the database.  This does not imply they did not read other
information.  Once a user successfully retrieves a document, we have no way of
knowing what they did with it.  They could save it, mail it to someone, or
print it for later use.  What we do know is that they spent much time
repeatedly accessing and refining their own pages.

In summary, users tend to access our information system with the following
patterns:

\ls{1}
\begin{itemize}
\item{They begin navigation through the database at either the ICS home page
  or their own home page.}
\item{They traverse the general information area of the database upon first
  introduction to the system.  These documents get substantially less
  requests thereafer.}
\item{They set bookmarks to areas they found important, such as a class home
  page.  However, they otherwise navigated through the database starting at
  the ICS home page and traversed the system using the hierarchy presented to
  them.}
\item{They labored over the creation of their own Web documents, but spent
  anywhere from seconds to unknown amounts of time reviewing other Web
  pages.}
\end{itemize}
\ls{1.5}

%!!!relate to community
How does this information help us in designing systems that enhance an
organization's sense of community?  Since the first pattern tells us that users
typically start at their home page or the department's home page, it is likely
they will start at the main home page when they need to gather departmental
information.  So this page should be logically organized such that any
departmental information can be accessed quickly and easily.  The third pattern
reinforces this suggestion.  Different users will consider different documents
as important to them.  Instead of attempting to list all such important
documents, we should ensure that information is logically organized and easily
accessible.  

Since users are less likely to repeatedly request general information as
suggested by the second access pattern, there should be some mechanism for
informing users when this data changes.  Our ``What's new'' page is an example
of how this can be accomplished.  The last pattern suggests that users who
modify their home pages probably want their pages viewed again.  Our ``What's
new'' page also included recently modified home pages.  Since users spent much
time on modifying their home page, online support for home page creation and
design might be helpful.  Our information system included online help and was
listed under ``Web Services.''  These patterns offer suggestions that address
the collective self-awareness of an organization.  Fortunately, the design of
our system include features, explained in Chapter \ref{chap:www}, which
directly address this issue.

%Another way people browsed was to retrieve a specific piece of information.
%For example, people often accessed the database to get homework assignments or
%lecture notes.  Figure \ref{fig:loghw} is an excerpt from the logfiles showing
%a student entering at the department's main entry point and traversing to the
%listing of all user home pages to find his professor.  After finding his
%professor's home page, he goes to the class page (ICS 441) and retrieves the
%list of reserved books.  He then returns to the class page and finally
%retrieves the class notes.  This all occurred in less than 1 minute.  The
%maximum delay between page accesses in this example was 9 seconds where the
%user went from the main page to the list of all home pages.  This was probably
%due to the fact that there were a couple of graphics to load along with the
%main page.  Here, the user
%knows what he wants and wastes no time in getting it.

%====================================
%\section{Cohesiveness of Database}
%Once the server was released for public use, changes to the database evolved in
%the manner dictated by its users.  Users found some information at the
%department level to be ineffectual and requested that they be removed.  They
%also found that some useful information was omitted and requested that it be
%added to the database.  An area where users have more control over the
%evolution of the database is in their home pages.  They included any
%information about themselves they wished to publicize to the world.  People
%generally gave some personal information and included links to their favorite
%places to visit on the Web.

%We want to see how tightly intertwined are the files in the ICS database.  We
%are not so concerned with the number of outgoing links from our site.  The
%percentage of intra-domain links over the total number of links indicates some
%level of self-awareness and concern with the happenings of the organization.

it is difficult to tell how representative this data is of the whole group.

Question 5 (Figure \ref{tab:question5a}) asked if people felt they played an
important role in the department.  Nine responded affirmatively and there was
one with no response.  Their positive responses were based on their positions
in the department.  They each had a job which they felt was important.  The
post-test shows the same sentiment as six members felt they played an important
role and one gave an unclear answer.  Two of them felt important through their
teaching and research.  One felt ``not any more significant than any other
faculty member'', which equates to a ``yes'' since the faculty generally tended
to feel a sense of significance in the department.  The last respondent felt
less important in that he ``just'' handled classes.  But he felt some
importance in that he has some leeway in determining the class content.

In question 6 (see Figure \ref{tab:question6a}), we asked if people felt a
sense of belonging in the department.  As with the previous question, nine said
they did while one only felt ``so-so''.  Their sense of belonging seemed to be
less related to their jobs.  Some felt they belonged just because they had a
``position'' in the department.  One felt that he/she belonged because of
participation in departmental affairs while the person that responded ``so-so''
said that the department ``does not do much at all anyway.''  Yet another
person felt belonging through ``longevity, if nothing else.''  In the
post-test, all seven people said they felt a sense of belonging.  One response
was that the person felt that he ``belonged here more than anywhere else''.

Responses to question 7 (Figure \ref{tab:question7a}) show that about half of

They mostly listed projects of their colleagues' and only one person mentioned

but identified fewer projects.  The research group garnering the most number of

1\% knew less than 15.  Note the different scaling in the pre-test and
post-test questionnaires.

In question 3 (Figure \ref{tab:question3s}), most students felt they could
identify less than 10 ICS faculty members by face.  About 16\% felt they could
name less than 20 ICS faculty.  Strangely, one person said they could do it for
over 30 ICS faculty.  This is an impossible feat since there are only 18 ICS
faculty members.  The post-test results show that 45\% could identify less than
a handful of the faculty while 40\% felt they could identify less than 10 of
them.  The scaling was a little different in the Pre-Test questionnaire in
which all but one could identify less than 10.  But there was some improvement
in that now 12\% can identify less than 15 faculty members.

When asked to give numeric estimates of how many faculty, graduate and
undergraduate students they think are in the department (Figure
\ref{tab:question4s}), we got a wide range of answers with relatively equal
amounts in each range, indicating most did not know the answer and were
probably just guessing.  The post-test results yielded the same results as with
the faculty.  They guessed right on how many faculty there are, but too high on
graduate students and too low on undergraduate students.  The estimate of
undergraduate students ran mainly between 50 and 100, which is just about how
many are listed under our Web site.

Question 5 (Figure \ref{tab:question5s})asked if people felt they played an
important role in the department.  About 14\% responded ``yes'' while an
overwhelming 81\% said ``no''.  As with the faculty and staff, those that
responded positively related their response to their job in the department as
being a teaching assistant or lab monitor.  These respondents seemed to think
that being paid to do something affirms one's importance.  Others felt less
important because they were not active in ICS related projects.  Some felt
unimportant because of a lack of communication between faculty, staff and
students.  One person commented on his unimportance being related to a lack of
regard for the course/instructor evaluations.  He felt students were not taken
seriously in this respect.  A large number of responses indicated that they did
not feel they played an important role because they were ``just'' students who
only attended classes while a few said they were important for the very reason
that ``students are the most important part in the university.''

department were still rather low.  It seemed that mostly the paid people felt
any sense of significance.  The students' sense of belonging seemed to be
divided.  Those that spent any amount of time on campus outside of classes were
more apt to feel belonging than those who went to class and participated in
little else concerning the department.  Many of the respondents were competent
users of the Web, finding it fun, exciting, useful and using it with some
frequency.  Students seemed to be less in the dark about departmental projects,
activities and events.

To assess the impact our Web server made on the level of community in the ICS
department, we investigated to what extent users accessed the system to garner
information on whether or not they contributed to it by publishing
information.

two places within the file system.  The first is some directory hierarchy which
serves as ``Home Base'' for any Web site.  In a networked file system which
supports multi-user access, such as the one we have in the ICS department,
there is usually only one person in charge of these files.  It may be the
system administrator and/or the webmaster.  This person generally acts as the
editor for all information published at their site.  The other area of the file
system where a Web server may serve documents is in a user's directory.  
d1550 1
a1550 9
all users who have home pages in their directories.  The second way to
contribute to our Web site was by publishing your picture on the network.  All
people had to do was to get a digitized picture of themselves and to store it
under a specific name in the above mentioned subdirectory.  As with the home
pages, another listing of people with pictures was also created for ease in
browsing.  The last way for users to directly contribute to this Web site was
through our Personal Interests Page.  Users need only modify a line in their
home page to list their hobbies.  Again, we created yet another page, which
listed different hobbies and the people associated with them.

Before the public release in January five months later, a few other users
somehow caught wind of the Web server and took the initiative in publishing
their own pages without any training.  One week after the server was publicly
released, 29\% of the faculty and staff and 55\% of the graduate students
created home pages.  This coincided with the introductory training sessions
that month to an audience of approximately 140 people.  See Figure
\ref{tab:chronology} which marks important dates and events regarding the ICS
Department's Web server public release and training schedule.  In addition to
the training, the questionnaire was administered shortly after the public
release.  The author also gave a talk to a graduate level class on her
research.

items noted in a log entry include the: hostname of the requesting client, date

indicates a successful request.  Since the log files do record hostnames or IP
addresses of requesting clients, we can selectively study accesses from IP
addresses from within our domain.  To learn how department members access

We found two main entry points from which users access the system.  Many chose
to start at the department's home page or their own personal home page.  The
unix shell script used in the training sessions had the additional feature of
configuring their system such that it would retrieve the ICS home page when
starting a particular Web browser.  This could account for people beginning
their navigation through our database at that entry point.  URLs can be very
long and appear cryptic.  For this reason, users typically do not explicitly
type them in to retrieve a document.  They can set a ``bookmark'' in their
browser such that clicking on this bookmark retrieves the associated document.
People often set bookmarks for pages they find interesting or important enough
that they plan to retrieve it again in the future.  It appears that users are
configuring their browsers to start at these entry points or setting bookmarks
for these pages.

perused several other home pages.  The hostname portion of the log was ommitted
since it is the same for any given session.  The ``/'' document refers to the
ICS home page.  A document whose pattern begins with ``/$\sim$'' and is
followed by a username refers to Web files for that user.  Requests for
graphics were omitted from this log since they are automatically downloaded on
a document request and do not contribute to navigational data.  Notice that it
took this user 12 minutes to peruse 9 home pages by various faculty and
students.  In fact, this user often spent less than a minute on some pages.

debugging and redesgning sessions can last for a few minutes or they sometimes
even drag on for hours.  Where accessing our information system is concerned,
users spent much more time designing and tailoring their Web pages than they
did in wandering through the database.  This does not imply they did not read
other information.  Once a user successfully retrieves a document, we have no
way of knowing what they did with it.  They could save it, mail it to someone,
or print it for later use.  What we do know is that they spent much time

This chapter presents the results of this experiment.  Data was collected in
two ways.  One way was through the responses we received from the pre- and
post-test questionnaires.  Another way was by collecting data directly from the
Web server using its log of all requests made.  Analysis of this data shows
what measures of community had changed within the department and how the Web
server played a role in this change.  It also shows how the Web Server can act
as a diagnostic tool for determining which factors contribute to community
building.

about inter-group relationships.  That is, in the questionnaire given to the

The pre-test (see Appendix \ref{sec:pre-test} and post-test questionnaires (see
Appendix \ref{sec:post-test} for each group differ in that the post-test
questionnaire has seven questions regarding the World Wide Web and replaces the
solitary one mentioned in the pre-test version.  The pre-test questionnaire was
administered to assess the pre-existing, or baseline sense of community.  The
post-test questionnaire, which contains the same questions plus a few more, was
administered to see how the various elements of community had changed in the
department over the course of a semester when the information system was
introduced.  The questionnaire is structured as follows:
d63 7
a69 7
\item{The first three questions deal with raw numbers.  We determine which
  group the respondent works with the most.  We then try to establish how
  many members of the department the respondent knows personally and how many
  they could identify by face.  Answers to these questions tell us how many
  other members of the department people are familiar with or know on a
  personal basis.  It also tells us how far-reaching community is for a
  single person.}

  wrong answers.  These responses tell us how self-aware are the respondents
  of their own organization.  They show us if people know how many members
  there are in the department as well as who the resident experts are and
  what different projects are being conducted by various people.}

They appear to mix well with other subgroups in the department, as there were
responses for every subgroup, (i.e. faculty, staff, graduate students and
undergraduate students) in the pre-test and nearly all subgroups in the
post-test.

The pre-test results for questions 2 and 3 shows that few faculty and staff
members initially knew many of the students while most knew only a handful.
Most of them felt they could identify less than 20 of their students.  Although
not many faculty and staff participated in the post-test, those that did
improved in getting to know their students personally and being able to
identify them by face.  We can infer they improved in this area since all
respondents indicated they filled out the pre-test questionnaire also (see

Question 4 asked to give numeric estimates of how many faculty, graduate and
undergraduate students they think are in the department.  The faculty and staff
did well in the pre-test identifying within a reasonable range the size of each
subgroup.  In the post-test, they did not do as well, guessing too high on the
graduate students and too low on the undergraduates.  It is interesting to note
that these numbers correspond to the ICS Web site's listing of students.  It
shows more than 40 graduate students and less than 100 undergraduates.
Contribution is strictly voluntary and the high number of graduate students
could include graduate students not officially in the program who are taking
ICS courses.

Question 5 asked if people felt they played an important role in the
department.  Nine responded affirmatively and there was one with no response.
Their positive responses were based on their positions in the department.  They
each had a job which they felt was important.  The post-test shows the same
sentiment as three members felt they played an important role and one gave an
unclear answer.  Two of them felt important through their teaching and
research.  One felt ``not any more significant than any other faculty member'',
which equates to a ``yes'' since the faculty generally tended to feel a sense
of significance in the department.  The last respondent felt less important in
that he ``just'' handled classes.  But he felt some importance in that he has
some leeway in determining the class content.

In question 6, we asked if people felt a sense of belonging in the department.
As with the previous question, 9 said they did while one only felt ``so-so''.
Their sense of belonging seemed to be less related to their jobs.  Some felt
they belonged just because they had a ``position'' in the department.  One felt
that he/she belonged because of participation in departmental affairs while the
person that responded ``so-so'' said that the department does not do much at
all anyway.  Yet another person felt belonging through longevity, if nothing
else.  In the post-test, all four people said they felt a sense of belonging.
One response was that the person felt that he ``belonged here more than
anywhere else''.

Responses to question 7 shows that about half of the respondents could name the
prominent research groups such as CSDL, SERL and PACCOM and some of the
individual research projects going on in the department.  They mostly listed
projects of their colleagues' and only one person mentioned this graduate
student's work.  The post-test responses yielded the same results but
identified fewer projects.  This is probably due to the fewer amount of
respondents.

The faculty and staff did well in question 8 where 80\% - 90\% of them
correctly identified the resident expert in a particular subject.  The two
exceptions are that they could not figure out who is our games expert and who
to talk to for employment opportunities.  As in the pre-test questionnaire, the
post-test results were also accurate except for identifying the games expert
and the employment opportunities expert.  In figure \ref{tab:question8a}, the
expert is listed followed by the count of ``votes'' he received.  The column
``Others'' refers to the total count of other people who garnered just a few
votes.

Question 9 shows us how people prefer to communicate.  Most people are daily
users of email and telephone.  Informal meetings ran the gamut from daily use
to never doing it at all.  Formal meetings were either done monthly or rarely
to never.  The results are the same in the post-test which shows again that
most people are daily users of email and the telephone.  Informal meetings take
place with varying frequencies and formal meetings are held monthly.

people knew of the ICS Web site, but only one had no knowledge of training
sessions offered throughout the semester.  Three felt competent in accessing
information on the Web as well as publishing information on it.  Three felt
that the ICS departmental information was useful.  One comment was that it was

With such few post-test responses, it is difficult to make any generalizations.
These respondents seemed to know the students better than they did at the start
of the experiment.  Although they could not identify the sizes of each
subgroup, they were aware of the various projects and resident experts on
different subjects.  They seemed to have a strong sense of importance and
belonging.  All but one felt they were competent users of the Web.  To what
extent can we attribute any community building to the introduction of our ICS
information system on the Web?  The only measure that seems to have noticeably
improved is that these professors seem to know the students better.  However,
this could be accomplished just by teaching one class in the passing of a
semester.  On a brighter side, they did use the system to both get and give
information and noted its usefulness.  It adds to community building just by
creating another avenue for communication.

We received 43 pre-test responses and 84 post-test responses out of a possible

undergraduates.

When asked which group they work with the most, about 70\% said they worked
most with undergraduates while 26\% said they worked most with graduate
students.  Only 3 people said they worked most with the faculty.  The post-test
yielded the same results where 73\% said they worked most with undergraduates
while 20\% said they worked most with graduate students.  Only 1 person worked
most with the faculty and 5 worked most with the staff.

members by face.  16\% felt they could name less than 20 faculty.  Strangely,
one person said they could do it for over 30 faculty.  This is an impossible
feat since there are only 18 faculty members.  The post-test results show that
45\% could identify less than a handful of the faculty while 40\% felt they
could identify less than 10 of them.  The scaling was a little different in the
pre-test questionnaire in which all but one could identify less than 10.  But
there was some improvement in that now 12\% can identify less than 15 faculty
members.

When asked to give numeric estimates of how many faculty, graduate and
undergraduate students they think are in the department, we got a wide range of
answers with an equal amount in each range, indicating most did not know the
answer and were probably just guessing.  The post-test results yielded the same
results as with the faculty.  They guessed right on how many faculty there are,
but too high on graduate students and too low on undergraduate students.  The
estimate of undergraduate students ran mainly between 50 and 100, which is just
about how many are listed under our Web site.

Question 5 asked if people felt they played an important role in the
department.  14\% responded ``yes'' while an overwhelming 81\% said ``no''.
As with the faculty and staff, those that responded positively related their
response to their job in the department as being a teaching assistant or lab
monitor.  Apparently, being paid to do something affirms one's importance.
Others felt less important because they were not active in ICS related
projects.  Some felt unimportant because of a lack of communication between
faculty, staff and students.  One person commented on his unimportance being
related to a lack of regard for the course/instructor evaluations.  He felt
students were not taken seriously in this respect.  A large number of responses
indicated that they did not feel they play an important role because they are
``just'' students who only attend classes while a few said they were important
by the fact that they are students and that a University could not do without
them.

The post-test results of question 5 were the same as in the pre-test.  14\%
responded that they felt they played a significant role in the department while
71\% felt they did not.  Somehow students felt important if there was some
tangible measure of that importance.  For example, the TAs and monitors again
were some of the few that felt important because of their positions.  Others
felt they were important because they were working with some professor on a
specific project.  But there were still those few that did not need anything
tangible and felt they were important just because they are students
representing the department.  The naysayers felt less important for many of the
same reasons as before.  They were just ``peon'' students who only took classes
and did little else to further the department.  The lack of communication
between the faculty and students also prevented students from feeling like they
were important enough to be kept informed.  Just as they did not feel they were
receiving information from the faculty, the students neither felt they had any
means of expressing their views to them.  They had ``no real venue to express
opinions about policy...''.  They also felt their course evaluations were
ignored as some professors continued in the same teaching style found to be
difficult for some.

In question 6, we asked if people felt a sense of belonging in the department.
56\% said ``yes'', 37\% said ``no'' and 1 said ``so-so''.  Those who felt they
belonged did so because they were acquainted with some faculty members and many
other students.  Sharing many of the same classes fosters this sense of
belonging.  Spending a lot of time in the building that houses the department
also seems to foster some belonging.  Some even said they belonged here in the
ICS department more than anywhere else on campus.  Those that did not feel they
belonged said so because they have little involvement in the department or that
the department does not hold any outside activities such as seminars or

mentioned that did not exist.  The post-test responses to question 7 were very
encouraging.  This time, only 13\% did not attempt to answer this question and
14\% made feeble attempts.  The rest gave a good try and were successful in
naming the different research groups.  They were also able to list individual
projects by many of the professors.

The students did not fare well in question 8 where 28\% made no attempt to
answer the question and 30\% made feeble attempts at answers.  For those that
did respond, they could only identify the resident expert in half the
categories.  The other half had a range of responses where nearly every faculty
member was listed at least once.  It is clear that most students do not know
who is the expert in what field.  The post-test yielded some interesting
insights.  10\% made no attempt to answer the question and 8\% made feeble
attempts at answers.  They did much better this time since they accurately
named the resident expert in nearly all of the categories.  For the expert in
departmental rules, students generally listed the undergraduate and graduate
advisors.  Obviously, this is who they turn to for advice whereas the faculty
named the chairman, their boss, as the expert in this category.  The category
of computer network expert also yielded interesting answers.  Students listed
the last 2 professors who taught that course.  Only one student listed the
person which the faculty felt was the network expert.  Since that faculty
member rarely teaches, most students do not know him nor that there is big work
being done in that field.  Unlike the professors, students knew of the computer
games expert.  As with the department rules, students listed their advisors for
knowledge in employment opportunities.

In question 9, we see that 67\% of students use email on a daily basis and 42\%
also use the telephone daily.  Almost no one uses a fax machine or holds formal
meetings to communicate.  Informal meetings are held with varying frequencies.
The post-test shows the same results where 73\% of students use email on a
daily basis and 46\% also use the telephone daily.  Informal meetings are held
with varying frequencies, but mostly on a weekly basis.

The following pertains to questions 10-15.  Only 4 people (5\%) of the
respondents said they did not know the department had a Web site.  Most found
out either through email, a friend or their professor.  57\% found the training
sessions useful and 20\% thought they were frequently and flexibly scheduled
while 14\% did not bother to attend them.  Most of the students averages usage
of the ICS Department's web site between a few times a month to a few times a
week.  69\% felt they were competent Web surfers but only 19\% were confident
in Web publishing.  However, 27\% felt that they were not competent in using
the World Wide Web.  The main reason students (67\%) are using the Web is that
it is fun and exciting.  Other reasons were that it makes navigation of the
Internet simple (49\%) and that it was required by their professor(42\%).  Only
5\% still did not use the Web.

a1081 12
When asked whether the Web information presented on the department was useful
17\% thought that is was.  One thought it was entertaining, one thought it was
``so-so'', and two did not think it was useful.  Most students found it useful
in getting course information, assignments and lecture notes.  The rest liked
that it helped them learn more about other people in the department.  One
commented, ``It was interesting to see the interests of others through their
home pages.  I think it would be better if ALL people in the department were on
the page.''  Another said ``I liked the fact that everyone has a home page and
most with their picture on it.  That way I can put a name with a face and their
work and interests.''

department.  There were only 8 in the pre-test who wished to comment.  Three
felt no sense of community at all because of a lack of communication within
the department.  Students never seem to know if there are any projects or
activities going on.  They also have no idea who the other ICS majors are
except for those in their classes.  One person expressed a desire for a list of
such students.  Others felt the absence of community because of poor computing
resources offered to the students in the department, particularly the
undergraduates.  They have no lab, as do the graduate students.  They must
compete for resources with other non-ICS majors.  This is extremely difficult
as ICS majors spend much more time on the computer than do most other students.
One student commented on his lack of support in learning new technologies
citing the ``You just learn it'' advice many computer science students face
because they tend to be better at such activities.  Another person mentioned
the high competition between students as prohibitive to community development.

department.  They did not know many faculty members well nor could identify
them by face.  They could not cite the size of each subgroup, the major
research projects nor the resident experts.  They generally did not feel they
played a significant role in the department.  Perhaps this is largely due to the
fact that students pay to go to school whereas faculty and staff members are
paid to be in school.  The one bright spot is that more than half did feel a
sense of belonging in the department.  It is not all that is needed in a
community, but it is a start.

department are still rather low.  It seems that mostly the paid people feel any
sense of significance.  The students' sense of belonging seems to be divided.
Those that spend any amount of time on campus outside of classes are most apt
to feel belonging than those who go to class and participate in little else
concerning the department.  Many of the respondents are competent users of the
Web, finding it fun, exciting, useful and using it with some frequency.  They
like that the Web has opened up another avenue of communication.  Students are
less in the dark about departmental projects, activities and events.  They have
a safe way to express their individuality and learn about others in the
process.  Graduate students seem more close-knit as they spend much time
together in the lab working and discussing their respective projects.
Undergraduate students are alienated through their lack of a meeting place,
poor computing resources and less encouragement to actively pursue a serious
project for their degree plan.

\subsection{Usage Patterns}
We are interested in assessing the impact our Web server makes on the sense of
community in the ICS department.  We need to know to what extent users are
accessing the system to garner information and whether or not they are
contributing to it by publishing information.
d1438 7
a1444 7
\subsubsection{User Contribution}
Any user may directly contribute to the ICS Web information system.  We say
directly in that there is no middle man involved in this contribution.  As with
most publications, the data to be published must be cleared by some editor
before everything goes public.  That is not the case here.  Users are given
free reign in this department.  We are not trying to be overly democratic in
wanting to increase the sense of community here.  It simply happens to be an
d1465 16
a1480 16
process was facilitated by script written by the author.  The script was a
program such that when executed, it would create a personalized home page for
that user.  Instructions on this procedure were also given online.  Users who
liked to learn things on their own were also free to look up numerous
references on the creation of an HTML document.  Having an accessible home page
is only useful if people know its URL, or address.  To simplify matters for
people browsing our system, we automatically created a listing of all users who
have home pages in their directories.  The second way to contribute to the Web
site was by publishing your picture on the network.  All people had to do was
to get a digitized picture of themselves and to store it under a specific name
in the above mentioned subdirectory.  As with the home pages, another listing
of people with pictures was also created for ease in browsing.  The last way
for users to directly contribute to this Web site was through our Personal
Interests Page.  Users need only modify a line in their home page to list their
hobbies.  Again, we created yet another list of different hobbies and the
people associated with them.
d1487 1

are about 10?? of these students.  Undergraduates are accommodated by the
d1489 7
a1495 6
maintained by the department.  Only users with accounts on this network may
publish home pages.  This posed the problem of accommodating the undergraduates,
who make up the vast majority of the department.  To alleviate this problem, we
coordinated with the University's computing center to allow undergraduates full
authorship on the Web.  They are publishing on a different network, but lists
and links to undergraduate pages are still maintained by the ICS department.

Analysis of the log files for the ICS network reveals user participation of
d1506 11
a1516 14
Before the public release in January five months later, less than 5 users per
month somehow caught wind of the Web server and took the initiative in
publishing their own pages without any training.  Once the server was publicly
released, participation nearly tripled to 66 home pages by the end of January.
This coincided with the introductory training sessions that month to an
audience of approximately 140 people.  See Figure \ref{tab:chronology} which
marks important dates and events regarding the ICS Department's Web server
public release and training schedule.  In addition to the training, the
questionnaire was administered shortly after the public release.  The author
also gave a talk to a graduate level class on her research.  This amounts to
48\% contribution by faculty and staff, 89\% by graduate students and 8\% by
undergraduates after five months of testing and setup and only a month of
advertising.  See Fig ?? for a graph of how home page creation has evolved for
the different subgroups since the information system's inception.  
d1519 13
a1531 16
do not maintain the log files for their system.  They were only able to provide
us with logfiles beginning January 22, 1995.  They were also missing the week
of Feb 5-12.  During these ``missing'' dates, in Fig ??(Home Pages Created in
Spring 95) we can see a lull in the creation of home pages for undergraduates.
However, the general trend is that there is a steady increase in home pages
until mid-February when training had slowed down.  It picked up a month later
when training resumed.  As for the graduate students, their increase in
activity picked up at the start of the semester and leveled off starting in
February.  However there were nearly 50 home pages at that time, which exceeds
the approximate total of 38 graduate students.  The high number comes from the
fact that any user with an account on this file system may publish on the Web.
Not all users are official graduate students in the department.  There may be
others taking ICS graduate courses who have temporary accounts.  So by the end
of the semester, we got near maximum participation by the graduate students.
But we had only 36\% participation by the undergraduates by semester's end.  As
for the faculty and staff, about 62\% created home pages by the end of April.

\subsubsection{Access Patterns}
We can study access patterns of our database by analyzing our log files.
Although we do not have an explicit measure for knowing which user accessed
what information, we can gather this implicitly.  Since the log files do record
hostnames or IP addresses of requesting clients, we can selectively study
accesses from IP addresses from within our domain.  We want to see how the
people in our department access our Web site.  So we chose 10 workstations in
the lab, all of which get on the average 12 hours of daily use by various
people.  We can heuristically identify different ``sessions'' as request
sequences with less than 5 minutes between successive requests.
d1583 10
a1592 5
From this data, we found two main entry points from which users access the
system.  When starting up any Web browser, users have the choice of which
document they wish to bring up at each invocation of the application.  Many
choose this default page to be either the department's home page or their own
personal home page.
d1594 15
a1608 5
There are three basic patterns we found when analyzing this data.  People initially browse information semi-exhaustively to get a sense of what
information is out there.  They do not spend much time on any single
document, as they simply wish to quickly traverse the system.  We say
semi-exhaustively since they usually do not go through every single link, but
look at a great many of them.  
d1610 8
a1617 1
%insert example sans non-html accesses here
d1619 12

Another way people browse is to retrieve a specific piece of information.
For example, people often access the database to get homework assignment or
lecture notes.  The following excerpt from the log files shows a student
entering at the department's main entry point, traversing to the listing of all
user home pages to find his/her professor.  From there, he goes to the class
page and retrieves the list of reserved books.  He then returns to the class
page and finally retrieves the class notes.  This all occurred in a matter of 2
minutes.  The maximum delay between page accesses in this example was 9
seconds where the user went from the main page to the list of all home pages.
This was probably due to the fact that there were a couple of graphics to load
along with the main page.  Here, the user knows what he wants and wastes no
time in getting it.

The last type of access pattern is that of a user working hard on a document to
publish or script to run.  These sessions usually drag on for hours with
several rather short mini-sessions in between.  There were several classes
during this semester which required use of the Web.  One in particular required
students to actively publish and create forms and scripts for interactive use
of the database.  A typical access session may involve the user starting at his
home page, traversing to the class' home page and then to their respective
project.  The user may spend 3 minutes per session, debugging links and then
they stop for longer overhauls of their works.  Then they return
perhaps 20 minutes later and continue in the same vein for the next few hours.
