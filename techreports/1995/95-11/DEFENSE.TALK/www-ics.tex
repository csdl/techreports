  {\bf Comments from a ICS member:}
  \horizontalline
  \begin{verbatim}
``I think that the ICS Web Site has been the
closest to a community that we've had among
the undergrads...We all can learn about about
each other in a safe environment...[our Web 
pages] allow others to get to know us without
even meeting us.''

\begin{slide}\Huge 
  {\bf Conclusions}
  \horizontalline
  \begin{itemize}
  \item System had no appreciable effect on faculty \& staff
