\chapter{Instructions for Pre-/Post-Test Questionnaires}
\label{sec:instructions}
Aloha.  I am a graduate student in the Information and Computer Sciences (ICS)
Department.  For my master's thesis, I am doing research on computer network
communities. To support this project, I would like to learn about the current
sense of community within the Department of Information and Computer Sciences.

If you would like to participate in this research, please take a few minutes to
answer the following questions, and return it to me electronically
(rosea@uhics.ics.hawaii.edu) or by hardcopy. I expect it will take 5-10 minutes
of your time to complete.

Your participation will be kept strictly confidential.  All answers reported in
my research will be kept anonymous.  You can place your hardcopy questionnaire
in a box labeled ``Questionnaires'' in Keller 318.

As an incentive for participating in this research, I will enter all
contributors in a drawing for a \$30 gift certificate to a local restaurant of
your choosing.  Those who respond by email will be automatically entered in the
drawing.  Those turning in a hardcopy may detach the bottom portion of this
form and drop it in the box marked ``Drawing Entries'' in Keller 318.

Results from this research will be made available in July, 1995. Please submit
your all items by placing them in their respective boxes in Keller 318.  
\\ \\
Thank you for your participation.\\
