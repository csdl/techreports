\item Problems that I had with paraphrasing technique (please
explain):
\begin{itemize}
\item Sometimes it just seemed so ridculous to paraphrase statements which
were obvious.
\item Need to understand C++ better before trying.  Hard to visualize what
happens in the program without seeing what it does
\item No real problems, I actually found it really useful.
\item It is difficult to find errors by reading.  Need to view limits and
processes.

\item none
\item No problems really.

\item I had problem with finding correct terms to explain some of instances
found during the discussion.

\item the paraphrasing was tedious, but I understand that it is necessary
\item If the code was not clar at the time it lead to broken sentences

\item none

\item not anything that was so terrible
\end{itemize}


\item Problems that I had with the presenter (please explain):
\begin{itemize}
\item None.  Listened to every issue, made sure he has thorough when
searching the code.
\item No problems.  He did his job well and fielded the 
 discussions quite nicely.
\item Presenting was hard to adjust to.  We would need to try some different
processes over a period of time to get it "right".  It would take time
to know what a good presenter does.
\item none, presenter was efficient.
\item I was the presenter.  I could critique myself as not paraphrasing
adequately enough.
\item N/A
\item none
\item I was the presenter so none!
\item none

\item Sometimes he forgot about me and didn't really pay attention
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item None.  Very patient and helpful.
\item None.
\item The system is hard to process in a formal way for the first time.  The
moderator might help more by giving some direction.
\item none.
\item None.  He was very helpful.
\item N/A
\item none
\item None
\item none
\item none
\end{itemize}

\item Problems that I had with the moderator (please explain):
\begin{itemize}
\item Several times I forgot to save issues or clicked in the wrong spot and
threw everything off.
\item None.  Easy to work with, but may depend on who is in your group.
Must be able to get along, not be afraid to share.
\item time constrain
\item None.
\item none. was easy to use and intuitive.
\item None in particular.
\item the system kept freezing when in the midst of creating an issue..
\item none, it works very well and is easy to use
\item Could use a more user friendly interface
\item none
\item none I enjoyed it
\end{itemize}

\item Problems that I had with EGSM system (please explain): 
\begin{itemize}
\item It seemed to be quite tedious at times
\item Very long.
\item take time to sort out disagreements

\item None.
\item none.
\item The use of separate terminals was a large problem.  I found myself
looking at the speakers' terminals insteads.  I felt I needed
eye-contact with them.  Also, referring to a line is much easier
pointing to it on their screen rather than telling them what line to
look at.
\item None in particular.
\item I wish we had reference materials on c++ so our time wouldn't be
wasted on things we should have known

\item Good well thought out
\item none
\item none
\end{itemize}

\item Problems that I had with EGSM process (please explain): 

\begin{itemize}
\item There should be less chance of serious error for mistakes like
clicking in the wrong spot.  Also, issue-saving and summary
buffer-refreshing should be automatic.
\item Allow for bringing in reference material.  Hard to remember everything
-- having some examples to look at would make it easier.
\item Screens should be more inactive between reviewers and presenter.

\item None.
\item Line numbers might be just put in by number instead of using the
mouse.  A list of the errors on a given page could help discuss why
this is a new error - when we find more than one error in an area.
\item none.
\item Require only one terminal to be used.  
\item Given more time, our group could have been more productive.
\item None
\item none
\item Needed more time.  Maybe several shorter sessions.
\item for this to work the presenter needs to be on the  ball
\end{itemize}


\item Suggestions on how to improve EGSM system (please explain):

\begin{itemize}
\item Only paraphrase statements that there is some doubt about as sort of a
helping tool.
\item Same as above
\item None.
\item bibe.
\item Have another secondary presenter or something, just in case the
presenter interprets the a statement wrong.
\item Students must be given better access to the system. 
\item The group would work best if all involved can express themselves clearly
\item none
\end{itemize}


\item Suggestions on how to improve EGSM process (please explain):
\begin{itemize}
\item None.
\item This is a good system
\item The way people sign up for the time slots to do this project is 
not sufficient.  A possibly better way to do it would be to create 
a sign in sheet with predesignated times.  This would prevent students
from all coming in at the same time.
\item Some of the code was really difficult to comprehend even with other
people.  Should have a maximum time limit.
\item none
\item Wonderful system.  It's about time such a system was developed.  Until
now, I have never heard of a group like this.  This would surely kill
the bugs that plague a program.
\item Special thanks to the TA.
\item really enjoyed doing this stuff, 
\item None
\item I thought the technique was very good.  Although, I time spent looking
for bugs was draining.  I suggest shorter sessions so that the group
could relax.
\item 
I think this kind of programme is very useful for learning the code
written by other people.  This really helped me in better
understanding of logic and issues that we came across, which I never
thought to be of importance and usually ignored it.  I learned a lot
from this programme.  I request that all the ICS classes should have
this kind of practice.  Overall, Danu is an excellent guide and
explains well what he expects from us. Above all, this is an excellent
programme.  Much Mahalos!
