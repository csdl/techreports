  HBS is an 11 KLOC Hypertext Multiuser Database Server written in
  C++. HBS is designed to work with ECS clients, as part of the Egret
  client-server system.  HBS is broken down into four blocks, File
  Operations, Basic Hypertext Operations, Events and Locks, and
  Client/Server Operations.  There is also a built in debugging mechanism
  and memory leak detection system.  This document describes the internal
  design of HBS.

  The HBS is a 11KLOC HyperText Multiuser Database Server written in
  C++. It is broken down into four blocks, File Operations, Basic Hypertext
  Operations, Events and Locks, and Client/Server Operations.  There is
  also a built in debugging mechanism and memory leak detection system.
  The HBS has also been designed to be easily extended to support new
  operations.
