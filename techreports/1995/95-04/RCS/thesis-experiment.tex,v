\chapter{A Case Study of AEN}
\label{sec:evaluation}

This chapter discusses the Spring 1995 case study of AEN.  Section
\ref{sec:casestudy} presents the questions the case study is trying to
answer.  Section \ref{sec:method} discusses the method used in the case
study.  Section \ref{sec:datacollection} introduces the data that will be
collected in the study.  Section \ref{sec:dataanalysis} describes the ways
the data will be analyzed to determine if AEN supports strong
collaboration.  The last section concludes the chapter with a discussion of
some of the limitations of this study.

\section{Spring 1995 Case Study}
\label{sec:casestudy}

After implementing and using AEN during Fall, 1994, I had two major
questions: (1) Does AEN support strong collaboration? and (2) What
computational support is needed for strong collaboration?

One approach to answering these question would have been a controlled,
experimental study where the interactions, and authoring styles of a group
using AEN is compared to that of a group not using AEN.  However,
methodological and resource problems prevented that approach.  Instead, I
decided to first operationalize the definition of strong collaboration as a
set of measurable collaborative behaviors, then test to see to what degree
a group of AEN users exhibit those behaviors.  

\section{Operationalized Definition of Strong Collaboration}
\label{sec:operationalized-definition}
 
The operationalized definition of strong collaboration consists of four
classes of observable collaborative behaviors.  For each behavior, I have
defined one or more metrics.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{\em Members read each other's nodes.}  Any form of collaboration
  requires that the members of the group know what other members have
  contributed. 
  
  % Without reading the other nodes members have no way of
  %  contributing to the nodes.
  
  {\bf Metric:} {\em Readers per node (RPN)}.  This metric calculates the
  average number of readers per node for a group. For example, for a
  group of five, the lowest RPN value is one, indicating that no member
  of the group read any nodes other than those he created.  The highest
  possible RPN value for this group of five is five, indicating that every member
  read every node.
  
  
  
%\item{\em Members edit nodes that were also edited by others.}  This
%  is the most direct way that members can collaborate on a node.  One author
%  creates a node, then another author adds to it.
%  
%  {\bf Metric:} {\em Member Co-editing (MCE)}.  This metric calculates
%  the average number of members that each member co-edits with. For a
%  group of five, the lowest MCE value is one, indicating that no member
%  of the group edited nodes that any other member edited.  The highest
%  possible MCE value for this group is five, indicating that every member
%  edited every node with every other member.

\item{\em Document nodes are edited by more than one person.}  This
  component of the operationalized definition assesses the degree to
  which multiple authorship occurs.  Only document nodes are included in
  this assessment, since other node types (comment, quicky quiz, and
  quicky quiz answers) are by definition singly authored.  

  {\bf Metric:} {\em Editors per node (EPN)}.  This metric calculates the
  average number of editors per node.  The lowest EPN value possible, for
  a group of five, is one, indicating that each node was only edited by
  one member.  The highest possible EPN value for this group is five,
  indicating that every node was edited by all five group members.

\item{\em Members create feedback nodes.}  This is another way for group
  members to collaborate.  They can create feedback on the contents of a
  node.

  {\bf Metric:} {\em Feedback Node Creation (FNC)}.  This metric
  calculates the percentage of document nodes that have been commented
  on.  The lowest possible FNC value is 0\%, indicating that no document
  nodes were commented on.  The highest FNC value is 100\%, indicating that
  all document nodes were commented on.


\item{\em Members manipulate access control to publish/protect documents
  under development.}  By changing the access control members are able to
  dynamically control the process of collaboration.  Changing the access
  control from the default allows collaboration on a node.  Changing the
  access control for a node more than once indicates that the mode of
  collaboration changed for that node.

  {\bf Metric:} {\em Non-default Access Control (NAC)}.  This metric
  calculates the percentage of nodes that have had their access control
  changed from the default.  The lowest NAC value possible is 0\%, indicating
  that no nodes had their access control changed from the default.
  This also indicates that there was no interaction among the members
  since the default access control is no access for other members.  The
  highest possible NAC value is 100\%, indicating that every node has had its
  access control modified.

  {\bf Metric:} {\em Evolving Access Control (EAC)}.  This metric
  calculates the percentage of document nodes that have had their access
  control changed more than once. This metric measures the degree to
  which the groups' collaboration changed. The lowest EAC value possible
  is 0\%, indicating that no nodes had their access control changed more
  than once.  The highest possible EAC value is 100\%, indicating that
  all nodes had their access control changed more than once.

\end{enumerate}


These metrics characterize many aspects of collaborative behaviors.
Specifically, a group that exhibits uniformly high values for each of these
metrics can be said to be exhibiting ``pure'' strong collaboration.  Of
course, intermediate levels of these metrics still indicate at least a
partial presence of strong collaboration.  In order to evaluate
AEN's set of tools, tool use will be monitored and a post study survey will
ask the participants their impressions of the tools.

\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

The basic method for this research was to administer a pre-test questionnaire,
collect metrics data generated, collect bug reports and suggestions, and
administer a post-test questionnaire.  The study lasted from March 3, 1995 to
May 5, 1995.  The data was analyzed both during and at the end of the
experiment.

The Spring 1995 ICS 413, an undergraduate senior level class, was studying
software engineering.  The class was divided into five teams.  Each team
had five members.  The teams were developing a software product to be used
by an organization outside of the university.  This involved developing and
maintaining several documents, including a requirements document, design
specification, project proposal, and project schedule.  Three of the five
teams participated in this study.  I will refer to them as A, B and C.
Teams A and C consisted of all seniors, while team B had two graduate
students and three seniors.  These three teams used AEN to develop their
requirements document.  During case study, I monitored the teams' use of
AEN to create their requirements documents.

The structure of this document was roughly defined for all teams.  The
contents of the individual team's documents were different since they were
developing different software systems.

\section{Data Collection}
\label{sec:datacollection}

During this case study three types of data were collected: metrics on AEN
use, user questionnaires, and user feedback/bug reports.  The following
sections discuss each in turn.

\subsection{Metrics}
\label{sec:metrics-description}

AEN collects and stores metrics for each user.  All metrics entries have
the same format:  [$<$metrics identifier$>$ $<$encoded time string$>$
$<$metrics type$>$ $<$node-ID$>$ $<$additional information$>$].  The syntax
for AEN's metrics is shown in Figure \ref{fig:BNF}
\small
\begin{figure}
  \begin{verbatim}
<AEN metric> ::= [mt*event "encoded Egret time string" <metrics type>
                Egret node-ID <additional information>]

<metrics type> ::= create | write | <lock type> | <toggle-access type> | 
                   <set-access type> | make-TOC | <make node list type> |
                   start-snoopy | stop-snoopy | start-partyline | 
                   stop-partyline | send

<additional information> ::= type of node | user added to access control 
                             list | new access control list | 
                             recipients of partyline message


<lock type> ::= lock | lock-to-annotate 

<toggle-access type> ::= toggle-read-access | toggle-write-access |
                         toggle-annotation-access 

<set-access type> ::= set-read-access | set-write-access |
                      set-annotation-access

<make node list type> ::= make-node-list-unread | make-node-list-type |
                          make-node-list-owner 

\end{verbatim}
\caption{Syntax of AEN's Metrics}
\label{fig:BNF}
\end{figure}
\normalsize

 An example
of a single metrics entry is the following:

\small
\begin{verbatim}
[mt*event "52@@;:_" create 12 (type document)]
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

This metric indicates that on February 16, 1995 at 11:10:47, the user
created a document node with ID 12.

Metrics are collected on the following events:

\begin{itemize}

\item{\em Node creation.}  The create node metric stores the time, the
  node-ID and the type of node created (document and comment).

\item{\em Reading the contents of a node.} The read metric stores the time,
  the node-ID and type of the node.

\item{\em Changing the contents of a node.} The write metric stores the
  time, and the node-ID of the node.

\item{\em Locking of nodes.} The locking metric stores the time, the type
  of locking action (lock to write, lock to annotate) and the node-ID.

\item{\em Changing the access privileges for a node.} The access metric
  stores the time, the node-ID and the new access privilege list.

\item{\em Creating a Table of Contents.} Creating a TOC stores the time,
  the db-ID and if it is a local TOC the node-ID of the top of the TOC.

\item{\em Creating a Node list.} A metric is generated for the different
  types of node lists (documents, comments, quicky quizzes, quicky quiz
  answers).

\item{\em Creating an Unread Nodes list.} A metric is generated for the
  different types of node lists (documents, comments, quicky quizzes, quicky
  quiz answers).

\item{\em Starting and stopping Partyline and Snoopy.} Starting these
  applications stores the time and the db-ID.

\item{\em Sending a Partyline message.} Sending a Partyline message stores
  the time of the message and the person(s) the message is sent to.  The
  contents of the message is not saved.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{Questionnaires}

Two questionnaires were developed to gain information about the users and
their evaluation of the system.  The first questionnaire, administered at
the beginning of the study, requested information about the user's
background and knowledge of hypertext and computer supported collaborative
work.  The second questionnaire, administered at the end of the study,
requested information on the user's feeling on AEN and their views on the
different tools AEN provides. Appendices \ref{app:questionnaire1} and
\ref{app:questionnaire2} contain the two questionnaires.

\subsection{Feedback/Bug reports}

A final form of data collected during the study was on-line comments on the
system produced by users.  AEN has a Feedback menu that allows the users to
send suggestions and bug reports.  These suggestions and bug reports were
used to improve AEN and as a source of ideas for future enhancements.

\section{Data Analysis}
\label{sec:dataanalysis}

The primary purpose of the case study was to find out how authors
collaborate when using AEN.  My intent was to evaluate the utility of AEN
and provide a foundation for more complete comparative studies that might be
designed and conducted.  The analysis techniques were descriptive.

The data collected consisted of metrics data, user suggestions, bug reports
and user questionnaires.  The metrics data, AEN collected, was used to
calculate the five collaborative metrics for each group.  The number of bug
reports from the Fall 1994, semester was compared to the number of bug
reports from the Spring 1995, semester to measure the change in reliability
of AEN.  The metrics on tool use and user questionnaires assessed the
frequency of use and subjective value of different tools.

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
There are four significant limitations to this study; the learning curve of
the participants, workstation availability, face-to-face off-line
collaboration, and learning to collaborate vs. learning to collaborate
strongly. 

The first limitation, the learning curve of the participants, was
significant since AEN is a complex system.  AEN is built upon the XEmacs
editor, which is itself complex and non-trivial to learn.  The participants were
trained to use XEmacs as well as AEN.  However, at the end of the study one
student remarked,
\begin{quote} {\em I'm sorry to say, it still frustrates me.  I just can't
get a grasp of it, so I basically just wrote my documents and never did
anything else.}
\end{quote}
The training and on-line documentation attempted to alleviate this
limitation.

The second and third limitations are closely related.  The availability of
workstations for the participants was very limited.  However, since AEN
supports asynchronous collaboration, the number of workstations needed at
any one time was reduced.  The workstations used by the participants were
located in two rooms.  This physical feature of the study environment led
to the third limitation of the study, face-to-face collaboration off-line.
Often, when participants worked synchronously, they were in the same room
and could collaborate off-line.  I had no way to collect or measure their
off-line collaboration.  I could have recorded the participants off-line
conversations, but I did not restrict the times the participants used AEN.
This made it impossible to record all of the off-line collaboration.

The last limitation, learning to collaborate vs. learning to collaborate
strongly, was significant.  None of the groups had worked together before
the study.  Thus, the participants had to learn how to collaborate with
each other before they could learn to collaborate strongly.  One student
remarked, {\em ``the only problem was that we needed to have a set of
procedures on how to use AEN.''}  Training and suggestions about how to
collaborate attempted to alleviate this limitation.

limitations of this study.
d33 3

After implementing and using AEN during Fall, 1994, our focus turned to
evaluation of AEN's support for strong collaboration and what computational
support is needed for strong collaboration.
d37 1
a37 1
One approach to answering this question would have been a controlled,
d41 3
a43 5
decided to first operationalize strong collaboration as a set of
collaborative behaviors, then test to see to what degree a group of AEN
users exhibit those behaviors.  The following
is our operationalized definitions and corresponding metrics for strong
collaboration:
d45 7
d53 26
a78 4
\item{\em Members read each other's nodes.}  Strong collaboration requires
  that the members of the group know the current state of the artifact.
  Without reading the other nodes members have no way of contributing to
  the nodes.
a79 10
  {\bf Metric:} {\em Readers per node (RPN)}.  This metric measures the
  number of readers per node.  

\item{\em Members edit nodes that were also edited by others.}  This
  is the most direct way that members can collaborate on a node.  One author
  creates a node, then another author adds to it.

  {\bf Metric:} {\em Member Co-editing (MCE)}.  This metric measures the
  number of members that each member co-edits with.
 
d81 4
a84 3
  operationalization ensures that there is interaction among the group
  members for each node.  Without this interaction the node is created in a
  weakly collaborative way.
d86 5
a90 2
  {\bf Metric:} {\em Editors per node (EPN)}.  This metric measures the
  number of editors per node.
d96 5
a100 2
  {\bf Metric:} {\em Feedback Node Creation (FNC)}.  This metric measures
  the number of feedback nodes created by each member.

  dynamically control the process of collaboration.
d110 17
a126 5
  {\bf Metric:} {\em Non-default Access Control (NAC)} and {\em Evolving
  Access Control (EAC)}.  These metrics measure two different features of
  access control.  NAC measures if the node's access control has changed
  from the default and EAC measures if then node's access control has
  evolved over the life of the node.
d130 5
a134 4
The above collaborative metrics will detect occurrences of the collaborative
behaviors.  In order to evaluate AEN's set of tools, tool use will be
monitored and a post study survey will ask the participants their
impressions of the tools.

The method for this survey was to administer a pre-test questionnaire,

their evaluation of the system.  The first questionnaire determines the
user's background and knowledge of hypertext and computer supported

and user questionnaires.  The metrics data for each user was modified to
include their user name.  Then all the metrics data for a group were
combined and sorted by time string.  This allowed us to see a time line of
user activity in AEN.  By filtering out the different types of events for
each node owned by the group we were able to see how the groups collaborated
on each node in their design document.  The metrics on tool use and user

There are four significant limitations to this study; one, the learning
curve of the participants, two, workstation availability, three,
face-to-face off-line collaboration, and four, learning to collaborate
vs. learning to collaborate strongly.  Each limitation will be discussed in
turn.
d307 11
a317 7
The first limitation, the learning curve of the participants was
significant since, AEN is a complex system.  It is built upon the XEmacs
editor which in itself is complex.  The groups were trained on XEmacs as
well as AEN.  However, at the end of the study one student remarked, ``I'm
sorry to say, it still frustrates me.  I just can't get a grasp of it, so I
basically just wrote my documents and never did anything else.'' The
training and on-line documentation attempted to alleviate this limitation.

a329 9
workstations for the participants was very limited.  Since AEN supports
asynchronous collaboration the number of workstations needed at any one
time was reduced.  The workstations that were available to the participants
were all in one room.  This leads to the third limitation of the study,
face-to-face collaboration off-line.  When participants worked
synchronously we had no way to collect their off-line collaboration.  We
could have recorded the participants off-line conversations, but we did not
restrict the times the participants used AEN.  This made it impossible to
record all of the off-line collaboration.

\section{Introduction}
a29 12
In the summer of 1994, we developed the initial requirements behind AEN.  As
we implemented the system our ideas about collaboration evolved.  We
started out looking for the tools that helped build a collaborative
hypertext document.  In Fall, 1994, we both implemented and used AEN in ICS
613.  This process redefined the requirements of AEN, but did not
rigorously evaluate them.  During this process, the notion of our system as
a testbed for ``strong collaboration'' emerged.  However, during this
initial usage strong collaboration did not occur except in isolated
circumstances, because of system frailty and incompleteness.  In Spring,
1995, a case study approach is used to better understand the system and its
support for ``strong collaboration''.

We are interested in finding out if the design of AEN supports ``strong
collaboration''.  Strong collaboration was originally defined as:
d37 8
a44 17
\begin{quote}

  By ``strong collaboration'', we mean to evoke situations in which a group
  synergistically develops and improves a structured artifact more
  efficiently and effectively than would be possible by the same group of
  people working independently.\cite{csdl-94-20}

\end{quote}

One approach to answering this question would be a controlled, experimental
study where the efficiency and effectiveness of a group using AEN is
compared to that of a group not using AEN.  However, methodological and
resource problems prevent that approach in this research at this time.
Instead, our approach is to first operationalize ``strong collaboration''
as a set of collaborative behaviors, and then test to see whether a group
of AEN users exhibit those behaviors.  This operationalized definition of
``strong collaboration'' is as follows:

The method for this experiment is to administer a pre-test questionnaire to
the groups of the Spring 1995 ICS 413 class that are participating in the
study, collect metrics data generated by both authors and readers of the
hypertext, collect bug reports and suggestions, and administer a post-test
questionnaire at the end of the experiment. The experiment will start on 3
Mar 1995 and data collection will end on 26 Mar 1995.  The data will be
analyzed both during and at the end of the experiment.

including a requirements document, design specification,project proposal,
and project schedule. Three of the five teams will participate in this
study.  These three teams will use AEN to develop their requirements

During this case study three types of data will be collected: metrics on
AEN use, user questionnaires, and user feedback/bug reports.  The following
sections will discuss each in turn.

Two questionnaires will be developed to gain information about the users
and their evaluation of the system.  The first questionnaire will determine
the user's background and knowledge of hypertext and computer supported
collaborative work.  The second questionnaire will focus on the user's
feeling on AEN and their current views on computer supported collaborative
work. Appendicies \ref{app:questionnaire1} and \ref{app:questionnaire2}
contain the two questionnaires.

The data collected will consist of metrics data, user suggestions, bug
reports and user questionnaires.  The metrics data for each user will be
collected and modified to include their user name.  Then all the metrics
data will be combined and sorted by time string.  This will allow us to see
a timeline of user activity in AEN.  From this combined data we will also
determine all of the document nodes that were created.  The next sections
show how the data can be used to identify occurrences of each behavior in
the operationalized definition of ``strong collaboration''.  For
simplicity, the group being analyzed has only three members, {\tt cmoore},
{\tt johnson}, and {\tt rosea}.

\item{\em A majority of members create feedback nodes.}

  By searching the combined metrics data we can find all the occurrences of
  comment node creation for the members.  Figure \ref{fig:feedback} shows all
  three members of the group have created feedback nodes.

\item{\em A majority of members read each other's nodes.}

  A query to the Unread Nodes agent will tell us which nodes have not been
  read for each user.  Given this list of unread nodes we can determine if
  the owner for each of them and see if the members read all of the other
  members nodes.

\item{\em If team members are simultaneously logged in, Partyline is used.}

  The combined metrics will show us when team members are simultaneously
  logged in.  During each of these events we can search for Partyline
  activity.  Figure \ref{example:realTime} shows two users communicating in
  real time. {\tt johnson} and {\tt cmoore} have a short conversation.

\item{\em Each member edits nodes that were also edited by others.}

  By looking at the combined metrics we can see when members edit a node that
  another member has edited.  Figure \ref{fig:trading} shows each member
  editing node 1428.

\item{\em All document nodes are edited by more than one person.}

  We can get a list of all of the document nodes by using the following
  command in AEN:
  \begin{verbatim}
(aen*{document}*node-IDs db-ID)
  \end{verbatim}
  By looking at all the document nodes in AEN and the combined metrics,
  we will be able to see if each document node was edited by more than
  one member of the team.

\item{\em All members find the Snoopy and Partyline features for physical
  presence to be useful.}

  The post-test questionnaire will ask the participants if they feel Snoopy
  and Partyline provided them with a sense of physical presence.  The
  questionnaire will also ask if they felt that Snoopy and Partyline were
  useful in supporting collaboration.

\item{\em Members manipulate access control to publish/protect artifacts
  under development.}

  By searching the combined metrics data we can find where each member
  manipulated the access control for a node.  Figure \ref{fig:manip} shows
  each user manipulating the access control mechanism in different ways.
  {\tt cmoore} allows the other members read and annotation access.  {\tt
  johnson} is just letting the other members read his comment.  {\tt rosea}
  is allowing all the members to read the comment.  {\tt cmoore} can create
  comments on {\tt rosea}'s comment while {\tt johnson} can edit the comment.

  manipulated.

\section{Limitations and Assumptions}
\paragraph {Limitations}
\begin{itemizenoindent}
\item{\em Learning curve}: AEN is a complex system built upon the XEmacs
  editor.  New users will have to learn how to use AEN as well as XEmacs.
  I will be training the groups on the use of AEN to help lower the
  learning curve.  I will throw out the first week's data since much of
  that data will only include learning AEN and not collaborating.
\item{\em Workstation availability}: Since AEN requires an X environment
  the users must use a Workstation.  There are a limited number of
  Workstations available to the students.  Since AEN supports asynchronous
  collaboration the team members do not have to all login at the same time.
  This will reduce the effect of the lack of workstations.
\item{\em Learning to collaboration vs. Learning to collaborate strongly}:
  Most students have no experience with ``collaboration'', much less
  ``strong collaboration''.  Most have not collaborated on any project.  
\end{itemizenoindent}

%Threats to external validity jeopardize the generalization of findings from
%this study to industry practice. Three such threats are apparent: (1) The
%participants may not be representative of industry professionals; (2) The
%artifacts may not be representative of industry artifacts; and (3) The
%collaboration methods may not be representative of industry methods.
%
%All three threats are real, although that does not mean the results from
%this study will be meaningless or irrelevant to industry.  It simply means
%that external validation of the results from this study will be necessary.
%
%This study is not intended to find causal relationships in ``strong
%collaboration'', but to explore ``strong collaboration''.  This study will
%lead to a better understanding of what ``strong collaboration'' is and some
%of the factors involved in ``strong collaboration''.  Further research is
%needed to generalize the results of this study to industry. 


\section{Anticipated Results}

We anticipate that this study will provide useful new information about
``strong collaboration'', by exploring the real time communications,
physical presence, and access control aspects of ``strong
collaboration''. In addition, the study will provide new insight into how
groups of people collaboratively author documents.
%
%Either confirmation or rejection of our hypothesis will be important to the
%understanding of ``strong collaboration''.  If our hypotheses are
%confirmed, then it indicates what set of tools are needed to support
%``strong collaboration''.  If our hypotheses are rejected, then it
%contributes new support to the claim that face to face interaction is
%required for group synergy.

  people working independently.  In general, strong collaboration most often
  (though not always) occurs in non-computer mediated, face-to-face contexts
  such as a group software design session or an interactive classroom
  setting.\cite{csdl-94-20}
d48 21

%``Strong collaboration'' is synergistic process in which groups develop
%and improve an artifact.  In order to be considered ``strong
%collaboration'' the collaboration must be more efficient and more
%effective than the same group of individuals working independently.  This
%implies there is interaction among the members of the group.  This
%collaboration has many facets.  It can occur synchronously and
%asynchronously.
a69 6
Based upon this definition of ``strong collaboration'' we believe that
AEN's set of tools and features supports ``strong collaboration''.  We
hypothesize that: (a) ``strong collaboration'' will occur in AEN. (b) Real
time communications occur in ``strong collaboration''.  (c) There is a
sense of physical presence in ``strong collaboration''.  (d) Access control
is used in ``strong collaboration''.

The method for this experiment is to issue a beginning questionnaire to the
Spring 95 ICS 413 class, collect metrics data generated by both authors and
readers of the hypertext, collect bug reports and suggestions, and conduct
a user survey at the end of the experiment. the experiment will start on 24
Feb 1995 and data collection will end on 26 Mar 1995.  The data will be

broken into ?? teams.  Each team has ?? members.  Each team will develop a
software product to be used by an organization outside of the university.
Each team will develop a design document, design specifications, project
proposal, project schedule, and ....  These documents will be
collaboratively developed using AEN as the authoring tool.  With AEN's
ability to create HTML pages the teams will be able to create WWW pages
describing their projects.  Each team will use AEN to author their
documents.  The case study will monitor the teams use of AEN to create
their documents.

  In order to show that ``strong collaboration'' occurred in AEN we must
  show that the following factors were met by the groups.
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    
  \item{\em Collaboration} Members work together on the artifact.  The
    artifact is more than a collection of individual effort.  
    
  \item{\em Efficiency} Members were able to worked in parallel.
    
  \item{\em Effectiveness} Members are able to trade feedback on the
    whole artifact.

  factors occurred in AEN.

    \item{\em Collaboration:}  AEN allows several modes of collaboration:
    different members of the team can edit the same node, members of the

    annotations on the node, and members can use Partyline to comment on
    the contents of a node.

    The metrics collected will allow us to determine if any of these
    modes of collaboration occurred.  Figure \ref{example:trading}
    shows two users collaborating via trading the lock and editing the
    contents of the same node.  User 1 (cmoore) reads node 1428, then
    locks that node.  He makes changes and unlocks the node.  User 2
    (johnson) then locks the node and makes further changes.

    Figures \ref{example:commenting1} and \ref{example:commenting2}
    show two users collaborating via commenting.  User 1 (cmoore)
    starts his session by reading a node 1428 and then locked the node.
    User 1 then changes the contents of the node and unlocks the node.
    He then allows the other users read and annotation access to the
    node.  User 2 (johnson) then reads node 1428 and makes an
    annotation.  He then edits and saves the comment and gives all the
    other users read access to the comment.  After reading User 2's
    comment User 1 goes back and edits the original node.

  The questionnaires will tell us how the users felt about using AEN's
  tool.  By correlating the results of the questionnaires we will be able
  to see if the users felt the set of tools in AEN promoted collaboration.

  The feedback mechanism will tell us if the users found any problems with
  AEN that stopped them from collaborating.

\item{\em Real time communications occur in ``strong collaboration''.}

  If ``strong collaboration'' occurs we can look at the metrics data to
  see if the users used Partyline to communicate.  The metrics of the
  users who ``strongly collaborated'' will show each time they used
  Partyline.  The Partyline metrics holds a list of the other users that
  the message was sent to.  By looking at the list of other users we can
  see if they are in the group that ``strongly collaborated''.

  Figure \ref{example:realStrong} shows an example of what the metrics
  would look like for two users strongly collaborating.  Note they are
  also using Partyline to communicate in real time.

  The second questionnaire asks if the users used the Snoopy feature to get a
  sense of presence in AEN.  It also asks if AEN provides a strong sense of
  presence.  If ``strong collaboration'' occurs then the users should say
  that there is a strong sense of presence in AEN.
d326 3
a328 18
\item{\em Access control is used in ``strong collaboration''.}

  If ``strong collaboration'' occurs we can look at the metrics data to
  see if the users used the access control mechanisms.  The metrics of
  the users who ``strongly collaborated'' will show each time they
  changed the access to a node.  The access control metrics holds a list
  of the users that have access to the node.  By looking at the list of
  other users we can see if they are in the group that ``strongly
  collaborated''.

  Figure \ref{example:access} shows an example of what the metrics
  would look like for two users strongly collaborating.  Note they are
  changing the access to the nodes so that the other members can provide
  feedback on the node.

\section{Limitations and Assumptions}
d371 2
a372 1
\paragraph {Threats to Internal Validity.}
d374 4
a377 4
Threats to internal validity are factors other than the independent
variables that may affect the dependent variables and thus confound the
results.  The proposed experiment is designed to account for several
classes of threats to internal validity:
d379 2
a380 1
\begin{itemizenoindent}
d382 7
a388 5
\item {\em Selection effects} due to natural variation in human performance
  are limited by: (a) using a subject population that is relatively
  homogeneous in their collaborative authoring skills; (b) assigning
  subjects randomly to teams; (c) using a within-subjects design for the
  treatment variable.
d390 7
a396 3
\item {\em Carryover effects} due to learning from the first experimental
  trial are controlled by simply observing the behavior of the students,
  thus the carryover effect is distributed across the different groups.
d398 6
a403 4
\item {\em Replication effects} due to differences in materials,
  participants, or execution across replications are minimized by using the
  same authoring system and tools, AEN will provide a highly standardized
  environment for collaboration.
d405 16
a420 1
\end{itemizenoindent}
d422 1
a422 1
\paragraph {Threats to External Validity.}
d424 3
a426 5
Threats to external validity jeopardize the generalization of findings from
this study to industry practice. Three such threats are apparent: (1) The
participants may not be representative of industry professionals; (2) The
artifacts may not be representative of industry artifacts; and (3) The
collaboration methods may not be representative of industry methods.
d428 1
a428 3
All three threats are real, although that does not mean the results from
this study will be meaningless or irrelevant to industry.  It simply means
that external validation of the results from this study will be necessary.
d430 35
a464 5
This study is not intended to find causal relationships in ``strong
collaboration'', but to explore ``strong collaboration''.  This study will
lead to a better understanding of what ``strong collaboration'' is and some
of the factors involved in ``strong collaboration''.  Further research is
needed to generalize the results of this study to industry. 
d472 11
a482 11
collaboration''. In addition, the study will provide new insight into
how groups of people collaboratively author documents.

Either confirmation or rejection of our hypothesis will be important to the
understanding of ``strong collaboration''.  If our hypotheses are
confirmed, then it indicates what set of tools are needed to support
``strong collaboration''.  If our hypotheses are rejected, then it
contributes new support to the claim that face to face interaction is
required for group synergy.
