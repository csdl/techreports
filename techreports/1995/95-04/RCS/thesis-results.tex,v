\chapter{Study Results}
\label{sec:analysis}

This chapter presents the results from the evaluation of AEN during Spring,
1995.  Section \ref{sec:data-overview} briefly overviews the results of the
groups' usage of AEN.  Section \ref{sec:AEN-supports} presents the
evaluation of AEN's support of strong collaboration.  Section
\ref{sec:Tools} discusses the major features of AEN that were designed to
support strong collaboration.  Section \ref{sec:eval-AEN} presents the
evaluation of AEN as a collaborative tool.  Section \ref{sec:bottom-up}
closes this chapter with a brief description of the three groups'
procedures for collaboration.


\section{Overview of the Collected Data}
\label{sec:data-overview}

\small
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Statistics Summary of AEN usage.}

  \label{tab:summary}
\end{table}  
\normalsize

At the end of the study, I analyzed the database, metrics, bug reports,
user suggestions and user surveys.  Table \ref{tab:summary} provides a
summary of the statistics of the three groups.  Over the course of the
study, the three groups spent over 180 hours using AEN. They created 100
document nodes, 111 comment nodes, and 5 figure nodes.  There were large
differences in how the different groups and members used AEN.  Thirteen of
the fifteen users returned their post-test surveys.

The bug reports for Fall, 1994 were compared with the bug reports for
Spring, 1995.  I classified the bug reports into three categories, system
bugs, data corruption bugs, and user misunderstanding.  The system bugs
category describes bug reports on errors caused by AEN doing something
wrong. For example, the following is a system error bug report from the
Spring, 1995 case study.  \small
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
Description of what happened: 

I tried to quit(AEN menu) after closing the Partyline 
window but I couldn't. 

I got error message :
Error signalled by u*error system: gi*partyline, 
invalid-db-ID, recoverable
  \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\normalsize
The data corruption category is for bug reports describing an error in
the HTML data stored in a node. For example, the following is a data
corruption bug report from the
Fall, 1994 case study.
\small 
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
Description of what happened: 

Inaba's "Help by QUESTION" node under the AEN tutorial
cannot be retrieved.  (invalid link-ID).  Can you
please repair this corruption?
  \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\normalsize

The user misunderstanding category is for bug reports that describe an
error that is due to the user's misunderstanding of AEN.  For example, the
following is a data corruption bug report from the Spring, 1995 case study.
\small
\begin{quote}
  \begin{verbatim}
Description of what happened: 

I am just curious why when I type in the "less than sign" 
is gives me '&lt;' instead.  I am not able to make some html 
statements without the sign.
  \end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
\normalsize
AEN's has a menu item that allows the user to insert a $<$ character instead
of the HTML code, ``\&lt;''.

\small
\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Classification of Bug Reports.}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c||c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Bug Reports}\\ \hline

      \hline

    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:bugs}
  \end{center}
\end{table}
\normalsize
    
Table \ref{tab:bugs} shows the numbers and classification of bug reports
submitted during the two semesters.  There were seven fewer bug reports
during the Spring, 1995 use of AEN than the Fall, 1994 use.  Of the Spring,
1995 bug reports, 56\% were due to system errors.  In Fall, 1994 75\% of
the bug reports were due to system errors.  Interestingly, the number of
user misunderstandings is larger in the Spring, 1995 usage.  This may be
due to the experience difference in subjects.  In Fall, 1994, AEN was used
by graduate students and in Spring, 1995, AEN was used
by undergraduates.  %This could be due to??

This study investigated two questions. First, does AEN support strong
collaboration? Second, does AEN's set of tools promote collaboration?  The
next section discusses how well AEN supports strong collaboration.

\section{Does AEN support strong collaboration?}
\label{sec:AEN-supports}

To answer this question, each of the metrics for each component of the
operationalized definition are examined in turn.  The analysis of each
metric presents two sets of numbers, one relating to all of the nodes owned
by the group, the other focusing on the only the nodes that appear in the
group's final requirements document.  For the purpose of the this
evaluation, I will look only at the groups' document nodes, since the
comment nodes are for feedback purposes.  I do not expect collaborative
editing on a comment intended as feedback.  In order to say that AEN does
support the strongest collaboration possible, a single group must
demonstrate all four components of the operationalized definition of strong
collaboration presented in Section \ref{sec:operationalized-definition}.

\subsection{RPN: Readers per Node}

The first metric I will look at, is the readers per node (RPN) metric. For
this study, the lowest RPN value is one, indicating that no member of the
group read any nodes other than those he created.  The highest possible RPN
value is five, indicating that every member read every node.  Each group
in the study behaved differently with respect to RPN.

\subsubsection{Group A}

\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Group A RPN Metric Breakdown.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf RPN metric of Group A
      Members}\\ \hline 
      Readers/Node&All Nodes&{\%}&Final Doc Nodes&{\%}\\ \hline 
      \hline
      1&14&41.2&0&0.0\\ \hline
      2&6&17.6&4&25.0\\ \hline
      3&4&11.8&4&25.0\\ \hline
      4&3&8.8&2&12.5\\\hline 
      5&7&20.6&6&37.5\\\hline

      \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{\bf RPN}&\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Final
      Document}&\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{3.6 Readers/Node}\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:A-reading}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Table \ref{tab:A-reading} shows the RPN breakdown for Group A.  Group
A had the full range of readers per node values.  They had a fairly even
distribution of nodes with different readers per node values.  Even in the
final document, they still had a wide range of readers per node values,
unlike the other groups.  One quarter of their final document had 2 readers
per node, while 37.5\% of the nodes had five readers.  Group A's RPN
value for their final document is 3.6, the lowest RPN value for the three
groups.  However, this value is still in the top half of the RPN range.

\subsubsection{Group B}

\small
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Group B RPN Breakdown.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf RPN metric of Group B
      Members}\\  
      \hline
      Readers/Node&All Nodes&\%&Final Doc Nodes&\%\\ \hline
      \hline
      1&19&46.3&0&0.0\\ \hline
      2&1&2.4&0&0.0\\ \hline
      3&0&0.0&0&0.0\\ \hline
      4&6&14.6&3&21.4\\\hline

      \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{\bf RPN}&\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Final
      Document}&\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{4.8 Readers/Node}\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:Ku-reading}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Group B had the same range for their readers per node values as
Group A, but their distribution was very different than Group A's.  Figure
\ref{tab:Ku-reading} shows their readers per node values and RPN values.
Over 80\% of all their nodes had one or five readers per node.  In their
final document, they did not use any nodes with fewer than four readers per
node.  Their RPN value, for their final document, was 4.8.  Their RPN value
is much higher than Group A's. It is in the top 4\% of the RPN range.

\subsubsection{Group C}

\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Group C RPN Breakdown.}
  \begin{center}  
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline

      Members}\\ 
      \hline
      Readers/Node&All Nodes&\%&Final Doc Nodes&\%\\ \hline
      \hline
      1&11&44.0&0&0.0\\ \hline
      2&2&8.0&0&0.0\\ \hline
      3&0&0.0&0&0.0\\ \hline

      Readers/Node}\\ \cline{2-5} 
      \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{\bf RPN}&\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Final
      Document}&\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{5.0 Readers/Node}\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}  
  \label{tab:Na-reading}
\end{table}
\normalsize


Group C had the largest clustering of reader per node values near the
ends of the scale.  Table \ref{tab:Na-reading} shows the RPN breakdown for
Group C.  All but two of their nodes had one or five readers per node.
In their final document they only chose nodes that had five readers per
node.  They demonstrated the highest possible RPN value (5) in their final
document.


All three groups had RPN values in the top half of the RPN scale.
The next metric looks at collaborative editing of nodes. 



%\subsection{MCE: Member Co-editing}
%
%This metric focusses on the members and whether they work together.  To do
%this it looks at the collaboration from a ``group dynamic point'' of view.
%How does the group collaborate to construct the document?  The range of
%possible collaboration modes in this study range from, members only editing
%their own nodes, a score of one, to each member editing with every other
%member, a score of five.  In the strongest editing each member would have a
%MCE score of five.

%Groups B and C both had nodes that all five members worked
%on.  Therefore, each member gets an MCE value of five.  Group A was the
%only group that did not have any nodes where all five members edited.
%However, each member worked with four other members at least once in
%the other nodes.  All the groups demonstrated the strongest MCE values
%possible.
%
%After looking at the members collaborating, the next step is to look at the
%individual nodes. 


\subsection{EPN: Editors per Node}

The Editors per node (EPN) metric calculates the average number of editors
per node.  The lowest EPN value possible for this study is one, indicating
that each node was only edited by one member.  The highest possible EPN
value is five, indicating that every node was edited by all five group
members.

\subsubsection{Group A}

\small
\begin{table}[htbp]

      \hline
      1&21&61.8&3&18.8\\ \hline
      2&6&17.6&6&37.5\\ \hline

      \raisebox{1.5ex}[0pt]{\bf EPN}&\multicolumn{2}{|l|}{Final
      Document}&\multicolumn{2}{|c|}{2.7 Editors/Node}\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:A-editing}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Group A was the only group to not have a single node that had all five
members edit it.  Figure \ref{tab:A-editing} shows the EPN breakdown for
Group A.  For all the nodes that Group A created, 79\% of the nodes had
one or two editors per node.  In their final document, only 37\% of the
nodes had three or more editors per node.  Group A's EPN value of 2.7 for
their final document, is in the lower half of the EPN range.  Group A's
EPN values are the lowest of the three groups.

\subsubsection{Group B}

\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Group B EPN Breakdown.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:Ku-editing}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Group B's distribution of editors per node is very different than Group A.
Table \ref{tab:Ku-editing} shows the EPN breakdown for Group B.  Almost a
third, 29\%, of all their nodes had four or five editors per node.  In
their final requirements document, they had an EPN value of 4.3.  This
value is in the top 20\% of the EPN range.  Group B's EPN value is the
highest EPN value of all three groups.

\subsubsection{Group C}

\small
\begin{table}[htb]

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:Na-editing}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Group C also had high values for their editors per node.  Table
\ref{tab:Na-editing} shows their breakdown.  Group C's distribution of
editors per node values was very similar to Group B's.  However, for the
final document, only 70\% of their nodes had four or five editors per node.
In contrast, 86\% of Group B's nodes had four or five editors per node.
Group C's EPN value for their final document was 3.8, which is in the
upper half of the EPN range.


This section discussed one way to provide input on a node of the document ---
direct editing.  Another way to provide input is to create feedback or
comment nodes.  The next section discusses the feedback creation metric of strong
collaboration, FNC.

\subsection{FNC: Feedback Node Creation}

The Feedback Node Creation (FNC) metric in combination with EPN helps define
how much collaborative input occurred. The creation of feedback nodes gives
an indication how much discussion is going on among the authors of the
document.  FNC calculates the percentage of document nodes that have been
commented on. The lowest possible FNC value is 0\%, indicating that no
document nodes were commented on.  The highest FNC value is 100\%,
indicating that all document nodes were commented on.  
\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Feedback Nodes.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf FNC metric for

    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:feedback}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Table \ref{tab:feedback} shows the number of comment nodes and the FNC
values for each group.  Different collaboration styles can easily be seen
in the different FNC values.  Group A, with an FNC of 50\%, used comments
widely, while Group C, with an FNC of 20\%, hardly used any comments
at all. 
% These higher FNC values might explain group A's lower EPN scores

The next component of the definition is how the users control the access to
the nodes.

\subsection{NAC: Non-default Access Control}

The Non-default Access Control (NAC) metric is the first of two access
control metrics.  It calculates the percentage of nodes that have had their
access control changed from the default.  The lowest NAC value possible is
0\%, indicating that no nodes had their access control changed from the
default.  This also indicates that there was no interaction among the
members since the default access control is no access for other members.
The highest possible NAC value is 100\%, indicating that every node has had
its access control modified.

\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{NAC Breakdown.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf NAC metric by group}\\ \hline
      Group&All Nodes&NAC&Final Doc Nodes&NAC\\ \hline
      \hline
      A&26&76.5\%&16&100.0\%\\ \hline
      B&23&56.1\%&14&100.0\%\\ \hline
      C&16&64.0\%&10&100.0\%\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:access-control}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Table \ref{tab:access-control} shows the NAC values for each group.  In the
final document, 100\% of the nodes for all groups had their access control
changed.  This is not surprising.  Since all groups had RPN values for their
final documents greater than one, the access control for all those nodes
must have been changed to allow other members access to the node.  The
relatively high NAC value for A's total document implies that they
created fewer ``private'' nodes.  Private nodes are nodes whose access
control does not let any one else read or change them.

\subsection{EAC: Evolving Access Control}

The second metric dealing with access control is Evolving Access Control
(EAC). It calculates the percentage of document nodes that have had their
access control changed more than once. This metric measures the degree to
which the groups' collaboration changed. The lowest EAC value possible is
0\%, indicating that no nodes had their access control changed more than
once.  The highest possible EAC value is 100\%, indicating that all nodes
had their access control changed more than once.

\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{EAC Breakdown.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf EAC metric by group}\\ 
      \hline
      Group&All Nodes&NAC&Final Doc Nodes&NAC\\ \hline
      \hline
      A&7&21\%&7&44\%\\ \hline
      B&2&5\%&1&7\%\\ \hline
      C&2&8\%&1&10\%\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:d-access-control}
\end{table}
\normalsize

Table \ref{tab:d-access-control} shows the results for the EAC metric.  All
three groups evolved the access control for a few of their nodes.  Group
A, which so far has had the lower metric scores in RPN and EPN, greatly
out scores the other two groups in EAC.  The absolute values for EAC are
low, 44\%, 7\%, and 10\%.  However, a high score in EAC represents a
dynamic collaborative process.  I did not expect the three groups to have
very dynamic collaborative process, because of their low experience with
group collaboration and because they had never collaborated together.

\subsection{Summary}


Does AEN support strong collaboration?  In order to answer positively, at
least one group must demonstrate strong collaboration in their hypertext
document. Figure \ref{fig:op-def} shows a view of all the metrics for each
group.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=metrics.eps,width=6in}}
 \caption{Summary of Groups' Collaboration Metrics.}
 \label{fig:op-def}
\end{figure}

Since no one group had uniformly high values for their five metrics, I
cannot say that any group collaborated in a ``purely'' strong manner on their
document.  This does not mean that AEN does not support strong
collaboration. There could be some obscure interaction between the five
major features of AEN that prevents a single group from having high scores
in all five metrics, but I do not believe this is true.

The one or more of the three groups showed high values for the RPN, EPN and
NAC metrics.  For the FNC and EAC metrics, group A scored 50\% and 44\%,
indicating that they used AEN to comment on and change the collaborative
style of their document.  Based upon the high scores in RPN, EPN and NAC
and Group A's ability to demonstrate the other two components of the
operationalized definition of strong collaboration, I claim that AEN is
capable of supporting strong collaboration.

Let us look at the specific features that AEN uses to support strong
collaboration.

\section{AEN's Features}
\label{sec:Tools}

AEN's set of features was designed to support and encourage collaboration
between members.  The features were developed during the Fall, 1994 semester
and evaluated in the Spring, 1995 semester.  This section discusses the
five major features provided by AEN in support of collaboration: access
control, tables of contents, node lists, Snoopy and Partyline.


\subsection{Access Control}

As discussed above, each group used the access control mechanisms during
the case study.  I hoped the design of access control would promote
evolving access control.  In other words, the access to a node would change
over the lifetime of the node reflecting the different states of
completeness and collaboration.  AEN's access control model was a partial
success.  All the groups did use the control mechanism to restrict access
to the node, but they did not use its evolutionary nature to significantly
change their mode of collaboration.


For each of the remaining four major features, I will present the usage
data and the survey results.  The usage data will compare the number of
sessions each user had and the number of instances they used the tool (when
this information is available).  The survey results indicate the tools'
helpfulness and their frequency of use.  The survey questions (see Appendix
\ref{app:questionnaire1} and \ref{app:questionnaire2}) ask the user to rate
different aspects of AEN from a scale of one to nine, with one being poor
and nine being good.

The first two features, tables of contents and node lists, are
navigation aids that help the users find their way around the hypertext
document.  The tools should help the users get to the interesting nodes of
their documents.  The last two tools, Snoopy and Partyline, are designed to
provide a sense of physical presence in the hypertext.  Each will be
discussed in turn.

\newpage
\subsection{Context-Sensitive Table of Contents}
\footnotesize
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{TOC Creations.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|c||c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{9}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Tables of Contents}\\
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group A}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group B}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group C}\\ \hline
      Member&TOCs&Sessions&Member&TOCs&Sessions&Member&TOCs&Sessions\\ \hline
      \hline
      A1&10&7&B1&12&9&C1&11&16\\\hline 
      A2&10&10&B2&36&36&C2&38&17\\ \hline
      A3&66&49&B3&49&40&C3&17&17\\ \hline
      A4&20&18&B4&28&18&C4&14&15\\ \hline
      A5&9&9&B5&16&17&C5&25&25\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:A-TOC}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The table of contents (TOC) was the most used tool provided by AEN.  Table
\ref{tab:A-TOC} shows the number of times each user created a TOC vs. the
number of their sessions.  Since AEN does not automatically create a TOC,
the metrics show exactly how many times the users created tables of
contents.  Each group usage pattern of the TOCs is different.  Group A
created TOCs more often than the other groups.  Group C and B
are very close in their numbers.


\small
\begin{table}
  \caption{Survey Questions about Table of Contents. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Table of Contents}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      I used the Table of Contents:&8.7&0.7\\ \hline
      The Table of Contents is helpful:&8.3&1.3\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-TOC}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The survey results in Table \ref{tab:survey-TOC} show that the users felt
they used the TOC very often (8.7 out of 9, with a very small standard
deviation).  The users also thought that the TOC was a very helpful tool,
average score of 8.3.  

The next feature, node lists, complements tables of contents as a navigation
aid.

\newpage
\subsection{Node Lists}

\footnotesize
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Group A Node List Creations.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|c||c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{9}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Node Lists}\\
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group A}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group B}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group C}\\ \hline
      Member&Lists&Sessions&Member&Lists&Sessions&Member&Lists&Sessions\\ \hline
      \hline
      A1&0&7&B1&2&9&C1&36&16\\\hline 
      A2&4&10&B2&5&36&C2&30&17\\ \hline
      A3&4&49&B3&5&40&C3&7&17\\ \hline
      A4&16&18&B4&20&18&C4m&28&15\\ \hline
      A5&1&9&B5&44&17&C5&0&25\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:A-Node List}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The groups' use and feelings towards node lists vary greatly.  Some group
members did not create any node lists, while others created more node lists
than tables of contents.  Table \ref{tab:A-Node List} shows the number of
node lists each member created.


\small
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Survey Questions about Node Lists. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Node Lists}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      I used the Unread Nodes:&5.6&2.8\\\hline
      I used the Nodes by type:&4.9&2.6\\\hline
      I used the Owned Nodes:&4.1&2.2\\\hline
      Unread Nodes is helpful helpful:&6.8&2.2\\\hline
      Nodes by type is helpful:&5.3&2.2\\\hline
      Owned Nodes is helpful:&5.1&2.2\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-Nodelist}
\end{table}
\normalsize


The survey results (see Table \ref{tab:survey-Nodelist}) reflect the wide
variety in the metrics data.  The users did not feel that they had used the
node lists as much as the table of contents (Avg. 5.6 vs. Avg. 8.7).  The
metrics data shows that some users created more node lists than TOCs.  The
standard deviations of the node list surveys show this large variation.
The users thought that the Unread Nodes list was almost as helpful as the
TOC (Avg. 6.8 vs. Avg. 8.3).



The last two features, Snoopy and Partyline were designed to promote
collaboration in AEN.  They are discussed next.

\subsection{Snoopy}

\small
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Survey Questions about Snoopy. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Snoopy}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      I used Snoopy:&6.3&2.6\\\hline
      Snoopy is helpful:&6.8&2.4\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-Snoopy}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The Snoopy feature is started with each AEN session.  To use the tool, the
user simply looks at a window that displays the usage information of all
users.  Thus there were no meaningful metrics collected about Snoopy.  The
survey results (see Table \ref{tab:survey-Snoopy}) show that the users
generally used and liked Snoopy.  The large standard deviation might be
attributed to the different user's method of collaboration.  Snoopy's
information is not very interesting if there are no other users logged in
or if the other members are present and accessible in the room.


The last feature evaluated in AEN is Partyline.
\subsection{Partyline} 

\footnotesize
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Partyline Messages.}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|c||c|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{9}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Partyline Messages}\\
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group A}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c||}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group B}&
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Group C}\\ \hline
      Member&Msgs.&Sessions&Member&Msgs.&Sessions&Member&Msgs.&Sessions\\ \hline
      \hline
      A1&0&7&B1&0&9&C1&1&16\\\hline 
      A2&0&10&B2&47&36&C2&0&17\\ \hline
      A3&53&49&B3&154&40&C3&10&17\\ \hline

      A5&41&9&B5&0&17&C5&15&25\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:A-Partyline}
\end{table}
\normalsize


The metrics for Partyline use (see Table \ref{tab:A-Partyline}) show
that there is a wide variety in the number of Partyline messages sent.
Two users, A4 and B3, have 62.3\% of all the Partyline messages
sent.  Comparing the times Partyline messages were sent and when users
were simultaneously editing node, it does not appear that Partyline was
used more than 15 times to coordinate editing.

\small
\begin{table}
  \caption{Survey Questions about Partyline. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Partyline}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      I used Partyline:&5.2&2.6\\\hline
      Partyline is helpful helpful:&6.2&2.4\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-Partyline}
\end{table}
\normalsize

One possible reason for this low use of Partyline is referenced in the
limitations section of the experimental design.  The users could only
access AEN from two rooms.  This meant that they were frequently co-located
in the same room, and thus able to speak directly to each other instead of
using Partyline.  Since it is easier talk than type, I believe they
collaborated verbally instead of using Partyline.  This could lead to the
low score for Partyline use in the survey.  Table
\ref{tab:survey-Partyline} shows the results of the survey for Partyline.
The users felt that Partyline was fairly helpful even though the did not
use it very often.


\small
\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Survey Question about Sense of Presence. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Sense of Presence}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      AEN provides a sense of:&6.5&1.9\\
      physical presence for&&\\
      the other users.&&\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-Presence}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The above two features are designed to promote a sense of physical presence
for each of the users.  The survey asked the users about their sense of
physical presence.  Table \ref{tab:survey-Presence} shows the results of
the sense of presence survey question.  They felt that AEN does provide a
sense of physical presence for the other users.

\section{Evaluation of AEN}
\label{sec:eval-AEN}

The evaluation of the set of features provided by AEN shows that they
generally were used and liked by the group members.  There was a wide
variation in the feelings of the group members and different features were
used to different degrees.  A goal of this research is to evaluate AEN as a
collaborative editing tool.

There are three different sets of evidence that lead me to believe AEN is a
successful collaborative tool. One, all three groups collaboratively
created quality requirements documents. Two groups received an A on their
document and one received a B.  Two, all three requirements documents show
high values in at least three of their collaborative metrics.  Three, the
survey results show that the users liked AEN.  Table \ref{tab:survey-AEN}
shows the results of the survey questions about AEN.

\small
\begin{table}[htb]
  \caption{Survey Questions about AEN. (Scale 1 to 9)}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}
      \hline
      \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\rule[-3mm]{0mm}{8mm}\bf Survey Questions:
      Overall reactions to AEN:}\\ \hline
      &Average&Std. Dev.\\ \hline
      terrible---wonderful&5.5&1.6\\\hline
      frustrating---satisfying&5.0&1.8\\\hline
      dull---stimulating&5.0&1.7\\\hline
      difficult---easy&6.2&1.9\\\hline
      rigid---flexible&5.2&1.9\\\hline\hline
      AEN promotes collaboration:&7.2&2.0\\\hline
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  \label{tab:survey-AEN}
\end{table}
\normalsize

The users felt that AEN promoted collaboration, but there was disagreement
about that.  One user did not think AEN promoted collaboration.  That user
rated AEN a two out of nine.

AEN as a system supports collaboration, but what kinds of collaboration
occurred during the study?  The next section discusses some of the styles
each group displayed during the study.

\section{Three Examples of Strong Collaboration}
\label{sec:bottom-up}

Each of the three groups had their own collaborative style.  Two groups
defined their processes in their AEN workspace.  One group divided up the
work and used a style with lower EPN and RPN metrics.  A second group's
style has high EPN and RPN metrics.  The next three sections briefly
discusses each of the three group's collaborative styles.

\subsection{Group A}

Group A used the style with the lowest EPN and RPN metrics of the three groups.
They produced their own custom process model for collaboration.  One node
discusses this process and is reproduced here:
\begin{quote}
  {\em
  We need to develop some sort of an operating instruction to more
  effectively use AEN.  some difficulties that we have experienced so far
  have included:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item{Multiple users at one time - confusion exists, collaboration
    breaks down.}
  \item{Review of documents and updating - how and who}
  \item{Do we give write access to everyone in the group? then, who controls
    the node?}
  \end{enumerate}
    
  Suggestions to improve:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \item{Every node created should be given write access by two individuals.
  The person who created the node and another.  Thus, there should be a
  primary author and a secondary author.}
  \item{Every member must be given read and annotate access!}
  \end{enumerate}}
\end{quote}

I believe this policy led to their low number of readers and authors per
node as compared to the other groups.  Their policy tends to be a divide
and conquer process.  Not allowing all five member write access
automatically reduces the number of authors.  This low number of authors
also explains why their FNC metric was so high.  Since each node only has
two authors, the other three members must use commenting to provide input
to the node.

Group A was not the only group with a defined process.  The other group
that defined a process in their workspace was Group B.

\subsection{Group B}

Group B created a node where they would put any comments to the other
members.  In this node they outlined their process for using AEN:
\begin{quote}
  {\em
  Please make nodes that you have created, not only readable, but also
  writable to other group members, at least annotation rights so that we
  comment on what you have done.  Due to the fact that we have a lot of
  work that should be done on AEN, I would like us to eventually put most
  of our questions, comments and work surrounding the project in AEN.
  }
\end{quote}

The instructions to make all nodes readable and writable to the other group
members leads to their high number of nodes with five editors.

\subsection{Group C}

The last group, C did not publish their process.  I believe that their lack
of a published process leads to their median results between Group A and
Group B with respect to EPN.  They did not have a process that restricted
the number of authors nor promoted having all five members author the
nodes.

Since no one group had uniformly high values for their five metrics, we
cannot say that any group strongly collaborated on their document.  This
does not mean that AEN does not support strong collaboration. There could
be some obscure interaction between the five major features of AEN that
prevents a single group from having high scores in all five metrics, but we
do not believe this is true.

the case study.  We hoped the design of access control would
promote evolving access control.  In other words, the access to a node would change over
the lifetime of the node reflecting the different states of completeness
and collaboration.  AEN's access control model was a partial success.  All
the groups did use the control mechanism to restrict access to the node,
but they did not use its evolutionary nature to significantly change their
mode of collaboration.

At the end of the study, we analyzed the database, metrics, and user
surveys.  Table \ref{tab:summary} provides a summary of the statistics of
the three groups.  Over the course of the study, the three groups spent
over 180 hours using AEN. They created 100 document nodes, 111 comment nodes,
and 5 figure nodes.  There were also large differences in how the
different groups and members used AEN.  Thirteen of the fifteen users
returned their end of study surveys.

To answer this question, each of the metrics for each operationalized
definition are examined in turn.  The analysis of each metric presents two
sets of numbers, one relating to all of the nodes owned by the group, the
other focusing on the only the nodes that appear in the final requirements
document.
a168 4
The first step in determining if strong collaboration has occurred is to
look at RPN metric.  For the purpose of the groups' requirements we will
look only at the groups' document nodes, since the comment nodes are for
feedback purposes.
d170 1
d173 6
a178 9
In order to detect strong collaboration, we first looked the reading
patterns of the group members.  In weak collaboration, each member of the
group only works on their own part of the artifact.  Since they deal only
with their nodes, they do not read the other members' nodes.  In the
strongest collaboration possible, all the members work on all the nodes of
the artifact.  In order to work on all the nodes, all the members must read
all the nodes.  The range of the RPN metric in this study is from weak
collaboration, a single reader per node, to the strongest RPN, five readers
per node.

%A single reader of a node indicates that only the author read

Table \ref{tab:Koa-reading} shows the results for group Koa.  The members
of group Koa evenly read the nodes.  Group Koa had the full range of RPN
values.  They had a fairly even distribution of nodes with different RPN
values.  Even in the final document, they still had a wide range of RPN
values.  One quarter of their final document had a RPN value of 2, while
37.5\% of the nodes an RPN value of five.  Group Koa demonstrates the
lowest average RPN value for their final document.  However, this
collaboration in numbers of readers per node.  However, their average RPN
score for their final document was 3.62.  This score is in the top half of
the RPN scale.

Group Ku Kahakai had the same range for their RPN values as group Koa, but
their distribution was very different than Koa's.  Figure
\ref{tab:Ku-reading} shows their RPN values.  Their RPN values tended to
cluster near the ends of the scale.  There were many nodes with an RPN of
one or five.  In their final document they did not use any nodes with an
RPN of less than four.  Their average RPN value, for their final document,
was 4.79.  Their RPN average is much higher than Koa's.

\subsection{MCE: Member Co-editing}
a409 7
This metric focusses on the members and whether they work together.  To do
this it looks at the collaboration from a ``group dynamic point'' of view.
How does the group collaborate to construct the artifact?  The range of
possible collaboration modes range from, members only editing their own
nodes, a score of one, to each member editing with every other member, a
score of five.  In the strongest editing each member would have a MCE score
of five.

Groups Ku Kahakai and Na Koa both had nodes that all five members worked
on.  Therefore, each member gets an MCE value of five.  Group Koa was the
only group that did not have any nodes where all five members edited.
However, each member worked with four other members at least once in
the other nodes.  All the groups demonstrated the strongest MCE values
possible.
a419 17
After looking at the members collaborating, the next step is to look at the
nodes.  The next section looks at editors per node.


\subsection{EPN: Editors per Node}

This metric focusses on how many members edited each node.  Is each node of
the artifact worked on collaboratively?  Each node of the artifact can be
developed differently.  Some nodes can be developed in a weakly
collaborative nature, i.e., only one author creates it, an EPN score of
one.  Other nodes can be developed in a strongly collaborative nature,
i.e., all the members help create the node, an EPN score of five.  To
determine the EPN score for each node, the number of different members to
edit the node was counted.  Changing the contents or annotating a node was
considered editing that node.  Each group showed different patterns in
their documents.

As mentioned in the previous section, group Koa was the only group to not
have a node that had all five members edit it.  Figure
\ref{tab:Koa-editing} shows the EPN results.  For all the
nodes that group Koa created, 79\% of the nodes had an EPN score of one or two.
This is low on the EPN scale.  In the final document, only 37\% of the nodes
had an EPN value of three or higher.  Group Koa's average EPN value of
2.38, in the lower half of the EPN scale.  Group Koa's average EPN value is
the lowest of the three groups.

four or five.  In their final requirements document, they had an EPN

Group Na Koa also had high values for their EPN metric.  Table

values was very similar to Ku Kahakai's.  However, for the final document,
their distribution is more spread out.  Only 70\% of their nodes had an EPN
value of four or five.  In contrast, 86\% of Ku Kahakai's nodes had an EPN
value of four or five.  Group Na Koa's average EPN value was 3.8, in the
upper half of the EPN scale.

The previous two sections discussed one way to provide input on a node of
the artifact, direct editing.  Another way is to create feedback or comment
nodes.  The next section discusses the next metric of strong collaboration,
FNC.
d519 5
d526 7
a532 8
This metric in combination with MCE and EPN help define how much
collaborative input occurred.  The creation of feedback nodes gives an
indication how much discussion is going on among the authors/creators of
the node.  In pure weak collaboration, no feedback nodes would be created.
The FNC metric is a ratio of comment nodes to document nodes.  
%Pure strong collaboration on the other hand would have all members creating
%feedback about each node.

at all.

This access control metric is the simpler of the two access control
metrics.  It measures how much the members manipulate the access control
of the nodes.  All nodes in AEN start out with a default access control.
The default access control only allows the creator of the node read, write,
and annotation access.  No other member has access to the new node.  The
NAC metric measures how many nodes had their access control changed from
the default.

Table \ref{tab:access-control} shows the NAC values for each group.  There
were no nodes that were read by more than one member without a change to
its access control.  This implies that the nodes that did not have any
access control were never intended for ``public'' release.  In the final
document 100\% of the nodes for all groups had their access control
changed.
d603 7
a609 5
The second metric dealing with access control is EAC.  It measures how much
the access control of a node changes over time.  Changing the access
control changes the mode of collaboration allowed for that node.  If this
occurs then we can say that the members thought about how they want to
collaborate on the node.

In each of the six metrics a group or groups showed very high scores.
Figure \ref{fig:op-def} shows a scaled view of all the metrics for each
group.  For the RPN metric, group Na Koa had an RPN value of 100 for all of
their nodes.  For MCE, all three groups had values of five.  For EPN, group
Ku Kahakai had an average of 4.29, with six nodes with a five EPN value.
For FNC, group Koa had a value of 1.79.  For NAC, all three groups had
values of 100\%.  For EAC, group Koa had a value of 43.8\%.

Just by looking at the fact that there was at least high value each metric,
one might say that AEN supports strong collaboration.  However, this is not
necessarily true.  Just because there was one high value for each metric,
we did not see the same group score high in each metric.  Group Koa did not
have a high RPN or EPN.  Groups Ku Kahakai and Na Koa did not have a high
FNCs or EACs.  There could be an underlying reason why no one group did not
have all high metrics values.  We do not believe this is true, but there
could be some obscure interaction between the five major feature of AEN
that does not permit any group from having high values in all six metric.
So, we will say AEN is capable of supporting strong collaboration.

looking at the fact that there was at least high value each metric, one
might say that AEN supports strong collaboration.  However, this is not

At the end of the study the database, metrics, and user surveys were
analyzed.  Figure \ref{fig:summary} provides a summary of the statistics of
the three groups.  Over the course of the study the three groups had spend
over 180 hours using AEN. There were 100 document nodes, 111 comment nodes,
and 5 figure nodes created.  There was large differences in how the

The purpose of the study was to answer two questions, does AEN support
strong collaboration? and does AEN's set of tools promote collaboration.  If
AEN supports collaboration, the study would give us three example of strong
collaboration.  The next section examines the first question about how well
AEN supports strong collaboration.
d80 5
a84 5
To answer this question each of the operationalizations of strong
collaboration are examined in turn.  The analysis of each
operationalization will present the two sets of numbers, one relating to
all of the nodes owned by the group, the other focusing on the only the
nodes that appear in the final requirements document.
d87 3
a89 4
look at the number of readers per portion of the artifact.  In AEN the
portions of the artifact are the individual document or comment nodes.  For
the purpose of the groups' requirements we will look only at the groups'
document nodes, since the comment nodes are for feedback purposes.

\subsection*{Members read each other's nodes.}

In order to detect strong collaboration the reading patterns of the group
members should be looked at.  In weak collaboration each member of the
d96 6
a101 8
with their portion, they do not read the other members' portions.  In
totally strong collaboration all the members work on all the portions of
the artifact.  Therefore all the members must read all the portions of the
artifact to work on them.  The range of outcomes results of our study is
from weak collaboration, a single reader of a node.  A single reader of a
node indicates that only the author read worked on the node.  The other end
of the spectrum is that all five member read the same node.  I use the term
Reading patterns to refer to the number of readers per node in AEN.

Each of the groups in the study showed different behaviors.  They are
discussed in turn.  Figure \ref{fig:Koa-reading} shows the results for
group Koa.  The members of group Koa evenly read the nodes.  Group Koa had
a wide range of number of readers per node.  There was a fairly even
distribution of nodes with different numbers of readers.  Even in the final
document, they still had a wide range of numbers of readers per node.  25\%
of the nodes had only two readers, while 37.5\% of the nodes had five
readers.  Group Koa demonstrates the least amount of strong collaboration
in numbers of readers per node.  However, they still had 37.5\% of their
final document that was strongly collaborated on.

Group Ku Kahakai had the same range of distribution of number of readers
per node as group Koa, but theirs was very different than Koa's.  Figure
\ref{fig:Ku-reading} shows their reading patterns.  Over the total number
of nodes created by Ku Kahakai they tended to cluster near the ends.  There
were many nodes with only one reader or five readers.  In their final
document they did not use any nodes with fewer than four readers.  In fact,
78.6\% of their final document had five readers.  They were much more
strongly collaborative in their readers per node than group Koa.

Group Na Koa had the widest difference in the number of readers per node.
Figure \ref{fig:Na-reading} shows the results for group Na Koa.  92\% of
all the node they created either had five readers or one reader.  In their
final document they only chose nodes that had five readers.  They
demonstrate pure strong collaboration in their readers per node for their
final document.

After looking at the number of readers per portion the next step to
determine if strong collaboration has occurred is to look at the amount of
collaborative editing that occurs.  The next two sections investigate the
type of editing that occurs for each node and member.  They are very
similar.  The distinction between them is their focus, one looks at editing
from the point of view of the member, while the other, takes the point of
view of the nodes.

\subsection*{Members edit nodes that were also edited by others.}
d208 11
a218 6
This operationalization focusses on the members working with each other.
It looks at the collaboration from a group dynamic point of view.  How does
the group collaborate to construct the artifact.  The range of possible
collaboration modes range from, members do not interact to all members
interact with all other members.  In strong collaboration each member works
with the other members to create the portions of the document.

on.  Therefore each member worked with all the other members of the group.
Group Koa is the only group that did not have a single node where all five
members edited the node.  However, each member worked with the other four
members at least once in the other nodes.  All the group demonstrate strong
collaboration with respect to members editing nodes that other members
edited.

a277 10
This operationalization focusses on the artifact's point of view.  Is the
division of the artifact worked on collaboratively.  Each portion of the
artifact can be developed differently.  Some portions can be developed in a
weakly collaborative nature, i.e. only one author creates it.  Other
portions can be developed in a strongly collaborative nature, i.e. all the
members help create the portion.  To determine the method of collaboration
for each portion, the number of different members to edit the node was
counted.  Changing the contents or annotating a node was considered editing
that node.  Each group showed different patterns in their documents, and is
discussed in turn.

\ref{fig:Koa-editing} shows the number of editors per node.  For all the
nodes that group Koa created 79\% of the nodes had only one or two editors.
This is weakly collaborative.  In the final document only 37\% of the nodes
were edited by three or four members.  The fact that there were nodes with
four editors shows that group Koa did strongly collaborate on some nodes,
but overall their document is the least strongly collaborative of the three
groups.

The next group Ku Kahakai edited their nodes much differently than Koa.
Figure \ref{fig:Ku-editing} shows the results for group Ku Kahakai.  29\%
of the total nodes were edited by four or five authors.  Ku Kahakai used a
stronger collaborative method to create their document.  In the final
requirements document 100\% of the nodes were edited by three, four or five
members.  This is the strongest editing collaboration that any of the
groups demonstrated.

Group Na Koa also showed strong editing collaboration in many of their
nodes.  Figure \ref{fig:Na-editing} shows their results.  Na Koa's
distribution of number of editors per node for all their nodes is very
similar to Ku Kahakai's.  However, when the final document is looked at,
their distribution is more spread out.  Only 70\% of their nodes are edited
by four or five members.  While 86\% of Ku Kahakai's nodes were edited by
four or five members.
d366 4
a369 6
The previous two section discussed one method of providing input to a
portion of the artifact, direct editing.  Another method to provide input
to the portion of the artifact is to create feedback or comment on the
artifact.  AEN allows members to create comment nodes to provide this input
to the artifact.  The next section discusses the next operationalization of
strong collaboration, the creation of feedback.
d371 1
a371 1
\subsection*{Members create feedback nodes.}
d373 7
a379 6
This operationalization in combination with the previous two helps define
how much collaborative input occurred.  The creation of feedback nodes
gives an indication how much discussion is going on among the
authors/creators of the portion.  In pure weak collaboration no feedback
nodes would be created.  Pure strong collaboration on the other hand would
have all members creating feedback about each portion.

Figure \ref{fig:feedback} shows the number of annotations and comment nodes
created by each group.  Each comment counts as an annotation.  Annotations
that are not comments are document nodes that further explore an issue
raised in the base node.  Different collaboration styles can easily be seen
in the different numbers of comments created.  Group Koa used comments
widely while Na Koa hardly used any comments at all.

a409 2
\subsection*{Members manipulate access control to publish/protect artifacts
under development.}
d411 7
a417 11
The access control operationalization is probably the most complex
operationalization of strong collaboration.  There are two parts to this
operationalization.  First, did the members manipulate the access control
of the nodes? Second, did they dynamically change the access control for
the node during the life of the node?  If the first part occurs then we can
say that the members thought about how they want to collaborate on the
node.  The member who manipulated the access control decided to allow
different members access to the node, thus defining who could do what.  The
second part of this operationalization is an indication that the node has
changed in some way and that the original collaborative scheme needs to be
changed to allow a new mode of collaboration on the node.

Figure \ref{fig:access-control} shows the data for each group that answers
the first part of this operationalization.  There were no nodes that were
read by more than one member without a change to its access control.  This
implies that the nodes that did not have any access control were never
intended for ``public'' release.  In the final document 100\% of the nodes
for all groups had their access control changed.

Figure \ref{fig:d-access-control} shows the results for the second part of
access control.  All three groups did dynamically change the access control
on some of their nodes.  Group Koa which so far has had the lower scores
for the other operationalizations greatly out scores the other two groups
in this one.
d520 3
a522 4
Based upon the above discussions of the operationalizations of strong
collaboration, AEN does support strong collaboration.  Each group shows
evidence of each operationalization.  Therefore AEN supports strong
collaboration. 
d524 1
a524 4
Now that we know that AEN can support strong collaboration, let us look at
the specific tools that AEN uses to support strong collaboration.

\section{AEN's Features.}
d527 5
a531 4
AEN's set of features was designed to support and encourage collaboration
between members.  The set of features were developed over the Fall semester
and evaluated in the case study.  The first feature is not a tool it is the
access control model that AEN uses.
d534 1
a534 1
\subsection*{Access Control}
d536 8
a543 8
As discussed above each group did use the access control mechanisms to
control the access to the nodes.  We hoped with the design of the access
control model to promote dynamic access control.  The access to a node
would change over the life time of the node reflecting the different states
of completeness and different collaboration.  AEN's access control model
was a partial success.  All the groups did use the control mechanism to
restrict access to the node, but they did not use its dynamic nature to 
change their mode of collaboration significantly. 
d550 8
a557 7
For the following tools I will present the usage data and the survey
results.  The usage data will compare the number of sessions each user had
and the number of instances they used the tool (when this information is
available).  The survey results rank the tools helpfulness and their use by
the users.  The survey questions (see appendix \ref{app:questionnaire1}
and \ref{app:questionnaire2}) ask the user to rate different aspects of AEN
from a scale of one to nine, with one being poor and nine being good.
d559 4
a562 4
The first two tools, tables of contents and node lists, are navigation aids
that help the users find their way around the hypertext document.  The
tools should help the users get to the interesting portions of their
documents.  The last two tools, Snoopy and Partyline, are designed to

\subsection*{Context-sensitive table of contents}

The table of contents (TOC) was the most used tool provided by AEN.
Figures \ref{fig:Koa-TOC}, \ref{fig:Ku-TOC}, and \ref{fig:Na-TOC} show the
number of times each user created a TOC vs. the number of their sessions.
Since AEN does not automatically create a TOC, the metrics show exactly how
many times the users created tables of contents.  Each group usage pattern
of the TOCs is different.  Group Koa created TOCs more often than the other
groups.  Group Na Koa and Ku Kahakai are very close in their numbers.

The survey results in Figure \ref{fig:survey-TOC} show that the users felt
they used the TOC very often 8.7 out of 9 with a very small standard
deviation.  The users also thought that the TOC was a very helpful tool,
average score of 8.3.  There was less agreement between the users about it
helpfulness, however.  This is a reflection of the variation in the
use of the TOC that the metrics demonstrate.

The next tool, node lists, complement tables of contents as the primary
navigation aids.

\subsection*{Node Lists}

The groups' use and feelings towards node lists vary greatly.  Some group
members did not create any node lists, while others created more node lists
than tables of contents.  Figures \ref{fig:Koa-Node List}, \ref{fig:Ku-Node
List}, and \ref{fig:Na-Node List} show the number of node lists each member
created.

The survey results (see Figure \ref{fig:survey-Nodelist}) reflect the wide

node lists as much as the table of contents (Avg. 5.6 vs. Avg. 8.7).  When the
metrics data shows that some users created more node lists than TOCs.  The
standard deviations of the node list surveys show this huge variation.  The
users thought that the Unread Nodes list was almost as helpful as the TOC
(Avg. 6.8 vs. Avg. 8.3).

The metrics for Partyline use, see Figures \ref{fig:Koa-Partyline},
\ref{fig:Ku-Partyline}, and \ref{fig:Na-Partyline}, show that there is a
wide variety in the number of Partyline messages sent.  Two users mching
and rsato have 62.3\% of all the Partyline messages sent.  Comparing the
times Partyline messages were sent and when users were simultaneously
editing node, it does not appear that Partyline was used more than 15 times
to coordinate editing.

One reason for this low use of Partyline is referenced in the limitations
section of the experimental design.  The users could access AEN from only
two rooms.  This allowed them to talk to each other instead of using
Partyline.  Being able to talk to each other leads to the low score for use
of Partyline in the survey.  Figure \ref{fig:survey-Partyline} shows the
results of the survey for Partyline.  The users felt that Partyline was
fairly helpful even though the did not use it very often.

An important goal of this study was to evaluate AEN as a collaborative
tool.  There are three different sets of measurements that show that AEN is
a successful collaborative tool:  one, all three groups collaboratively
created quality requirements documents;  two, all three requirements
documents show strong collaboration; and three, the survey results show
that the user's liked AEN.  Figure \ref{fig:survey-AEN} shows the results
of the survey questions about AEN.

strongly collaborated on almost every node in their final document.  The
next three sections briefly introduce the three groups unique styles.

Group Koa used the most weakly collaborative style of the three groups.
They produced their own internal process to be used to collaborate.  Their

I believe this policy lead to their low number of readers and authors per
node as compared to the other groups.  This policy tends to be a divide and
conquer process.  Not allowing all five member write access automatically
reduces the number of authors.  This low number of authors also explains
why they had so many comment.  Commenting is their only way to provide
input to nodes that they are not authors of.

The other group that had a process defined in their workspace was Ku
Kahakai.  Ku Kahakai created a node where they would put any comments to
the other members.  In this node they outlined their process for using AEN.

authors nor promoted having all five members author the nodes.
