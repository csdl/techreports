\abstract{

With the increased use of hypertext, the issues behind collaborative
authoring of hypertext are becoming more important.  This thesis presents
the Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN), a system designed to support {\em
strong collaboration} among a group as they cooperatively build, review,
revise, improve and learn from a structured hypertext document.  AEN
addresses how strong collaboration can be supported through computer
mediation.  It is designed to support collaborative creation of hypertext
and to instrument the actions of its users in order to understand how such
creation occurs.

During Fall, 1994, AEN was used for a graduate seminar on collaborative
systems.  In Spring, 1995, I conducted a case study to evaluate AEN's
support of {\em strong collaboration}.  The evaluation shows that no single
group demonstrated pure strong collaboration.  However, the evaluation also
shows that strong collaboration can be supported through computer
mediation.

%         well as artifacts should be visible; (2) Provide direct
%         and indirect authoring mechanisms; (3) Provide
%         context-sensitive change information; (4) Provide access
%         to intermediate work products; (5) Maintain database
%         integrity; (6) An agent-based architecture may be
%         necessary for systems supporting strong collaboration;
%         and (7) The WWW is not effective for strong
%         collaboration.

AEN was evaluated over from September, 1994 to May, 1995. During Fall,
1994, it was used as the central instructional and research system for a
graduate seminar on collaborative systems at the University of Hawaii.  In
Spring, 1995 we conducted a case study to evaluate AEN's support of {\em
strong collaboration}.  AEN's total usage was over 180 hours and over 256
nodes and links were created.  The evaluation shows that strong
collaboration can be supported through computer mediation.
