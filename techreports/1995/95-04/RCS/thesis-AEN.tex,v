\chapter{AEN: A Collaborative Hypertext Authoring Tool}
\label{sec:AEN}

AEN is a collaborative hypertext authoring tool designed to support and
explore the nature of strong collaboration.  This chapter provides an
overview of the design and implementation of AEN.  Section
\ref{sec:architectureAEN} describes the general architecture of AEN.
Section \ref{sec:designAEN} discusses the design of AEN and how its tools
help support strong collaboration.  The final section provides a brief
discussion of the development of AEN and its current status.

\section{Architecture of AEN}
\label{sec:architectureAEN}

AEN is a collaborative, instrumented learning/authoring tool implemented
with the Egret collaborative system development
environment\cite{csdl-93-09}.  As with all Egret domain-specific
applications, AEN is a client-server system running over TCP/IP, where
clients (implemented as customized versions of XEmacs) interact with a
central server called HBS (implemented in C++) to store and retrieve
information or communicate with other clients.  AEN makes substantial use
of Egret's facilities for agents, or autonomous client processes that
extend the system's information processing capabilities beyond those
provided by HBS or the clients.  Figure \ref{fig:aen-architecture}
illustrates AEN's basic client-server architecture.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=client-server.eps,width=5in}} 
  {\ls{1.0}{\em AEN consists of a central server called HBS that provides basic
  storage and concurrency control mechanisms, augmented with several agent
  processes to support strong collaboration.}}

\section{The design of AEN}
\label{sec:designAEN}
\subsection{Structure of Data in AEN}

AEN provides facilities for storage, retrieval, and analysis of a hypertext
network of node and links. The hypertext network represents the text from
which the students learn and the product of collaboration among the
participants.  AEN provides a static, predefined set of node and link
types.

\subsubsection{Node Types}

At the user-level, AEN provides two type hierarchies of nodes: artifact
nodes and figure nodes.  Nodes of type {\em artifact} represent textual
information in the hypertext document.  Nodes of type {\em figure}
represent graphical information.

Artifact nodes contain ETML\footnote{A primary difference between the Egret
Text Markup Language (ETML) and HTML is that ETML supports {\tt egret::}
URL specifier for link and node objects within an HBS server.} code that
provides formating directives and inter-node links.  There are four
subclasses of artifacts:

\begin{itemize}

\item{\bf Document:} Nodes that contain the text of the document created by
the participants.

\item{\bf Comment:} Nodes containing the reactions of the participants to
the contents of other nodes.

\item{\bf Quicky Quiz:} Nodes that contain exercises for the participants
to complete.

\item{\bf Quicky Quiz Answer:} Nodes that contain the participant's
solutions to the quicky quiz nodes.

\end{itemize}

Quicky Quiz and Quicky Quiz Answer nodes are used in AEN to support
learning.  They can be ignored for collaborative authoring.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centerline{\psfig{figure=Data.eps,width=5in}}
  \caption{Data Relationships in AEN}
  \label{fig:Data}
\end{figure}

Unlike artifact nodes, figure nodes contain the graphics data used by Xview
to display the figures.  Users can create links from artifact nodes to
figure nodes or other artifact nodes by a simple menu-based command.  Such
an operation results in both the creation of a new link object within the
server and the creation of an ETML link anchor as part of the contents of
the artifact node.  However, since figure nodes contain graphical
information, compatible with Xview, rather than ETML code, users cannot
create links from figure nodes.  Figure \ref{fig:Data} shows the
relationships between the node types.

\subsubsection{Link Types}

AEN defines six types of links: Include, Xref,
see\_Quicky\_\-Quiz, see\_\-Quicky\_\-Quiz\_\-Answer, see\_\-Comment, and
see\_Figure.  AEN restricts the type of the source and destination nodes
for each type of link. Table 2.1 describes the different
links.  The different types of links allows the authors to create different
structures in the hypertext document. 

\begin{table}
  \begin{center}
    \caption{Link Types}
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}

      See\_Figure&Any&Figure&Points to a Figure\\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:types}
  \end{center}
\end{table}


\subsubsection{The AEN Backbone}
\label{sec:aen-backbone}

Given the set of node and link types in AEN, there are many possible ways
to organize the resulting hypertext network.  However, given the intended
usage of AEN, it is natural and appropriate to provide a fundamental
organization of the hypertext as an ordered sequence of interlinked,
hypertext ``chapters'', each hypertext chapter having as its root a single
document node.

Each document node with a link to it from a chapter node represents a
``section'' within that chapter. In the same manner, each document node
with a link to it from a section node represents a subsection within that
section, and so forth ad infinitum.

Any document node can, of course, have a link to it from more than one
other document node in the hypertext, with the result that the same node
can be a ``section'' with respect to one node, but a ``sub-subsection''
with respect to another.  As a result, the AEN hypertext is organized as a
directed, hierarchical, but potentially cyclic graph structure.

So far, this description seems to indicate that there is a one-to-one
correspondence between each document node and each chapter, section,
subsection, and so forth in the document.  The reality is slightly more
complex.  Each document node does contribute at least one new chapter, or
section, or subsection, etc. to the hypertext.  However, if a document
node contains the HTML {\em heading} formatting directive, then the label for
this heading indicates a new section (or subsection, etc. depending upon
context) within the node.

To bootstrap this organization, some distinguished ``root'' document node
is required, which I call the AEN Backbone.  This node contains a set of
links to document nodes which define the set of top-level chapters in AEN.

The AEN Backbone and the nested structure of document nodes defines the
major organizing principle for the AEN hypertext, and leads to the first
data manipulation tool: the table of contents screen, as shown in Figure
\ref{fig:Screen1}.  The next section discusses the table of contents screen
and the other data manipulation tools. 



\begin{figure}[htb]

 {\ls{1.0}{\em This screen shot shows a portion of this 
 user's table of contents in the upper left screen, and a retrieved
 document node called ``Design'' in the upper right screen.  The Design
 node contains within it both a link to a figure called ``Figure 1'' and a
 comment called ``Regions'' immediately after it (represented in the
 Design node by the textual anchor ``[??]''.  Both the figure and the
 comment are retrieved and displayed in the screens in the lower left and
 lower right hand corners, respectively.}}
 \caption{Screen Shot of AEN's Main display, a comment node, a figure node,
 and TOC.}
 \label{fig:Screen1}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Mechanisms for Data Manipulation in AEN}
\label{sec:mechanisms}

For browsing, AEN emulates many of the facilities of WWW browsers such as
Mosaic or Netscape.  Each node is displayed in a separate screen, and
multiple nodes can be displayed simultaneously.  The contents of nodes are
automatically reflowed to conform to the size of the screen.
Middle-clicking over a link anchor retrieves the corresponding node from
the server.  As noted above, AEN supports storage and retrieval of both
text and graphics, and although audio is not currently available in AEN, it
has been implemented in other Egret-based applications, and could be easily
added.  Due to a limitation in the current release of XEmacs, in-line
graphics are not currently available in AEN.

Where AEN begins to depart from WWW systems is in its support for
authoring and collaboration.  First, AEN provides an authoring mode
for nodes, including menu and command key-based formatting directives
for headings, lists, and fontification, link anchor creation, and so
forth.  Second, all artifact nodes must be locked before they can be
modified.  Locking preserves the integrity of information when
multiple authors are working on a document, but provides only basic
support for collaboration.  AEN augments locking with an access
control mechanism, discussed next.

\subsubsection{Access Control}

AEN implements three forms of access to individual nodes: read access,
write access, and annotation access.  The administrator(s) of a node can set each
form of access independently for each user of AEN.

When no access is provided to a node, then that node is essentially
private and can be retrieved and edited only by the administrator(s) of the
node. (The creator of a node is given the status of ``administrator'', which
has the effect of irrevocably providing all forms of access. Only the
administrator[s] of a node can delete the node.)

When a user has read access for a node, they can retrieve it but they
cannot add a link to it or edit its contents. Providing only read access to
a node to others indicates that the information is available for use, but
not for review or feedback.

When a user has both read and annotation access for a node, they can both
retrieve it and add a link from the node to a newly created comment
node. Providing both read and annotation access indicates that the
information is available for use and that comments from others about the
content of the node are welcomed.  Annotation access allows the administrator of
the node to solicit suggestions for changes to the contents of the node,
while still retaining control over whether those changes are actually
applied to the document.

When a user has both read and write access for a node, they can both
retrieve it and lock it for editing.  Providing both read and write access
signifies the desire for the closest form of collaborative development, in
which those with write access can make arbitrary changes to the contents of
a node.

Of course, the administrator of a node may grant all three access rights to another
user, which allows them to select which form of feedback to provide.  It is
also interesting to note that without read access, neither annotation nor
write access is useful, since one cannot annotate or lock a node without
first retrieving it.  This is actually quite useful in practice, since it
allows the administrator of a node to temporarily ``hide'' a node simply by
disabling read access to the group.  By re-enabling read access, the
previous annotation, and write access are all reinstated.


\begin{figure}%[htb]
 \centerline{\psfig{figure=screen2.ps,width=6in}}
 {\em This screen shot illustrates some of the real-time support
for strong collaboration in AEN.  The Snoopy window in the lower right hand
corner shows, for each user of the system, whether or not they are logged
in currently and if so, where they are working in the document.  Both user
cmoore and user jeremyt are working on the document node called ``Shared
Emacs''.  The Partyline screen, in the lower right hand corner, allows these
users (as well as all others) to talk to each other while they work.  This
figure also shows a local TOC for the Shared Emacs chapter, and a screen
displaying the current set of unread document nodes for this user.}
 \caption{Screen Shot of AEN's Main display, Snoopy, Partyline,  Node List
 and TOC.}
 \label{fig:Screen2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Context-Sensitive Table of Contents}

The access control mechanism determines which nodes a user may read and
what they may do to the node once they have read it, but it does not help
the user determine which node they want to read.

The primary navigation mechanism  provided by AEN is {\em tables of
contents}.  Each table of contents (TOC) is a dynamically generated, linear
traversal of document nodes in the database, organized according to the AEN
Backbone structure described in Section \ref{sec:aen-backbone}.  Figures
\ref{fig:Screen1} and \ref{fig:Screen2} each contain an example of a table
of contents.  Each line in a TOC is mouse-sensitive, and middle-clicking on
it retrieves the corresponding node (or section within a node) from the
server.  The indentation of headings provides a visual cue to the
hierarchical structure of the hypertext.  Once the TOC is displayed the
user can collapse or expand the listing to reduce or enlarge the number of
listings present.


AEN generates a TOC based upon a starting node that the user chooses.  The
TOC algorithm only analyzes document nodes for which the user has read
access, thus, the TOC is both location and user-specific.  The algorithm
only visits the children of a node once, which breaks cycles in the
hypertext. Finally, each time a document node is written to the server,
structural information relevant to the TOC is extracted, cached, and
propagated to all clients if it has changed. Such a mechanism is crucial to
the usability of the system; one cannot retrieve every document node from
the database each time a TOC is generated.


\subsubsection{Node Lists}

The tables of contents provide the most important perspective on the
hypertext---that of the document-level structure, but other viewpoints are
also useful.  Users can make queries for nodes satisfying various criteria
with the node-list mechanism. In AEN, useful criteria so far include the
type of nodes, whether or not the nodes have been retrieved by this user
yet, and the nodes owned by the user.

Each node-list returned from a query consists of a mouse-sensitive
list of node names appearing in a single screen. Middle-clicking
on the node retrieves it in the standard fashion for AEN navigation.

The Hyperstar Bulletin \foot{The name of this mechanism is a pun on the
name of Honolulu's evening newspaper: the Star-Bulletin.} is an agent-based
mechanism intended to support collaboration via a daily ``snapshot'' of
what has changed in the database since each user last visited it.  The
Hyperstar Bulletin consists of an agent process that wakes up at
approximately 4 a.m. each morning and sends a daily electronic
``newspaper'' to each participant containing a listing of which nodes (for
which the user has read access) have been created or changed since the last
time the user logged in. 


\subsubsection{Snoopy and Partyline}

The mechanisms described above support the construction of a hypertext by
multiple authors, but falls short of support for strong collaboration in
one crucial way.  With these above mechanisms alone, the actual people
involved in the collaborative activity are ``invisible'' within the system:
their effects upon hypertext document are visible, but they themselves are
not.  To create a physical presence for participants within the system, AEN
provides two additional facilities: Snoopy and Partyline, as illustrated in
Figure \ref{fig:Screen2}.

The Snoopy mechanism allows the user to see who else is at work and have an
idea of what they are working on.  It displays basic information about the
connection status and last read node of the users of AEN. A Snoopy screen
is created automatically each time a user connects to AEN, and is updated
every 30 seconds.  Through Snoopy, each user knows who else is currently in
AEN and where they are in the hypertext.

Partyline is a mechanism for passing real time messages to other users of
AEN.  Partyline allows the user to send a textual message to all the users
currently connected to AEN or send a private message to one other user
currently connected to Partyline.  Partyline is similar to an Internet
``chat'' mechanism.  Typically, users greet the other people when they
log in to AEN with Partyline messages.

Both facilities provide access to the users of AEN.  In order to help
support strong collaboration, users of AEN need access to the other users.
Snoopy and Partyline provide this service.

\section{Development and Status}

\subsection{Brief History}

Research on AEN has been underway for almost one year.  The initial
requirements document for AEN \cite{csdl-94-06} was developed in June,
1994.  In this document, the stated design goal of AEN was to support
virtually all lecture material and participant interactions for a seminar
in collaborative systems to be held in Fall, 1994.  An alpha Version 1.0 of
AEN conforming to these requirements was released for classroom use in
September, 1994.  

Participants in the seminar used AEN to read and react to material posted
by students and the instructor.  Based upon their reactions, the material
was revised and improved, or new material was added. On-line quizzes, as
well as semester projects, assessed the learning process. Face-to-face
classroom meetings provided supplementary forums to discuss things learned
or questioned through on-line activities.  Through AEN, groups of students:
learned how to develop software in Emacs Lisp; used Egret to
implement a collaborative system; designed and presented a project proposal for
their collaborative system; and created a well-structured report on the results
of their effort.

During the Fall, 1995 seminar, the notion of AEN as a testbed for the
concept of strong collaboration emerged.  However, during this initial
usage, strong collaboration occurred only rarely due to system frailty and
incompleteness.  After redesign and rework, I used AEN in a case study
during Spring, 1995, to evaluate the system and better understand its
support for strong collaboration.


\subsection{Current Status}

Since its initial release, AEN has gone through over 30 minor version and
three major versions.  AEN consists of over 12,000 lines of lisp code. I
have authored or co-authored three documents about AEN, CSDL technical
report 94-06 \cite{csdl-94-06}, my Masters thesis proposal
\cite{csdl-94-16}, and a paper published in the Fourth
Workshop on Enabling Technologies: Infrastructure for Collaborative
Enterprises (WET-ICE '95) \cite{csdl-94-20}.

I am cleaning up the code and documentation and writing an on-line tutorial
for AEN, in preparation for AEN's public release in early Fall, 1995.

AEN has been in existence for almost a year.  The initial requirements
document for AEN \cite{csdl-94-06} was developed in June, 1994.  The design
goal of AEN was to support virtually all lecture material and participant
interactions for the seminar.  Participant interaction would consist of
reading and reacting to material posted by students and the instructor.
Based upon the reactions, the material would either be revised and
improved, or new material would be added. On-line quizzes, as well as
semester projects, would assess the learning process. A small number of
face-to-face classroom meetings would provide supplementary forums to
discuss things learned or questioned through on-line activities.  Through
AEN, groups of students were expected to learn how to develop software in
Emacs Lisp, use Egret to implement a collaborative system, design and
present a project proposal for a collaborative system, and create a
well-structured report on the results of their effort.  An alpha Version
1.0 was released for classroom use in September, 1994.  In Fall, 1994, we
both reimplemented and used AEN in a graduate seminar, ICS 613 at the
University of Hawaii.  This process redefined the requirements of AEN, but
did not rigorously evaluate them.  During this process, the notion of our
system as a testbed for strong collaboration emerged.  However, during this
initial usage strong collaboration did not occur except in isolated
circumstances, because of system frailty and incompleteness.  After
redesign and rework, we used AEN in a case study during Spring, 1995, to
evaluate the system and better understand its support for strong
collaboration.

%AEN has been in existence for almost a year.  During the year, it has gone
%through a major change in focus.  The initial requirements document for AEN
%\cite{csdl-94-06} was developed in June, 1994, and an alpha Version 1.0 was
%released for classroom use in September, 1994.  By mid-October, we finished
%a substantial redesign of AEN and released Version 2.2.0.  The design goal
%of AEN was still to support virtually all lecture material and participant
%interactions for the seminar.  Participant interaction would consist of
%reading and reacting to material posted by students and the instructor.
%Based upon the reactions, the material would either be revised and
%improved, or new material would be added. On-line quizzes, as well as
%semester projects, would assess the learning process. A small number of

%In the summer of 1994, we developed the initial requirements behind AEN.  As
%we implemented the system our ideas about collaboration evolved.  We
%started out looking for the tools that helped build a collaborative
%hypertext document.  In Fall, 1994, we both implemented and used AEN in ICS
%613.  This process redefined the requirements of AEN, but did not
%rigorously evaluate them.  During this process, the notion of our system as
%a testbed for strong collaboration emerged.  However, during this

with the Egret collaborative system development environment
\cite{csdl-93-09}.  As with all Egret domain-specific applications, AEN is
a client-server system running over TCP/IP, where clients (implemented as
customized versions of XEmacs) interact with a central server called HBS
(implemented in C++) to store and retrieve information or communicate with
other clients.  AEN consists of a hypertext document and several tools to
support strong collaboration.  The hypertext document represents the text
from which the students learn and the product of collaboration among the
participants.  AEN makes substantial use of Egret's facilities for agents,
or autonomous client processes that extend the system's information
processing capabilities beyond those provided by HBS or the clients.
Figure \ref{fig:aen-architecture} illustrates AEN's basic client-server
architecture.

Any document node can, of course, have a link to it from more
than one other document node in the
hypertext, with the result that the same node can be a ``section'' with
respect to one node, but a ``sub-subsection'' with respect to another.  As a

%The initial requirements of AEN were to create a virtual classroom and move
%nearly all of the lectures for a class on-line into a hypertext document
%called {\em The Annotated Egret}.  The class' subject is how to design and
%construct collaborative systems using Egret.  This class would meet both
%on-line and off-line for discussions about issues.  Most of the interaction
%in the class would occur through annotation of the lecture material with
%new hypertext links to questions, comments, and insights.  A few actual
%classroom meetings would be supplementary forums to discuss things learned
%or questioned through on-line activities \cite{csdl-94-06}.  Chapter

%Another mechanism AEN has to help the user navigate in the hypertext
%document is node lists.
%

%Both facilities provide services that are similar to walking into
%a room containing the other people using AEN.  There are some significant
%differences between AEN's Snoopy/Partyline and the walking into a room.
%When you walk into a room, you can only see the people in the room.  You
%have no idea how long the people have been in the room and when people left
%the room.  Snoopy gives you this information.  You can see how long ago
%people left the room and how long people have been working on their current
%task.

%In a room many conversations can go on simultaneously and you can listen to
%any of the conversations in the room.  Partyline allows you to ``listen''
%to conversations that are sent to the entire room. In a real room it is
%easy to have two conversations at the same time since we can tune out other
%noises.  Partyline does not support two ``global'' conversations well.
%Since Partyline is text-based, users have to read the messages.  When the
%user receives a message they have to see who sent it.  This does not allow
%them to totally ignore the other conversations in the room.  If they
%actually read the message they focus their attention on the other
%conversation and may loose their train of thought of their conversation.

%One special feature that Partyline does allow is to have private
%conversations.  In a real room you can tell when people are ``whispering''
%to each other.  In Partyline there is no indication that two people are
%``whispering''.

%Another special feature of Partyline is that it keeps track of
%conversations.  If a user leaves their workstation and don't log out of AEN
%the Partyline buffer records the Partyline conversations.  When they return,
%the conversations are still accessible in the Partyline buffer.  The other
%users in AEN will know that they still can ``hear'' the conversations
%since Snoopy tells them that the user is asleep.  Snoopy displays the
%asleep message if the user has not done anything in a while.  Partyline
%allows a user to be paged.  Even though the user might be asleep the
%persistence of Partyline will tell them they have been paged.  They can
%respond to the page when they return.

%\subsection{AEN's Process Model}

%All of the above mechanisms are used by AEN to support strong
%collaboration.

%learning and authoring.  The next sections discuss how these mechanisms
%are used for collaborative learning and authoring.

%\subsubsection{Collaborative Learning}

%AEN uses a constructivist model of learning.  Constructivism, often
%associated with Jean Piaget, is the theory that knowledge is constructed
%not just acquired.  The students take an active role in their learning.
%They do not sit passively as knowledge is poured into them.  They interact
%with their instructor and each other to create knowledge.  Piaget contends
%that the restructuring of prior knowledge (learning) requires challenging
%existing views and coordinating old with new knowledge\cite{Piaget77}.

%In AEN the hypertext document represents the textbook, the instructor's
%lectures, and the construction site for learning.  When students explore
%the hypertext document, they can ask questions by annotating the text.  The
%instructor or other students can interact by making annotations on the
%question or changing the original text that raised the question.  This way
%``class discussions'' can take place, and students and instructors can
%explore their views about the subjects.  By using the access control
%mechanism students and instructors can decide who can participate in these
%discussions.  This allows a rich variety to the interactions in the class.

%The Snoopy and Partyline features expand AEN's learning environment by
%providing synchronous communications.  Students can get together in AEN and
%discuss the concepts presented in the text.  They can work together on
%solving the quizzes or projects presented in AEN.  Snoopy and Partyline
%allow the instructor to hold office hours by being ``present'' in AEN at
%given times.  The students can ask the instructor questions and receive
%answers immediately.  The instructor could have a group discussion with all
%the students present in AEN. If anyone decides that they want to save the
%discussion they can create a node in the hypertext document and paste the
%conversation into it.  This way a permanent record of the discussion can be
%kept.

%The combination of hypertext document and synchronous communications allows
%the students to learn in many ways.  They can learn by exploring the text,
%asking questions, answering questions raised by their fellow students,
%building their own hypertext sections or by answering the exams and quizzes
%added by the instructor.  As the class learn, the hypertext document
%will be evolving.  It represents the restructured prior knowledge and
%the current collaborative state of learning for the class.
 

%\subsubsection{Collaborative Authoring}

%Baecker et al. introduced a taxonomy of collaborative
%writing\cite{Baecker93}.  AEN supports many of the features described in
%their taxonomy.  I will discuss each in turn.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item{\bf Roles}
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item{\em Writer:}  AEN's user interface is XEmacs, which is an editor.
%    This allows the user to easily record their ideas and modify the existing
%    text.
%  \item{\em Consultant:}  The Partyline messaging system allows users to
%    participate without actually writing any text.  Consultants are also
%    able to make comments that are not part of the finished document.
%  \item{\em Editor:}  XEmacs and AEN's access control model allow the users
%    to edit the hypertext document.
%  \item{\em Reviewer:}  Annotations to the hypertext document allow all of
%    the users who have annotation access to comment on the hypertext
%    document.  Users can also use Partyline to talk to the author/editor of
%    the node they are reviewing.
%  \end{itemize}
%\item{\bf Activities}
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item{\em Brainstorming:}  AEN allows authors to create nodes to store
%    their ideas.  With the right accesses other authors can build off of
%    nodes created by the other authors.
%  \item{\em Researching:}  AEN does not provide any support for external
%    research.
%  \item{\em Planning:}  AEN's backbone provides an simple mechanism to
%    create an outline structure for the hypertext document.
%  \item{\em Writing:}  AEN's interface and collaborative nature make
%    transforming ideas into text easy.
%  \item{\em Editing:}  XEmacs and AEN's access control model allow the users
%    to edit the hypertext document.
%  \item{\em Reviewing:} Annotations to the hypertext document allow all of
%    the users who have annotation access to comment on the hypertext
%    document.  Users can also use Partyline to talk to the author/editor of
%    the node they are reviewing.
%  \end{itemize}
%\item{\bf Document Control Mechanisms}
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item{\em Centralized:}  AEN's access control mechanism can be used to
%    allow only one author to make changes to the hypertext document.  The
%    other authors would only be able to make comments or suggestions.
%  \item{\em Relay:}  AEN's access control mechanism is dynamic so the
%    access levels for the hypertext document could passed on from one author
%    to the next.
%  \item{\em Independent:}  Authors are able to use AEN's access control
%    mechanism to create their own sections of the hypertext document.  The
%    authors have complete control over the access controls for their
%    sections.
%  \item{\em Shared:}  All authors can share in the  control of the access
%    to a node in the hypertext document.  Through the locking mechanism AEN
%    ensures that the node can only be changed by one author at a time.
%  \end{itemize}
%\item{\bf Writing Strategies}
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item{\em Single Writer:}  AEN's access control mechanism can be used to
%    allow only one author to make changes to the hypertext document.  The
%    other authors would only be able to make comments or suggestions.
%  \item{\em Scribe:}  An author can be designated to record the decisions
%    and comments made by the other authors.  This can easily be done by
%    cutting and pasting from the Partyline.
%  \item{\em Separate Writers:}  Authors are able to use AEN's access control
%    mechanism to create their own sections of the hypertext document. Each
%    of these sections are automatically part of the whole hypertext
%    document.  The authors have control of how much is included into the
%    final document.  They can also control the amount of commenting and
%    editing is done to their sections.
%  \item{\em Joint Writing:}  This is what we call strong collaboration.
%    This is the goal of AEN.  We want to support strong collaboration in
%    AEN.

AEN has two different classes of nodes: artifact
nodes and figure nodes.  Artifact nodes represent textual information in
the hypertext document.  Figure nodes represent graphical information.

\subsubsection{Table of Contents}
d279 1
a279 16
The access control mechanism determines which nodes a user may read, but it
provides no navigational aids to the user.  To help the user navigate
through the hypertext document AEN has a dynamically generated table of
contents (TOC).  The user can ask for a new TOC at any time.  AEN
calculates the new TOC from a starting node that the user chooses.  The TOC
generation algorithm only looks at document nodes the user has read access
to and include links.  It will only visit the children of
a node once.  This rule breaks any cycles in the traversal of a hypertext
network.  Once the TOC is displayed the user can decide what level of
detail they want to view.  Figure \ref{fig:TOC} shows what an example TOC
looks like.  The user can create multiple TOCs starting from different
document nodes.  The table of contents should help users find their way
through the hypertext document.  The TOC provides orienting
information about the hypertext network and prevents the
``lost-in-hyperspace'' phenomenon.  Another mechanism AEN has to help the
user navigate in the hypertext document is node lists.

\subsubsection{Node Lists}
d308 8
a315 9
Node lists are a list of nodes based upon certain
criteria.  AEN provides the user with several built in criteria for
building these lists.  First, AEN allows the user to get a list of all the
nodes of any type.  Second, the user can get a list of all the nodes they
have not read yet or that have changed since the last time they were on
AEN.  Finally, AEN allows the user to get a list of all the nodes they own.
All of the node lists provide the user with a list of nodes from which 
they may select and view. Figure \ref{fig:nodelist} shows what a node list
of unread document nodes would look like.

All of the above mechanisms build upon the basic hypertext document, but we
believe that a plain hypertext document is not good enough for effective
collaboration.  To fully support collaboration there should be a
``physical'' presence in the hypertext document.  Users can
see who else is reading the document, what section they are in and
communicate to any one else using AEN.  These features are difficult to
support by just using hypertext.  The following two mechanisms provide
these features in AEN.
d341 1
a341 10
%With out real time communications we feel
%that a virtual classroom is not possible.  Virtual classrooms with out real
%time communications seem foreign to the us and we believe the lack of
%communication will be a hindrance.  For the classroom we also want a way of
%``seeing'' who was present and what they were doing.  This allows the user
%to ask questions of the people that are present and that have been looking
%at the same piece of the hypertext.  For collaborative authoring we also
%want to be able to see who else is using AEN.  This way authors will be
%able to meet other authors and talk to them. We have added two tools to
%provide this presence and communication in AEN, Snoopy and Partyline.

Both facilities provide services that are similar to walking into
a room containing the other people using AEN.  There are some significant
differences between AEN's Snoopy/Partyline and the walking into a room.
When you walk into a room, you can only see the people in the room.  You
have no idea how long the people have been in the room and when people left
the room.  Snoopy gives you this information.  You can see how long ago
people left the room and how long people have been working on their current
task.
d379 10
a388 10
In a room many conversations can go on simultaneously and you can listen to
any of the conversations in the room.  Partyline allows you to ``listen''
to conversations that are sent to the entire room. In a real room it is
easy to have two conversations at the same time since we can tune out other
noises.  Partyline does not support two ``global'' conversations well.
Since Partyline is text-based, users have to read the messages.  When the
user receives a message they have to see who sent it.  This does not allow
them to totally ignore the other conversations in the room.  If they
actually read the message they focus their attention on the other
conversation and may loose their train of thought of their conversation.
d390 4
a393 4
One special feature that Partyline does allow is to have private
conversations.  In a real room you can tell when people are ``whispering''
to each other.  In Partyline there is no indication that two people are
``whispering''.
d395 10
a404 10
Another special feature of Partyline is that it keeps track of
conversations.  If a user leaves their workstation and don't log out of AEN
the Partyline buffer records the Partyline conversations.  When they return,
the conversations are still accessible in the Partyline buffer.  The other
users in AEN will know that they still can ``hear'' the conversations
since Snoopy tells them that the user is asleep.  Snoopy displays the
asleep message if the user has not done anything in a while.  Partyline
allows a user to be paged.  Even though the user might be asleep the
persistence of Partyline will tell them they have been paged.  They can
respond to the page when they return.

For collaborative learning the hypertext document represents the textbook
for the class and the instructor's lectures. When students have questions
about the textbook or ``lectures'', they can ask their questions by
annotating the text.  The instructor or other students can answer
the questions by making annotations on the original question.  This way
``in-class discussions'' can take place about different topics.  By using the
access control mechanism students or instructors can decide who gets to
read the node and who can participate in the discussions.  This allows
groups to collaborate on a question or project easily.  When the group is
ready, they can allow the rest of the class to view their answer or project.
To find out if anything has changed on their project the students can use
the node lists to see what nodes have changed.  This way they will waste
less time searching for new information.
d422 16
a437 6
The Snoopy and Partyline features expand AEN's textbook by providing
synchronous communications. Students can get together in AEN and discuss the
concepts presented in the text.  They can work together on solving the
quizzes or projects presented in AEN.  Snoopy and Partyline allow the
instructor to hold office hours by being ``present'' in AEN at given
times.  The students can ask the instructor questions and receive
d441 2
a442 2
conversation into it.  This way a permanent record of the discussion can
be kept. 
d448 3
a450 4
added by the instructor.  As the students learn, the hypertext document
will be evolving.  The instructor will change the text to answer the
questions raised by the students.  The students will be creating
sub-documents in the hypertext document to explore the subject.  
d455 72
a526 9
AEN supports two methods for collaborative authoring: {\em proofreading \&
trading the lock}.  In the proofreading method the author can create a node
and ``publish'' it by changing the read and annotate access for the
document.  Then other co-authors can make comments as simple as
proofreading comments or as complex as philosophical discussions.  These
comments could be thought of as marginal notes suggesting changes, new
ideas, or just general comments on the subject.  The author can read the
comments and make changes to the document or comment on the comments.  This
can lead to discussions on the contents of the document.
d528 3
a530 5
In the trading the lock method the author can create a node and
allow other authors to edit the node by giving them read and write access to the
node.  When a node is saved, all connected users viewing the node
see the changes.  In this way two or more co-authors could trade the lock and
make changes that all the co-authors will see.
