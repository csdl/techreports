With the increased use of hypertext, the issues behind collaborative
authoring of hypertext are becoming more important.  This talk presents the
Annotated Egret Navigator (AEN), a system designed to support strong
collaboration among a group as they cooperatively build, review, revise,
improve and learn from a structured hypertext document.  AEN addresses how
strong collaboration can be supported through computer mediation.  It is
designed to support collaborative creation of hypertext and to instrument
the actions of its users in order to understand how such creation occurs.


During Fall, 1994, AEN was used for a graduate seminar on collaborative
systems.  In Spring, 1995 we conducted a case study to evaluate AEN's
support of strong collaboration.  This talk presents the contributions
of our research into strong collaboration, the evaluation of AEN, some
recommendations for encouraging strong collaboration and some future
directions for AEN.
