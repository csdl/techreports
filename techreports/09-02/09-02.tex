\begin{abstract}
One goal of the Hackystat Framework is to facilitate the teaching of
software metrics in classroom settings.  To that end, we have conducted
classroom evaluations in 2003, 2006, and 2008.  This paper reports in
detail on our most recent approach to teaching software metrics in the
classroom by way of an approach called the ``Software ICU''.  In this
approach, students learn about ten empirical project ``vital signs'' and
use the Hackystat Framework to put their students projects into a virtual
``intensive care unit'' where these vital signs can be assessed and
monitored.  We conducted a questionnaire-based evaluation that provides
insight into the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, how it compares
to previous approaches using the Hackystat Framework, and promising future
directions.
