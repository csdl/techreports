<H3>1.0 Introduction</H3>
<blockquote>
<p>Aloha.</FONT> <FONT face=verdana>
I am Michael Paulding, a second year Ph.D. student at the University of
Hawai'i - Manoa (<a href="http://manoa.hawaii.edu/">UHM</a>).&nbsp; My research
advisor is Dr. Philip Johnson and we work in the Collaborative Software
Development Laboratory (<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu">CSDL</a>) at
UHM.&nbsp; My current research interests include the analysis of processes and
products of software engineering inherit to the HPCS community.&nbsp; In the
spring of 2004, I began work on an implementation of the Optimal Truss
Purpose-Based Benchmark (PBB), work which was originally initiated by John
Gustafson at Sun Microsystems.&nbsp; During the summer of 2004, I spent six
weeks at Sun Labs in Mountain View, CA developing automatic tool support for
HPCS size metrics in conjunction with further work on the Truss PBB.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been analyzing data collected during the PBB development
process, including process and product data captured automatically by CSDL's <a href="http://hackystat.ics.hawaii.edu/hackystat/controller?Key=&amp;Page=help&amp;Subpage=intro">Hackystat</a>
system and data recorded by hand.&nbsp; In particular, I have been trying to
characterize my work under the context of productivity to isolate and
understand&nbsp;workflow trends and productivity bottlenecks and
enhancers.&nbsp; This technical report provides an overview of my progress so
far.&nbsp;<br>
  </p>

<H3>2.0 Problem Overview</H3>
<blockquote>
<p>To contribute to the community of purpose-based benchmarks, I have been
working on an implementation of the Optimal Truss PBB intermittently over the
past several months.&nbsp; This project was undertaken with the hope of
achieving two specific goals, namely:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Use the theory and algorithms of parallel computing learned in a
      classroom setting and apply them to a real, tangible HPCS problem (get
      down in the trenches).</li>
    <li>Attempt to surface and understand the software engineering
      issues inherit to HPCS development.<br>
    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The Optimal Truss PBB problem can be summarized by the following description:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Given a set of 3 attachment points on a vertical surface and 1 point away
  from that surface that must bear a load:</p>
  <p>Find a pin-connected steel truss structure that uses as little steel as
  possible to bear a load with a 50% safety factor.<br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Visually, an example of the Optimal Truss PBB problem is presented below:<br>

<p>There's much more that can be said about the Truss PBB problem. For more
details, please see my website for this research (<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/HPC">http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/HPC</a>).</p>
<H3>3.0 Current Work</H3>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been maintaining software engineering data
for each day of development on the PBB in the form of Hackystat diaries and
journal entries.&nbsp; The Hackystat diaries are automatically constructed from
activities that take place within an editor (e.g. Emacs or Vim).&nbsp; Hackystat
sensors for these tools collect activity data and send it to a Hackystat server
for storage and analysis.&nbsp; The journal entries I compiled during PBB
development were personal entries reflecting on processes or products that I
felt Hackystat did not capture.</p>
<p>Here are three examples of the software engineering data I maintained while
working on the Truss PBB:&nbsp; The Hackystat diary and developer journal are
both dated May 2, 2004, while the size metrics graph spans a period of several
days:<br>

(2) manually through developer journals and (3) manually through invocation of
the CCCC size counting tool (LOC).&nbsp; I am still actively working on the
Truss PBB implementation, and you will be able to find additional data as the

<p align="left">In the following sections, I will discuss in more detail some of the most
recent data entries to identify specific processes and products of HPCS
development, including workflow trends and productivity
bottlenecks.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<H3>4.0 HPCS Workflow Trends Uncovered by Hackystat</H3>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the analyses that can be performed on Hackystat data is a workflow
characterization.&nbsp; By reviewing command line invocations from the console,
it is often possible to gain insight into what I was doing on a particular day with respect
to workflow.</p>
<p>Before I delve into the analysis of workflow, some background information is
needed about my design philosophy with regards to the Optimal Truss PBB.&nbsp;
In the early stages of development, I focused on creating a &quot;sequential
workhorse&quot; to represent a unit of computation that required enough
processor time to justify the overhead incurred by communication.&nbsp; More
simply stated, I wanted to make sure that the computation of this unit took more
time than that required to send it from one processor to another (for task
division).&nbsp; On non-Hero architectures such as the one I had access to, the
latency of one communication easily overwhelmed 1,000 multiplication operations.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I did not want the unit of computation to take
significantly longer than communication time, as then I would not be maximizing
the level of parallelism in the solution.</p>
<p>For the Optimal Truss PBB, I defined the unit of computation as the solving
of a truss.&nbsp; Specifically, given a set of attachment points, pin-connected
members, and a load bearing point (with load), the solving of a truss involved
force and moment equilibrium (F</FONT><font face="Verdana"><sub>x</sub></font><FONT face=verdana>,
F</FONT><font face="Verdana"><sub>y</sub>,</font><FONT face=verdana> F</FONT><font face="Verdana"><sub>z</sub></font><FONT face=verdana>
and Moments), deformation checks (does a
member's length exceed the maximum for its material) and summation of
mass.&nbsp; A valid solution is one in which 1) the truss is in equilibrium (not
accelerating), 2) all members meet deformation constraints, 3) total mass is a
real number.</p>
<p>Once this sequential workhorse had been defined, the next step was to
determine how the more complicated task of figuring out how to generate all
possible trusses with minimum (or optimally zero) redundancy and distribute them
equally among the available processors.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to use the Hackystat to identify high level analyses,
such as the one above.&nbsp; Currently, Hackystat provides the architecture for
automatically collecting the raw data needed for the analysis.&nbsp; With
additional effort, one can use this data to understand their own HPCS
development process.&nbsp; For instance, a review of the daily diary assists the
reader with categorizing how much time was spent in developing, debugging,
testing and verification/validation.&nbsp; All this information is present in
command line data, which can enable one to combine the event sequence with
active time to produce a metric indicating how long a developer spends in phases
of HPCS development.&nbsp; The following section provides a simple example of
understanding workflow from Hackystat data.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<H3>4.1 Simple Workflow Analysis</H3>
</FONT>
<blockquote>
<p><FONT face=verdana>The following is a simple example in which the sequence of activities
reported by Hackystat indicates a workflow
trend.&nbsp; From the data, I will make the claim that my programming style tends to follow
the pattern of:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Make incremental change to the source code&nbsp; (e.g. add functionality
      or fix bug)</li>
    <li>Compile code as level 1 verification</li>
    <li>If L1 verification fails, return to step 1</li>
    <li>Write new tests to accompany changes made to the source code</li>
    <li>Run test suite as level 2 verification</li>
    <li>If L2 verification fails, return to step 4</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 1-6 for the next incremental change</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is partial output from the Hackystat diary that supports this pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/HPC/images/HSDD.Snippet.20040501.gif"></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="left"><br>
  The data shows that I edited the point class file for approximately 2 minutes
  (step 1) during the interval between 7:45-7:50pm, indicated by the &quot;(Edit
  File 120s) point.cc&quot; statement.&nbsp; Also during this interval, I am
  performing L1 verification (steps 2 and 3), indicated by the multiple compile
  statements (g++ ...).&nbsp; In this snippet of output, it is evident that I am
  using the full compilation commands rather than running the &quot;make&quot;
  process.&nbsp; Although &quot;make&quot; simplifies and makes L1 verification
  a routine task, its command line call does not provide the level of detail
  appropriate for data analysis (e.g. the &quot;g++ -c point.cc&quot; line would
  read &quot;make ...&quot;, which would not indicate the files undergoing L1
  testing).&nbsp; I address this inadequacy in more detail in section 4.</p>
  <p align="left">From 7:50-7:55pm, the Hackystat diary shows that I am starting
  to perform L2 testing (step 4).&nbsp; For example, I run testpoint.exe at 7:51
  as part of L2 testing to ensure that the changes made to the source code did
  not break existing test cases.&nbsp; Apparently, something in the point.h file
  caused the existing test suite to fail.&nbsp; Therefore, at 7:52, I edit the
  point.h file to fix the error and verify it in the call to testpoint.exe at
  7:53pm.</p>
  <p align="left">From 7:55-8:00pm, it is evident that I am adding test cases to
  support the incremental change in the source code by the &quot;(Edit File 60s)
  testpoint.cc&quot; statement at 7:56pm.&nbsp; To complete L2 verification, I
  run the testpoint.exe suite to ensure that the code passes (steps 5 and
  6).&nbsp; It does, and I begin the next incremental change to the source code,
  restarting at step 1.</p>

<H3>5.0 Productivity Bottlenecks Uncovered by Developer Journal Analysis</H3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hackystat data is quite useful for understanding the &quot;process&quot;
aspects of my PBB development, but it does not tell the whole story in regards
to productivity aspects.&nbsp; For instance, in the development streams of
section 3.1, Hackystat does not report why I am making incremental changes to
the source code.&nbsp; Am I adding functionality? Or fixing a bug?&nbsp; To
answer these questions, we must currently use some more intrusive technique,
such as interviewing the developer. In future, with additional instrumentation
support, Hackystat might be able to provide better automated insight into
characterizing what kind of development is occurring at various points in
time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, however, my way of dealing with the limitations of Hackystat data
collection and analysis has been to keep a personal
journal to record information that I thought might be important to the development
process, but not covered by Hackystat.&nbsp; In the journals I've been
maintaining during
the Truss PBB development, I recorded information about defects I encountered
(primarily related to HPCS), insights discovered and calibration data, such as
self-reported active time and files edited.</p>
<p>An excerpt of this data is presented below to indicate a productivity
bottleneck I encountered during development, but was not uncovered by Hackystat:
</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>

  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman"><o:p>
  The sequential implementation of the truss optimization problem is now
  reaching the point in which a linear algebra solver must be incorporated into

  available packages bear a significant memory burden as a result of the large

<p align="left">The entire journal entry can be found <a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/HPC/logs/journals/HackyHPC.SeqWorkhorse.20040501.pdf">here</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A listing of all journals appears at <a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/HPC/#Logs">http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/HPC/#Logs</a>.</p>
<p align="left">As the journal entry indicates, a productivity bottleneck
occurred when I was faced with the problem of solving equilibrium constraints on
the truss.&nbsp; The shortest path to a solution was to install third-party
software (namely LAPACK) to provide the routines needed.&nbsp; However, this
incurred quite a bit of overhead and productivity degradation, as each machine
in the cluster needed to be installed with this ~40MB package.&nbsp; In addition
to the memory requirements, root access to the cluster needed to be gained as
well as 1-2 hours of administration time to perform and verify the
install.&nbsp; Since the machine was not owned by my research lab, the complete
process from requesting LAPACK, to having it approved, installed and verified
took 3 days.&nbsp; Perhaps this time constraint could be reduced in an industry
setting, but it is still a great bottleneck in productivity.</p>
<p align="left">In addition, this third-party software requirement renders my
source code difficult to port to other architectures.&nbsp; For my
implementation to execute properly, I would have to repeat the installation
request on the new machine, therefore increasing the overhead by another order
of magnitude.</p>
<p align="left">Issues such as these are crucial to record in a developer
journal for future reflection and analysis.&nbsp; While a formal, stylized
journal entry has its benefits, I believe it might also be sufficient to use email for this
purpose, as long as the message is archived and easily retrievable.<br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<H3>6.0 Implications for 10x Productivity Improvement</H3>
<blockquote>
<p>The current infrastructure for HPCS metrics collection seems incomplete for
gathering the data necessary to understand major productivity bottlenecks.&nbsp;
There are many tools for analyzing the performance of a particular benchmark,
but I have not found tools for analyzing the development process.&nbsp; Data
such as active time, workflow trends and time allocation are usually
self-reported in a conversation, meeting or email dialog, but not in an
consistent, ordered and automatic manner.</p>
<p>I believe the Hackstat system in its current state can gather critical
metrics such as active time, developer workflow and time allocation with little
overhead.&nbsp; I also believe that Hackystat can be extended to provide
finer-grain analyses to isolate productivity bottlenecks.&nbsp; For example, I
have heard several HPCS developers and researchers note that a large portion of
the total development time is dedicated to integrating sequential code with MPI.&nbsp;
However, I have not heard any measurements quantifying this claim.&nbsp; From my
own experience, I believe this hypothesis to be true, but as far as I know, the
data is not available yet.</p>
<p>One task that interests me and which I have been pursuing is to be able to
statically analyze HPCS source code (written in either Fortran, C or C++) to
isolate MPI constructs and library calls.&nbsp; I am planning to write software
to create and traverse parse trees for the purpose of analyzing whether a
particular file contains MPI directives.&nbsp; Upon traversal completion, I will
then be able to produce a metric quantifying the MPI occurrence(s) within a
file.&nbsp; Once this metric has been calculated, I can then couple it with
Hackystat active time data and compare it to other files within the software
package.</p>
<p>With an analysis such as this, I hope to classify how much of active time is
devoted to sequential vs. parallel aspects of the code.&nbsp; I will also be
able to produce a ratio for lines of code devoted to each category.&nbsp;Eventually, I
hope to be able to understand what particular MPI
directives have consumed the most of my development times.&nbsp; Finally, I will
be able to show data that confirms or denies the claim that integrating
sequential code with MPI consumed the majority of development time on my Optimal
Truss PBB implementation.</p>

integrating Hackystat data and developer journals with HPCS development.&nbsp; I

</blockquote>
<p>*Note about source code: The first iteration of the Optimal Truss PBB is
successful at permuting all possible topologies of trusses and distributing them
evenly among the available nodes.&nbsp; It is also effective at assigning a
geometry to the truss, in which members are defined as steel struts or
cables.&nbsp; I have worked on the functionality to solve a truss for
equilibrium and deformational constraints using the LAPACK solver sequentially,
but this has not been integrated in the parallel solution.&nbsp; I am still
looking for libraries with similar capabilities as LAPACK (e.g. linear solvers),
but without all the overhead.&nbsp; This code is still very much a work in
progress.<br>
</p>
<H3>8.0 Future Directions</H3>
<blockquote>
<p>An outline of the future directions for Hackystat HPCS application is as
follows (hopefully to be done in parallel):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Begin second iteration of Truss PBB development, including a parallel
    implementation of equilibrium constraints, including those of deformation,
    force and moment.</li>
  <li>Create a shell wrapper for the &quot;make&quot; utility to send specific
    commands to Hackystat (e.g. make truss_sequential sends g++ point.o joint.o
    topology.o truss.o -o truss_sequential.exe to diary)</li>
  <li>Capture results of L1 verification from the compiler (e.g. compile passed
    or failed)</li>
  <li>Capture results of L2 verification from the test suite (e.g. unit tests
    passed, failed or caused error)</li>
  <li>Add current working directory to the Hackystat diary</li>
</ol>
