<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This report describes the initial findings of Hackystat-SQI. Hackystat-SQI
  is a Hackystat configuration that provides the ability to support multiple
  JPL projects. The unique aspect of this system is that JPL project differ in
  many ways and Hackystat-SQI must be able to support and understand those differences.  </p>
<p>The biggest success that we have had this summer is understanding how to support
    these differences within Hackystat. We believe that the design document &lt;<a href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/04-09/04-09.html">http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/techreports/04-09/04-09.html</a>&gt;
    is the best possible design that will allow Hackystat-SQI to support any
    JPL project that uses Harvest. When this design is fully implemented SQI
    personnale will be able to extract data from any project's Harvest Instance
    and automatically be able to use any Hackystat analysis that is available.</p>
<p>This document describes the current set of analyses that are available and
  future steps that can be taken. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Goals of Hackystat-SQI</h2>
<p>Lets first discuss the goals of Hackystat-SQI. At the very general level,
  the goal of Hackystat-SQI is to be able to support the collection and analysis
  of multiple projects at JPL. The current restriction to that Goal is that the
  projects that we are able to currently investigate are projects that use Harvest.
</p>
<p>The immediate goals for the summer of 2004 are to be able to address the following
issues: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Defects per release</li>
  <li>New work per release</li>
  <li>Time from defect discovery to defect fix</li>
  <li>Defect per subsystem</li>
  <li>Defect discovery after a release</li>
  <li>Defect density (requires loc)</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, Hackystat-SQI can address the first two issues. The others
  requires additional data to be extracted from Harvest, a LOC tool, a subsystem
  mapping, and various other data that are not obtainable from the current set
  of data that we have. I will address the issues in further datail in other
  sections of this document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hackystat Harvest Mapping</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, the fundamental problem that this Hackystat system must solve
  is the differences in the development processes of the
  projects we will be supporting. The JPL projects that we will be support all
  use Harvest for version control. However, that is where the similarity begins
  and ends because Harvest can be configured differently for each project. There
  are two main areas of differences in the configurations of Harvest; (1) Harvest
  Package Model and (2) Harvest State Change Lifecycle. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Harvest Package Model</strong> represents a way to categorize
    the different types of "work" that is done on the system. The different types
    of work are represented with Packages with in the model. For example, a defect
    can be represented with package type "A" and a new functionality can be represented
    with package type "B". See the Harvest Package Model section for more detailed
    information.</li>
  <li>The <strong>Harvest State Change Lifecycle </strong>represents how these
    packages move through a development cycle. The lifecycle contains a set of
    Harvest States that represents exactly where in the development cycle the
    packages is currently in. For example, a package that is being currently
    developed can be in the "Dev" Harvest State. See the Harvest State Change
    Lifecycle section for more detailed information. </li>
</ul>
<p>There has been an ongoing discussion between Rich Hug and I whether we should "normalize" the
  data before sending it off to Hackystat. (By normalized we mean fit specific
  package models and state change lifecycles into a generic mapping). However,
  we feel that the differences between the model and lifecycles should not be
  hidden, because in fact these differences can affect quality! Therefore, we
  have decided that we shall send all data to Hackystat in their true form and
  allow Hackystat to process the differences. </p>
<p>To solve this problem we have designed a mapping mechanism that allows the
  correct interpretation of the differences in the models and lifecycles. The
  following graphics illustrates the mapping system; (first graphic) model mapping,
  (second graphic) lifecycle mapping):</p>
<p><img src="HarvestPackageMapping.JPG" width="1240" height="528"></p>
<p><img src="HarvestStateMapping.JPG" ></p>
<p>Constructing these mappings allows Hackystat-SQI to process any JPL project.
  The current status of this mapping system is still under review and should
  be fully implemented in the coming months. However, we believe this is critical
  for Hackystat-SQI to be scalable in the long-run as we start to investigate
  other projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Hackystat Analyses</h2>
<p>This section provides screen shots and explanations of the current set of
  analyses that are available in Hackystat-SQI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Project Summary Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>The following analyses provides summaries of all the data that Hackystat-SQI
  has about a specified project. </p>
<p><img src="projectsummary-mds.JPG" ></p>
<p><img src="projectsummary-tcdm.JPG" ></p>
<p>Even at this level there are interesting similarities and differences between
  the two projects. Notice that there are about the same number of state changes
  in both projects. Yet, the MDS project has twice as many packages moving through
the system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Release Summary Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>This analysis breaks down the project summary into different releases. </p>
<p><img src="releasesummary-comparative-mds.JPG" ></p>
<p><img src="releasesummary-comparative-tcdm.JPG" ></p>
<p>Again there are differences between the two projects.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These next screen shots shows a specific MDS release. The Hackystat analysis
  can show what Packages made it into the release, what developers contributed
  to the release, what files have been released, and what types of files are
in the release. </p>
<p><img src="releasesummary-detailed-mds1.JPG" ></p>
<p><img src="releasesummary-detailed-mds2.JPG" ></p>
<p>This last screen shot shows that this release contained a large portion of
  java code. A little more investigation shows that this is the only release
  in the last year that was contained so much java code. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Transition Sequence Summary Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>This analysis shows the real Harvest State Change Lifecycle of the projects.
  Knowing the transitions can show where the &quot;bottlenecks&quot; in developement are.</p>
<p><img src="transitionsequence-mds.JPG" ></p>
<p><img src="transitionsequence-tcdm.JPG" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Harvest Package Summary Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>This analysis provides a summary of every package within the system which
  the specified attributes. In addition, it is an easy way to drill down in the
  data finding specific information about specific packages. </p>
<p><img src="packagesummary-mds.JPG" ></p>
<p><img src="packagesummary-tcdm.JPG" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>List Package Sensor Data Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>This analysis lists the sensor data associated with a package. &quot;Sensor Data
  &quot; is the lowest level of data that is stored in Hackystat.</p>
<p><img src="listpackagesensordata-mds.JPG" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Harvest Package Data Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>This analysis provides a representation of a Package. This analysis reads
  in &quot;Sensor Data&quot; and calculates the values you see below. </p>
<p><img src="harvestpackagedata-mds.JPG" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Package Age Summary Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>This analysis provides a box and whisker chart of Package Ages. </p>
<p><img src="packageagesummary-mds.JPG" ></p>
<p>The black line indicates the mean. The black dot is the median. </p>
<p>The average age, which is the measurement in days of how long it takes a package
  from being created to closed, of CPs is ~13 days. A project can use this average
  to help estimate the amount of &quot;work&quot; that is needed to finish a package.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="packageagesummary-tcdm.JPG" ></p>
<p>You should notice that the average ages for TCDM packages are much higher
  than MDS ages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>File Summary Analysis</b>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="filesummary-mds.JPG" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<b>Developer Association Summary Analysis</b>
<p><img src="developerassociation-mds.JPG" ></p>
<p><img src="developerassociation-tcdm.JPG" ></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Telemetry Analyses</h3>
<b>Active Developer</b>
