\section{Results of the Pre-pilot Study}

We conducted a pre-pilot study to try out our methodology to examine its
capabilities, look for its limitation on studying software process
compliance and explore the analysis techniques.  Eventually, we will
exapand this method to do pilot study and experiment on Test-Driven
Development. In our pre-pilot study, we prepared a Test-Driven Development
tutorial in a simple and graphic format for test subjects.  All subjects
received the same document and were provided enough help to understand what
TDD is and how to develop in TDD fashion. The programming task is to
develop a ``stack'' data structure following the supplement material with
step-by-step hints, which is a comprimise in this study because we wanted
to test how our methodology not how capable the subjects can implement
stack in TDD. The stepwise hints of stack implementation are excerpted and
adapted from Newkirk's book \cite{} One professor, two professional
software developers, two graduates and two senior undergraduates
participated in this experiment. Among them, two developers had no prior
knowledge and experince of TDD at all.  All of them finished the task and
nobody's data was tossed away in the analysis.
