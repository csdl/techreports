\subsection{Results from prior NSF research}

The PIs for this project have had the following NSF-supported projects during the past five years:

\begin{enumerate}
\item P. Johnson, {\em Human centered information integration for the Smart Grid}, NSF
  Grant IIS-1017126, 8/15/10 - 8/14/13, \$381,467. The objective of this
  research is to design information technology and associated experimental
  methods to help understand what information, provided in what ways and at
  what times, enables consumers to make positive, sustained changes to
  their energy consumption behaviors. Selected publications include
  \cite{csdl2-10-05,csdl2-10-07,csdl2-11-02,csdl2-11-03,csdl2-11-07}.


\item P. Johnson, {\em Supporting development of highly dependable software through
    continuous, automated, in-process, and individualized software
    measurement validation}, NSF Grant CCF02-34568, 9/01/02 - 8/31/07,
  \$638,000.  The objective of this research was to design, implement, and
  validate software measures within a development infrastructure that
  supports the development of highly dependable software systems.  Selected
  publications for this project include
  \cite{csdl2-04-22,csdl2-04-13,csdl2-04-11,csdl2-03-12,csdl2-02-07,csdl2-03-07,csdl2-04-02,csdl2-04-04,csdl2-04-11,csdl2-06-07,csdl2-06-08,csdl2-06-13,csdl2-06-06,csdl2-09-01}.

\item A. Kavcic, {\em Energy-Efficient Communication with Optimized ECC Decoders:
    Connecting Algorithms and Implementations}, NSF Grant ECCS-0725649, 09/01/07 -
  08/31/10, \$120,000. This is a joint project with MIT. The PI is
  responsible for reshaping Reed-Solomon soft decoding algorithms for VLSI
  implementation. This is a hardware design project, and the chip is in the
  tape-out phase. Publications to date that cover the theoretical aspects
  of the project
  are~\cite{Bellorado10a,Bellorado10b,Lim08,Lim08a,Lim10,Lim10a}.


\item A. Kuh, {\em Incremental and Distributed Learning in Nonstationary
    Environments with Applications to Wind Forecasting}, NSF Grant ECCS-098344,
  9/01/09 - 8/31/11, \$150,251.  The objective of this research is to
  design novel nonlinear kernel online and distributed learning algorithms
  for applications including wind forecasting.  Selected publications for
  this project include \cite{kuhetal-10icgc,kowahl-kuh-10ijcnn}.

\item A. Kuh, {\em US-Japan Joint Seminar Information Theory}, NSF Grant 0508025
  \$35,750.  Funds used to support graduate students for conferences and
  for visit to Japan.
\end{enumerate}

Professors Johnson, Kavcic, and Kuh also had NSF support dating back more than 5 years.
