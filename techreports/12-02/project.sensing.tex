\subsubsection{Sensing and monitoring}

{\em The first step in creation of a smart, sustainable microgrid is the
  design and installation of appropriate sensing equipment for both
  electrical and environmental data.  

  Contributions of this part of the research
  include development of experimental procedures and data that can help other
  potential microgrid sites to more easily determine what data needs to be
  collected, where it needs to be collected from, and how frequently it
  needs to be collected. }
