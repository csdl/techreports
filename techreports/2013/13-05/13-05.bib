                   community has based its development on a synthesis of
                   earlier work in interactive 3D graphics, user
                   interfaces, and visual simulation. Currently, the VR
                   field is transitioning into work influenced by video
                   games. Because much of the research and development
                   being conducted in the games community parallels the
                   VR community's efforts, it has the potential to
                   affect a greater audience. Given these trends, VR
                   researchers who want their work to remain relevant
                   must realign to focus on game research and
                   development. Leveraging technology from the visual
                   simulation and virtual reality communities, serious
                   games provide a delivery system for organizational
                   video game instruction and training.},

                   individual or group behaviors with a goal of reducing
                   environmental impact. The history of eco-feedback
                   extends back more than 40 years to the origins of
                   environmental psychology. Despite its stated purpose,
                   few HCI eco-feedback studies have attempted to
                   measure behavior change. This leads to two
                   overarching questions: (1) what can HCI learn from
                   environmental psychology and (2) what role should HCI
                   have in designing and evaluating eco-feedback
                   technology? To help answer these questions, this
                   paper conducts a comparative survey of eco-feedback
                   technology, including 89 papers from environmental
                   psychology and 44 papers from the HCI and UbiComp

                   information technology support of behavior change.
                   Two general purpose open source systems have been
                   implemented: WattDepot and Makahiki. WattDepot
                   provides enterprise-level collection, storage,
                   analysis, and visualization of energy data. Makahiki
                   is a web application framework that supports dorm
                   energy competitions of varying degrees of complexity,
                   including a personalized homepage where participants
                   can complete tasks designed to increase energy
                   literacy that can be verified by competition
                   administrators. The technology and approach will be
                   evaluated in a dorm energy competition to take place
                   in the Spring of 2011, with hundreds of University
                   freshmen. The energy use of each pair of dormitory
                   floors will be metered in near-realtime, and the
                   energy literacy of participants will be assessed

  abstract =      {Due to rising costs and the questionable future of
                   our non-renewable energy reserves, individuals need
                   to become aware of their energy usage. In order to
                   instill these habits earlier, organizations have held
                   energy competitions to promote the reduction of
                   energy. This also has the side effect of reducing the
                   energy cost to the organization holding the
                   competition. Typically, these competitions are held
                   in colleges and universities and there are companies
                   that can provide hardware and software to support
                   them. However, since such solutions can be expensive,
                   we would like a free, open source solution that can
                   be used by any organization. We created Makahiki to
                   be an open source framework for sustainability
                   competitions. We also designed it to be a platform
                   for researchers to investigate user behaviors during
                   an energy competition. However, in order to validate
                   our design, we need to evaluate and test our design.
                   During the course of development, we had three
                   evaluation phases. In the mockup phase, we validated
                   our design before doing any implementation. In the
                   onboarding phase, we investigated how individuals
                   will interact with the system when they visit it for
                   the first time. Finally, in the beta phase, we
                   simulated the competition on a much smaller scale in
                   order to observe how Makahiki might be used in an
                   actual competition. Following these evaluations,
                   Makahiki was used to support the 2011 Kukui Cup,
                   which was held in mid-October. In summary, we claim
                   the following contributions: 1. An open source system
                   for creating serious games for energy competitions.
                   2. A research platform on which researchers can
                   observe user behavior during energy competitions. 3.
                   A methodology for evaluating and testing serious
                   games that involve competitions over a period of
                   time.},

                   performance has been attributed by some to difficult
                   goals set in response to feedback. The present
                   experiment attributes this effect to the presence of
                   both a difficult goal and feedback about performance
                   in relation to that goal. 80 families were asked to
                   set a goal to reduce their residential electricity
                   consumption for several weeks during the summer, half
                   of them by 20% (a difficult goal) and half by 2% (an
                   easy goal). Within each of these groups, half of the
                   families were given feedback 3 times/wk about their
                   consumption. 20 more families served as a control
                   group. As predicted, the 20%-feedback group conserved
                   the most (13.0--25.1%) and was the only one that
                   consumed significantly less electricity than the
                   control. It is concluded that improved performance
                   was a result of the joint effect of feedback and goal
                   setting. The implications of the present research for

                   ``meaningful play'' to facilitate energy awareness,
                   conservation and behavioral change. Each Kukui Cup
                   Challenge combines real world and online environments
                   in an attempt to combine information technology, game
                   mechanics, educational pedagogy, and incentives in a
                   synergistic and engaging fashion. We challenge
                   players to: (1) acquire more sophistication about
                   energy concepts and (2) experiment with new behaviors
                   ranging from micro (such as turning off the lights or
                   installing a CFL) to macro (such as taking
                   energy-related courses, joining environmental groups,
                   and political/social advocacy.) To inform the design
                   of the inaugural 2011 Kukui Cup, we relied heavily on
                   prior collegiate energy competitions, of which there
                   have been over 150 in the past few years. Published
                   accounts of these competitions indicate that they
                   achieve dramatic reductions in energy usage (a median
                   of 22\%) and cost savings of tens of thousands of
                   dollars. In our case, the data collected from the
                   2011 Kukui Cup was generally in agreement, with
                   observed energy reductions of up to 16\% when using
                   data collection and analysis techniques typical to
                   these competitions. However, our analysis process
                   caused us to look more closely at the methods
                   employed to produce outcome data for energy
                   competitions, with unexpected results. We now believe
                   that energy competitions make significant unwarranted
                   assumptions about the data they collect and the way
                   they analyze them, which calls into question both the
                   accuracy of published results from this literature
                   and their effectiveness as serious games. We believe
                   a closer examination of these issues by the community
                   can help improve the design not only of future energy
                   challenges, but other similar forms of serious games
                   for sustainability. In this paper, we describe the
                   Kukui Cup, the design myths it uncovered, and the
                   fixes we propose to improve future forms of

  abstract =      {In theory, In-Home Displays (IHDs) can revolutionize
                   the way utilities communicate information to
                   customers because they can induce changes in customer
                   behavior even when they are not accompanied by a
                   change in electric prices or rebates for purchasing
                   efficient equipment. IHDs provide consumers with
                   direct feedback--real-time information on energy
                   consumption and costs--and turn a once opaque and
                   static electric bill into a transparent, dynamic, and
                   controllable process. However, to what extent do
                   consumers actually respond to the direct feedback
                   provided by IHDs? In this paper, we seek to
                   empirically answer this question by reviewing a dozen
                   utility pilot programs in North America and abroad
                   that focus on the energy conservation impact of IHDs.
                   We also review overall customer opinions and
                   attitudes towards IHDs and direct feedback to the
                   extent that this information is available from the
                   pilot studies. Our review indicates that the direct
                   feedback provided by IHDs encourages consumers to
                   make more efficient use of energy. We find that
                   consumers who actively use an IHD can reduce their
                   consumption of electricity on average by about 7
                   percent when prepayment of electricity is not
                   involved. When consumers both use an IHD and are on
                   an electricity prepayment system, they can reduce
                   their electricity consumption by about twice that
                   amount. In regard to demand response impacts, we find
                   that the impact of time-of-use rates is augmented by
                   direct feedback from IHDs.},

                   appropriate energy-related choices and embrace
                   changes in the way we harness and consume energy.
                   Energy literacy was measured with a written
                   questionnaire completed by 3708 secondary students in
                   New York State, USA. Results indicate that students
                   are concerned about energy problems (affective
                   subscale mean 73% of the maximum attainable score),
                   yet relatively low cognitive (42% correct) and
                   behavioral (65% of the maximum) scores suggest that
                   students may lack the knowledge and skills they need
                   to effectively contribute toward solutions. High
                   school (HS) students scored significantly better than
                   middle school (MS) students on the cognitive
                   subscale; gains were greatest on topics included in
                   NY State educational standards, and less on topics
                   related to ``practical'' energy knowledge such as
                   ways to save energy. Despite knowledge gains, there
                   was a significant drop in energy conservation
                   behavior between the MS and HS students.
                   Intercorrelations between groups of questions
                   indicate energy-related behaviors are more strongly
                   related to affect than to knowledge. These findings
                   underscore the need for education that improves
                   energy literacy by impacting student attitudes,
                   values and behaviors, as well as broad content
                   knowledge.},

                   There are however large differences in estimates of
                   the effect of real-time feedback technologies on
                   energy use. In this study, we conduct a field
                   experiment to obtain an estimate of the impact of a
                   real-time feedback technology. Access to feedback
                   leads to an average reduction in household
                   electricity consumption of 5.7 percent. Significant
                   declines persist for up to four weeks. In examining
                   time of day reduction effects, we find that the
                   largest reductions were observed initially at all
                   times of the day but as time passes, morning and
                   evening intervals show larger reductions. We find no
                   convincing evidence that household characteristics
                   explain heterogeneity in our treatment effects; we
                   examine demographics, housing characteristics and
