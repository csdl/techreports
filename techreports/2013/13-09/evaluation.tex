\chapter{Makahiki and SGSEAM Evaluation}
\label{cha:evaluation}

This chapter describes the way I evaluated the Makahiki framework described in \autoref{cha:makahiki-design} and the SGSEAM method described in \autoref{cha:sgseam-design}. First, I describe the real-world case studies of Makahiki instances realized in the Kukui Cup Challenges at the different organizations, followed by the detailed assessment of applying SGSEAM to Makahiki framework. The evaluation is to address:
(a) obtain insights about the strength and weakness of the Makahiki serious game framework, (b) obtain insights about the strength and weakness of SGSEAM serious game framework assessment method.

\section{Real-world Makahiki Instances Case Studies}

Makahiki, as a serious game framework for sustainability, has been used by different organizations to create multiple serious game instances targeting to educate and foster sustainable behavior among the communities. The first Kukui Cup Energy challenges at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) were held in 2011 for 3 weeks for over 1,000 first year students living in the residence halls. UHM subsequently held the second and third Kukui Cup Energy challenges in 2012 and 2014 for different first year students and different durations, for 9 months and 2 weeks respectively. Hawaii Pacific University (HPU) held their Kukui Cup Energy challenge in Fall 2012 and 2013 for about 200 students each year. An international organization called the East-West Center (EWC) held a Kukui Cup Energy and Water challenge for the international residents living in the residence halls. A Hawaii private school called Holy Nativity School (HNS) held a pilot Kukui Cup challenge for their elementary school students. 

\autoref{table:instances} lists these instances and their different requirements. The major differences involve the duration of the challenge, the population that could participate in the challenge, the type of resource(s) such as energy or water, whether they have smart meters installed, and the type of server hosting. Additional differences in requirements include the type of the authentication for participation and differences in game mechanics. These differences will be described in the result chapter in more detail.

The Makahiki instances deployed at these organizations have to meet these different requirements. The goal of the Makahiki framework is to minimize the effort in supporting the different requirements in various organizations. The real world case study of Makahiki is to look at the different requirements of these organizations, and the corresponding different configurations in the Makahiki framework to support such requirements. A more formal assessment of the strength and weakness of the Makahiki framework is described in the next section, by applying SGSEAM to Makahiki, which assessing the experiences of various stakeholders of the Makahiki framework.

\section{Applying SGSEAM to Makahiki}

This section describes in details the application of SGSEAM to assess the Makahiki framework in order to identified the strengths and weaknesses of both the Makahiki and the SGSEAM itself.

\subsection{Step 1: Plan the Assessment}

The first step of SGSEAM process is to plan the assessment. The deliverable for this step is the assessment plan document. To complete this step, I created a tech report called ``SGSEAM Assessment Plan for Makahiki'', also included in  \autoref{app:makahiki-assessment-plan}. The assessment plan identifies the stakeholders, determines the appropriate assessment approaches according to the available resources, choose assessment participants, and creates the assessment schedule. 

The SGSEAM assessment plan includes two categories of assessment approaches for Makahiki: the in-vivo approaches applied to the real-world UHM, HPU and EWC Makahiki instances, and the in-vitro approaches applied to the UHM ICS691 serious game course as an in-lab experiment.

 \autoref{table:assessment-plan-overview} provides an overview of assessment plan for each SGSEAM stakeholders of the Makahiki framework. \autoref{app:makahiki-assessment-plan} provides the detailed descriptions of the plan.

\end{table}

\subsection{Step 2: Gather Data}

The second step of SGSEAM process is to gather the assessment data by carrying out the assessment described in the assessment plan, recording the data and obtaining game logs. The output of this step is a data repository containing all the assessment data. 

During the period of 4 years from 2011 to 2014, the SGSEAM assessment for Makahiki was carried out by implementing the different assessment approaches for the stakeholder participants, both in real-world Makahiki instances and in-lab experiments. I collected the necessary assessment data and stored them in a central location in a hard drive. \autoref{app:makahiki-data-repository} describes the content of the data repository collected from the SGSEAM assessment of Makahiki. 

\autoref{table:sgseam-makahiki-data} lists the data collected for each stakeholder assessment. More details are described in \autoref{app:makahiki-data-repository}.

  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

\subsection{Step 3: Produce Assessment Report}

After the assessment approaches were carried out and data collected, the data was analyzed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the Makahiki framework. The results of the analysis are described in the \autoref{sec:assessment-result} of the following Results chapter. The final deliverable of the SGSEAM assessment process was created as the improvement action report described in \autoref{app:makahiki-improvement-report}.

\section{Consent from Human Research Study Subjects}
This research interviewed and studied the behaviors of several human subjects including:

\begin{itemize}
\item First year students who played the real world UHM Kukui Cup instances for 2011, 2012 and 2014
\item Students who participated in the UHM ICS691 in-lab experiment study
\item Administrators who used Makahiki to install, design, and manage the real world Kukui Cup instances in HPU and EWC
\end{itemize}

We had obtained their consent to participate into this research from all the above human subjects. The study is also approved by Office of Research Compliance at the University of Hawaii Human Studies Program under the CHS \#20451.

\section{Limitations}

There are several limitations to this evaluation design. SGSEAM is designed to assess any serious game framework from the five major serious game stakeholder's perspectives. We only apply SGSEAM to one serious game framework, Makahiki, which is also designed by us. I have biases resulting from my experience implementing Makahiki that may affect the design of the SGSEAM, as a result of which some of the assessment approaches might not be effective in assessing other serious game framework. As described in \autoref{future:other-framework} of the ``Future Directions'' section, BuildingOS\cite{building-dashboard} by Lucid Design Group, another serious game framework, is a good candidate to be applied with SGSEAM. Our research lab made an effort to contact Lucid Design group for the collaboration. I created the assessment plan (\autoref{app:sgseam-lucid-guide}) for them which we hoped would lead to the application of SGSEAM to the BuildingOS system. But due to the workload of the Lucid design group, the collaboration did not continue.

Without another data point of the application of SGSEAM, there is not enough confidence in the evaluation of the SGSEAM itself. 

One limitation in the application of SGSEAM to Makahiki is the small sample size in the post-hoc interview approach. Due to the nature of the this kind of serious game, it is common to have just one or two system admin(s), game designer(s), and game managers(s). It is often the case that the game designers are the same as the game managers. In our evaluation design, although there are 7 Makahiki game instances in 4 organizations, we can only interview 1 system admin from HPU instance, 3 game designers who is also game managers from HPU and EWC instances. The UHM instances were designed and managed by ourself. We also installed and deployed the instances except the HPU ones, so there is no other sys admin candidate.  

Given this limitations, the application of SGSEAM to Makahiki still resulted in useful insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the Makahiki framework.

\section{SGSEAM Assessment plan for Lucid BuildingOS}

With the hope to collaborate with Lucid Design Group to apply SGSEAM to their Building OS and Building Dashboard serious game framework, I created the SGSEAM assessment plan for them. The plan is described in \autoref{app:sgseam-lucid-guide} as part of the proposed SGSEAM assessment guide for Lucid BuildingOS. 

\autoref{table:lucid-approaches} shows the approaches we recommended
for each stakeholder in the case of Lucid BuildingOS framework.
 
\begin{table}[ht!]
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=0.95\columnwidth]{approach}
  \caption{BuildingOS Assessment Approaches}
  \label{table:lucid-approaches}
\end{table}

Comparing to the approaches of the SGSEAM assessment of Makahiki, the recommendation mainly consists of {\em in-vivo} approaches, such as post-hoc interviews, pre-post test, and in-game surveys. While an in-lab experiment such as the one done in Makahiki is more rigorous, we believe it is too expensive for Lucid's assessment. On the other hand, the in-vivo data reflect the real world interaction between the stakeholders and the framework, thus providing better insight in the real world settings.

By carrying out the assessment described in the plan, we hope to identify the major strengths and weaknesses of the Lucid's BuildingOS framework from the perspectives of major stakeholders, and provide recommendations to any actionable improvements to the developers of the framework.

\section{Summary}

This chapter described the evaluation design for both Makahiki and SGSEAM.  Makahiki, as a serious game framework for sustainability, has been used by different organizations to create multiple serious game instances targeting education and fostering of sustainable behavior among the communities. The real world case study of Makahiki is to look at the different requirements of these organizations, and the corresponding different configurations in the Makahiki framework to support such requirements. A more formal assessment of the strength and weakness of the Makahiki framework is to apply SGSEAM to Makahiki.

According to the SGSEAM process, the assessment plan (\autoref{app:makahiki-assessment-plan}) was created as the first deliverable of the process, also as a tech report \cite{csdl2-13-11} to guide the SGSEAM assessment of Makahiki. The assessment plan identifies the participants in the categories of five SGSEAM stakeholders. Two categories of assessment approaches were determined. The {\em in-vivo} assessment approaches of pre-post effectiveness study, in-game surveys and post-hoc interviews were applied to the real-world Kukui Cup challenges created by the Makahiki framework, to assess the experiences of players, system admins, game designers, and game managers. The {\em in-vitro} assessment approaches of in-lab study used the UHM ICS691 serious game course to assess the experiences in game installation, game design and game development. The assessment schedule was also created during the planning step.

After creating the assessment plan, I carried out the Makahiki assessment according to the SGSEAM plan, a data repository (\autoref{app:makahiki-data-repository}) was created to collect all the assessment data. The data was analyzed to determine the strengths and weaknesses of the Makahiki framework. The results of the analysis are described in the \autoref{sec:assessment-result} of the Results chapter. The final deliverable of the SGSEAM assessment process was created as the improvement action report described in \autoref{app:makahiki-improvement-report}. The report is also available in the tech report format \cite{csdl2-14-12}.
