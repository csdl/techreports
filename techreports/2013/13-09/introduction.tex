\chapter{Introduction}
In this dissertation, I describe the Makahiki research project, which explores the information technology to provide infrastructure to facilitate the development of serious games for sustainability. The research consists of an open source serious game framework for sustainability and a method for assessing a serious game framework based on the stakeholder experience. In this chapter I explain the motivation of the research, briefly describe the Makahiki system and the SGSEAM assessment method,  finally summarize the results and contributions of this research.

\section{Motivation}
The rising cost, increasing scarcity, and environmental impact of fossil fuels
as an energy source makes a transition to cleaner, renewable energy sources an
international imperative. In Hawaii, the need for transition is especially acute, as the
state leads the US both in the price of energy and reliance on fossil fuels as an 
energy source (over 90\% from oil and coal \cite{hawaiienergypolicy}).

One barrier to this transition is the success that electrical utilities have had in
making energy ubiquitous, reliable, and easy to access, thus enabling
widespread ignorance in the general population about basic energy principles
and trade-offs. Moving away from petroleum is a technological, political, and social paradigm
shift, requiring citizens to think differently about energy policies, methods
of generation, and their own consumption than they have in the past.

On the other hand, changing people's behavior with respect to energy holds significant promise in reducing energy use. Darby's survey of energy consumption research found that identical homes could differ in energy use by a factor of two or more \cite{darby-review-2006}. Data from a military housing community on Oahu show energy usage for similar homes can differ by a factor of 4 \cite{Norton2010ZeroEnergyHomes}.

Petersen et al. describe their experiences deploying a real-time feedback
system in an Oberlin College dorm energy competition in 2005 that includes 22
dormitories over a 2-week period \cite{petersen-dorm-energy-reduction}. Web
pages were used to provide feedback to students. They found a 32\% reduction in
electricity use across all dormitories.

Over the past decade, running energy and water challenges have become a focal point for sustainability efforts at university and industry campuses, to facilitate and incentivize energy and water reduction. 
In a 2011 survey \cite{Hodge2010}, Hodge found that 163 universities and colleges held or planned to hold an energy competition during the 2010Ð2011 academic year. 40\% of these organizations are holding a competition for the first time. Hodge found that the average reduction in electricity use during these competitions is 9\%. 

Designers of such challenges typically have three choices for information technology: (a) build their own custom in-house solution (as was done at Oberlin College in 2006 \cite{petersen-dorm-energy-reduction}); (b) out-source to a commercial provider (as was done at the University of British Columbia in 2011 \cite{runkle2011dark}); or (c) use a minimal tech solution such as a web page and manual posting of data and results (as was done at Harvard University in 2012 \cite{harvard-green-cup}).

None of these choices are ideal: the custom in-house solution requires sophisticated design and implementation skills; out-sourcing can be financially expensive and impedes evolution; and the minimal tech solution does not fully leverage the possibilities of advanced information technology.

To provide a better alternative to these three choices, Makahiki is designed as an open source serious game framework for sustainability with the goal of providing the infrastructure to enable different organizations to easily create and manage sustainability related serious games including this kind of sustainability challenges. 

The closest technology to Makahiki of which we are aware is the Building Dashboard \cite{building-dashboard} that supports the Campus Conservation Nationals \cite{competetoreduce}, which has been used by over 100 schools nationwide in 2014 to implement an energy and water reduction competition, including the above mentioned University of British Columbia.  The Building Dashboard enables viewing, comparing and sharing building energy
and water use information on the web in compelling visual interface. But it focused on providing energy usage as passive information. There is little interaction between participants and the system. Unlike Makahiki, the Building Dashboard system does not support game mechanics, education, or synergy between real and virtual world environments.  In addition, it is not open source. The cost of the system creates the barrier for wider adoptions.

\section{Serious games and Gamification}

Another emergent issue is the explosive spread of game techniques, not only in
its traditional form of entertainment, but across the entire cultural spectrum.
Games have been shown with great potential as successful
interactive media that provide engaging interfaces in various serious contexts
\cite{mcgonigal2011reality,reeves2009total}. Priebatsch attempts to build a
game layer on top of the world with his location-based service startup
\cite{Priebatsch2010ted}. The adoption of game techniques to non-traditional areas such as finance,
sales, and education has become such a phenomenon that the Gartner Group
included ``gamification'' \cite{Deterding2011mt} on its 2011 Hype List.

A serious game, defined by Zyda, is ``a mental contest, played with a computer in accordance with specific rules that uses entertainment to further government or corporate training, education, health, etc''.  The system created by Makahiki consists of a number of smaller games which combined,  provides a game playing experience to the participants. So we consider that Makahiki framework produces a serious game, instead of a gamified educational application. While they are different, both gamification and serious games are trying to solve problems by influencing people's behavior utilizing both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Differentiating Makahiki from the other collegiate sustainability competitions are the game design elements in Makahiki. 

An Alternative Reality Game (ARG) is one type of serious game related to Makahiki in the way that they both  blend real and virtual world activities in the serious gaming context. McGonigal defines ARG as ``games you play to get more out of your real life, as opposed to games you play to escape it'' \cite{mcgonigal2011reality}. Her award winning serious ARG game ``World Without Oil'' \cite{worldwithoutoil} and ``Evoke'' \cite{urgentevoke} are designed with the goal of empowering people to come up with creative solutions to urgent real-world problems. Some players reported that the online game affected their real world behaviors \cite{mcgonigal2011reality}.

There are several sustainability related serious games.  Similar to games created by Makahiki, 
Vermontivate \cite{vermontivate} is a team-based game where  the players compete to accrue as many points as possible for their towns or schools by participating in a variety of sustainability-focused actions. Unlike Makahiki, Vermontivate does not have individual points or prizes and relies more on self-reported participation.

Reeves et al. described the design of Power House, an energy game that connects home smart meters to an online multiple player game with the goal to improve
home energy behavior \cite{Reeves2011powerhouse}. In the game, real world
energy data are transformed into a ``more palatable and relevant form of
feedback'', and players may be incentivized by the in-game rewards to complete
more energy-friendly real-world behaviors.

RecycleBank's ``Green Challenges'' \cite {recyclebank} is another serious game that used online gaming techniques to motivate participants to learn about green living and to take small green actions to live more sustainable lives offline.  According to the ``Gaming For Good'' report \cite {gamingforgood}, the challenge showed a 71\% increase in unique visitors and 97\% of participants surveyed said that the challenge increased
their knowledge about how to help the environment.

\section{Game Design and Motivation}

The research in serious games and gamification inspires the design of Makahiki in terms of benefits of a game, game design and how the game design can motivate and engage players in serious contexts. 

Why games? Results of a study published in the May 1998 issue of Nature \cite {koepp1998evidence} demonstrated that video game players experience regular releases of dopamine during game play. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that signals pleasure rewards for food, sex and addictive drugs, such as cocaine. 

Psychology professor Mihaly Czikszentmihalyi introduced a specific kind of happiness that he named ``flow" \cite{csikszentmihalyi1991flow}, which is considered as one of the fundamental reasons that people play games \cite{murphygames}. Flow is a state of absorption, characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed).

Nicole Lazzaro argued that the use of extrinsic rewards will decrease the motivation to use your products and services once you remove that reward \cite {Lazzaro2011}. Vockell resonated that in education psychology, extrinsic motivators may lead to short-range activity increase but reduction in long-range interest in a topic. While intrinsic motivators motivate people best when they are working toward personally meaningful goals \cite{vockell2004educational}. 

In order to design a game that that is intrinsic motivated, Amy Jo Kim presented ``Smart Gamification'' which focuses on designing an effective ``Player Journey'' with intrinsic reward preferred over extrinsic reward \cite {Kim2010}. Kim pointed out that intrinsic values are greater than extrinsic rewards and ``a good game takes the player on a journey toward mastery".

The design of Makahiki is influenced by the above game design thinking. It combines extrinsic rewards such as prizes and achievement badges with intrinsic motivation such as improving our environments by learning. Makahiki employs Kim's player journey idea \cite{Kim2010} to design the on-boarding and progression of levels in the smart grid game. Other game mechanics, such as the ``appointment mechanics'' and the ``social interaction'' are also employed in the design of Makahiki.

\section{Serious game Framework assessment}

One of the benefits of using a game framework is that, if correctly designed, it will provide useful and
reusable ``building blocks'' with which to develop a variety of serious games. Yet how are we to know
 if a serious game framework has been ``correctly designed''?
 
In order to assess a serious game framework such as Makahiki, it is important to assess the serious games the framework produces.  One fundamental question in evaluating a serious game is the extent to which the
game achieves its ``serious'' purpose.  This is quite different from traditional entertainment games, in which evaluation focuses on usability or playability \cite{song2007new}. In the field of serious games, there is an increasing focus on the methodology of game evaluation \cite{Mayer2012233}. 

De Freitas and Oliver \cite{de2006can} point out that there are few frameworks to support the evaluation of education games. They introduce a four dimensional framework for evaluating 
educational games and simulations. The framework consists of: the context, the pedagogy, the representation, and the learner (or player).

These approaches focus on evaluation of a single serious game, as opposed to a serious game {\em \bf 
  framework}.  There exists some general purpose assessment tools such as GEQ (Game Engagement Questionnaire)\cite{brockmyer2009development} and QUIS (Questionnaire for User Interaction Satisfaction)\cite{harper1993improving} that are used for measuring game engagement and user interactions. 
  
During my literature search, I have not found any research in the area of assessment method for serious game framework. The design of SGSEAM is to provide an assessment method for the particular needs of assessing a serious game framework. 

\section{Research Description}

The overall research question this thesis investigates is:
What forms of information technology infrastructure can support effective and efficient development of serious games for sustainability?

In order to address this research question, I have designed two systems:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A software  infrastructure for development of serious games for sustainability.

    \item An assessment method that provides evidence regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the software infrastructure for the development of serious games for sustainability.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Makahiki}

I developed an innovative serious game framework for sustainability called Makahiki, as a software infrastructure for the development of sustainability challenges. Makahiki explores one section of 
the design space where virtual world game mechanics are employed to affect real world sustainability
behaviors.  The ultimate goal of the Makahiki project is not just to affect behaviors during the course
 of the game, but also to produce long lasting, sustained change in behaviors and outlooks by participants.

 Makahiki has a unique feature set intended to foster more rapid innovation and development. These 
 features include: (1) an open source license and development model which makes the technology 
 available without charge and facilitates collaborative development and improvement; (2) support for an ``ecosystem'' of extensible, interrelated, customizable games and activities; (3) real-time game 
 analytics for research and evaluation; (4) pedagogically organized and extensible learning activities; 
 (5) a responsive user interface supporting mobile, tablet, and laptop displays; and (6) support for 
 deployment to the cloud as an inexpensive option for hosting the competition.

The Makahiki framework has been successfully used to create and manage seven real-world sustainability games by four organizations, in different environments and with different requirements. The instance are: 1) the Kukui Cup energy challenges at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 2011, 2012 and 2014; 2) the HPU Kukui Cup energy challenges at the Hawaii Pacific University in 2012 and 2013; 3) the East West Center energy and water challenge in 2012; and 4) the Kukui Cup educational challenge at the Holy Nativity School in 2013.

\subsection{SGSEAM}

While these real world Makahiki instance provides some evidence regarding the ability of the Makahiki framework to support sustainability games in different environments, a more rigorous evaluation of Makahiki would yield better quality insight.  In order to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of software infrastructure for serious games for 
sustainability, I designed an assessment method called Serious Game Stakeholder Experience Assessment Method (SGSEAM). In a nutshell, SGSEAM (pronounced ``sig-seam'') identifies the most important stakeholders of a serious game framework and provides a method for gaining insight into the strengths
and shortcomings of the framework with respect to each stakeholders' needs. We consider
SGSEAM as an assessment method instead of an evaluation method. The main purpose of an
evaluation is to ``determine the quality of a program by formulating a judgement''
\cite{hurteau2009legitimate}. An assessment, on the other hand, is nonjudgmental. SGSEAM does
not try to judge a framework according to a standard, instead, it is used to identify the major
strengths and shortcomings of a framework so that the community could benefit from the
assessment by learning from the strengths and improving the shortcomings.

SGSEAM identifies the major stakeholders whose experiences affect a serious game framework as a software infrastructure as: players, system admins, game designers, game managers and game developers. For each stakeholder, multiple {\em in-vivo} and {\em in-vitro} assessment approaches can be used, depending on the resources available. The more approaches applied, the higher one's confidence in the accuracy of the assessment results.


\subsection{Evaluation}

Makahiki, as a serious game framework for sustainability, had been used by different organizations to create multiple serious game instances targeting to educate and foster sustainable behavior among the communities. The first Kukui Cup Energy challenge at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) was held in 2011 for 3 weeks for over 1,000 first year students living in the residence halls. UHM subsequently held the second and third Kukui Cup Energy challenges in 2012 and 2014 for different first year students and different durations, for 9 months and 2 weeks respectively. Hawaii Pacific University (HPU) held their Kukui Cup Energy challenge in Fall 2012 and 2013 for about 200 students each year. An international organization called the East-West Center (EWC) held a Kukui Cup Energy and Water challenge for the international residents living in the residence halls. An Hawaii private school called Holy Nativity School (HNS) held a pilot Kukui Cup challenge for the elementary school students. 

The successful creation of serious game challenges by four different organizations
provides evidence that Makahiki can be successfully tailored
to the needs of different organizations. First, UH and HPU used different metering
infrastructure, and EWC collected their resource data manually. HNS did not have energy data at all. 
Second, while UH and HPU
challenges involved only energy consumption data, the EWC challenge involved both energy
and water consumption data. Third, the IT infrastructure at UH and HPU provided
authentication services using CAS (Central Authentication Service) and LDAP, while EWC
used UH's CAS and the built-in Django authentication.  Fourth, the user interface was customized to
``brand'' each challenge with the logo, thematic elements, and the education contents of
the sponsoring organizations. Lastly, HPU instances were hosted in its local infrastructure, while UHM, EWC and HNS were hosted in the Heroku PaaS cloud.

The real world case study of Makahiki is to look at the different requirements of these organizations, and the corresponding different configurations in the Makahiki framework to support such requirements. A more formal assessment of the strength and weakness of the Makahiki framework is to apply SGSEAM to Makahiki.

Besides the real world usage of Makahiki in the series of Kukui Cup challenges, we
performed in-lab assessment experiments in 2013. Makahiki was used in a serious game
development course in Spring semester of 2013 at the Information and Computer Sciences
Department of the University of Hawaii at Manoa. There were a total of 8 students who
participated in the experiments.  The participants were either senior undergraduates or
graduate students majoring in Computer Science. During the course, the students installed
Makahiki, configured and designed a serious game instance with Makahiki, and finally
developed an enhancement to the Makahiki framework. We asked the students taking the
course to voluntarily participate in the assessment experiments of Makahiki, using SGSEAM.

In this research, I applied SGSEAM to Makahiki. The {\em in-vivo} assessment approaches of pre-post effectiveness study, in-game surveys and post-hoc interviews were applied to the real-world Kukui Cup challenges created by the Makahiki framework, to assess the experiences of players, system admins, game designers, and game managers. The {\em in-vitro} assessment approaches of in-lab study used the UHM ICS691 serious game course to assess the experiences in game installation, game design and game development.
