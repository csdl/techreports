\label{app:in-game-questionnaire}

This appendix details the contents of the questionnaire made available to participants via the in-game questionnaire during the UHM Makahiki challenge. Participants filled out the questionnaire via the SurveyGizmo~\cite{surveygizmo} website. The survey started with the informed consent via inputting  the email address.
