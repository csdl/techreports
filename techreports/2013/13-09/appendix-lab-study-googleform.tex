\chapter{Google Forms for SGSEAM In-lab Experiments}
\label{app:googleform}

This appendix lists the Google forms that were used in the SGSEAM in-lab experiment approach for system admin and game designer assessments. They were presented to the students in the ICS 691 class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Spring 2013 as parts of their class assignments. The students were voluntarily participated in these assessment experiments.

\section{System admin Assessment}
\label{app:googleform-sysadmin}

There are two google forms to assess the system admin's experience with the Makahiki framework regarding the installation of Makahiki and its software dependencies, based on Makahiki documentation provided online. One google form is the Local installation log to assess the local installation of Makahiki on their personal computers or on a virtual machine created on their personal computers, the other is the Heroku installation log to assess the cloud installation of Makahiki on the Heroku environment.

\subsection{Makahiki Local Installation Google Form}

Please choose the closest value from the list that best matches the time you spent during the installation.

Thank you!
