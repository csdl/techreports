Go to the admin interface, find an action in the action library, and modify the level, category and unlock condition field according to your SGG design. Play-test your grid by logging in as normal player, go to the "Get Nutz" page, unlock Level 4 and all actions in Level 4. Record the time you spent for this step only:
