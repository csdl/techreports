an evaluation mechanism called the Serious Game Stakeholder Experience Evaluation Method (SGSEEM). SGSEEM is designed to provide detailed insights

used Makahiki to conduct a series of serious games for the purpose of
education and behavioral change regarding energy and water

\section{Introduction}

Serious games (games with additional goals beyond just entertainment)
have been the topic of academic research for
decades~\cite{Zyda2005}. Such games have shown great potential as successful
interactive media that provide engaging interfaces in various serious
contexts~\cite{mcgonigal2011reality,reeves2009total}. The recent phenomenon
of gamification~\cite{Deterding2011mt} also calls for game related
research in areas beyond traditional entertainment purposes.

One of the fundamental questions in assessing a serious game is ``Is it
effective in achieving the serious purpose the game?''
This is a different question than the evaluation of traditional
entertainment games, which focus on usability or
playability~\cite{song2007new}. In the area of serious game research,
there is increasing focus on the methodology for the research
and evaluation~\cite{Mayer2012233}. De Freitas and
Oliver described a four dimensional framework~\cite{de2006can} for
evaluating an educational game, the dimensions are: the context, the pedagogy,
the representation, and the learner (or player). Harteveld
proposed another general purpose serious game evaluation framework
called "Triadic Game Evaluation"~\cite{harteveld2010triadic}, which
concerns three evaluation perspectives: the worlds Reality, Meaning,
and Play.

% CAM: We need to organize this section differently. We jump from
% serious games to research on serious games then to game frameworks
% then back to research on serious game frameworks. This feels really
% strange. 

One can go beyond ``one-off'' serious games by developing a serious game
framework or engine. A game framework is ``comprised of a collection of
different tools, utilities, and interfaces that hide the low-level
details of the various tasks that make up a
game''~\cite{sherrod2006ultimate}. One of the benefits of using a
serious game framework is that it provides the building blocks for a game.
These building blocks enable the game developer to focus on game
contents and results instead of the details of the game infrastructure.
The game developer's desired result of using a game framework is spending
less time creating new games.

% CAM: Too many frameworks. Is there another word we can use? Can we
% just use evaluation? It gets confusing in the next section when we
% have a few frameworks for evaluation and then serious game
% frameworks. 

As mentioned earlier, there are few evaluation methods for serious games
and even fewer, if any, formal evaluation methods for serious game
frameworks. To help fill this methodological gap, this paper proposes a
method for evaluating serious game frameworks, called the Serious Game
Stakeholder Experience Evaluation Method (SGSEEM). SGSEEM identifies the
most important stakeholders of a serious game framework and evaluates
the extent to which the framework is effective or efficient with respect
to the stakeholders' perspective.

In presenting SGSEEM, we will first describe the motivation of our
development of a serious game framework for sustainability (Makahiki),
and the need for an evaluation mechanism for Makahiki. Following this,
we give a generic description of SGSEEM, and finally, we will describe
the case study of how SGSEEM is applied to Makahiki. We hope this
research will be of interest to researchers and practitioners across
several disciplines: software engineering, game design, and
sustainability.

\section{Motivation}

Sustainability education and conservation have become an international
imperative due to the rising cost of energy, increasing scarcity of
natural resource, and irresponsible environmental practices. Over the
past decade, energy and water challenges have become focal
points for sustainability efforts at both university and industry
campuses. For example, college residence hall energy competitions have
been a widespread mechanism for engaging students in energy issues,
with more than 160 taking place or being planned for the 2010--2011
academic year in North America~\cite{Hodge2010}.

Designers of such challenges typically have three choices for
information technology support: (a) build their own custom in-house
solution (as was done at Oberlin College in
2006~\cite{petersen-dorm-energy-reduction}); (b) out-source to a
commercial provider (as was done at the University of British Columbia
in 2011); or (c) use a minimal tech solution such as a web page and
manual posting of data and results (as was done at Harvard in 2012).

None of these choices are ideal: the custom in-house solution requires
sophisticated design and implementation skills; out-sourcing can be
financially expensive and impedes evolution; and the minimal tech
solution does not fully leverage the possibilities of advanced
information technology.

To provide a better alternative to these three choices, over the past
two years, we have designed and implemented an open source serious
game framework for sustainability called Makahiki~\cite{csdl2-12-06}.
Makahiki implements an extensible framework with a
variety of common services for developing sustainability games
including: authentication; game mechanics such as leaderboards, points,
and badges; a variety of built-in games and content focused on
sustainability; a responsive user interface; cloud-based deployment;
and the ability to customize the game to the needs of individual
organizations.

To explore the ability of the Makahiki framework to support
sustainability games in different environments, we ran three
challenges at different organizations in Fall 2012: The University of
Hawaii, Hawaii Pacific University, and the East-West Center. While
these experiences provided anecdotal evidence for the usefulness of
Makahiki, we realized that a more rigorous evaluation of the framework
would yield better insight into its current quality and requirements
for future enhancement.

Upon reviewing the literature, we found little research or experience
with formal evaluation for serious game frameworks. To address this, we
designed an evaluation method for serious game frameworks called the
Serious Game Stakeholder Experience Evaluation Method (SGSEEM). SGSEEM
is designed to provide detailed insight into the strengths and
weaknesses of a serious game framework through a
stakeholder-perspective-based approach. We have applied SGSEEM to the
three sustainability challenges based on Makahiki.

\section{Serious Game Stakeholder Experience Evaluation Method (SGSEEM)}

The goal of SGSEEM is to determine to what extent the serious game
framework under evaluation, as an Information Technology (IT)
infrastructure, can effectively and efficiently support the
development and play of a serious game.

An \emph{effective} serious game framework can produce a game with the
desired outcome with regarding to ``serious'' effect to the players. For
example, an effective serious game framework for energy education and
conservation produces a game that should increase players' energy
literacy and reduce their energy consumption during and/or after the
game. Because the effectiveness of serious games are often subject
specific, the effect of a serious game for sustainability is different
than the one of a serious game for language learning, or for healthy
eating. This paper only describes the evaluation of the effectiveness
for a serious game for sustainability.

An \emph{efficient} serious game framework can efficiently support the
full life cycle of game development, execution, and wrap-up of the
serious game, such as design, management, administration, development,
and improvement of the game.

\subsection{Methodology}

SGSEEM employs a mixed method of case studies, with qualitative and
quantitative data analysis. The qualitative analysis includes a set of
interviews that will be administrated to the users of the system to
gain insights about their experiences of their interaction of the
system. The quantitative analysis mainly involves using the analytics
data recorded by the system, such as website logs, player interaction
logs, feedback, resource usage, etc.

\subsection{Mechanism}

%A serious game normally includes real-world activities and
%components. In a sustainability serious game context, they includes
%going out for a educational excursion about sustainability, installing
%smart meters to measure energy consumption, giving out prizes to the
%winners of the game, etc.

There are many more stakeholders in serious
games than in traditional entertainment games. The following are the
common stakeholders we identified for a serious game in the context of
sustainability:

\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Players}: the users who participate in the game play.
\item \emph{Game Designers}: the admin user(s) who design the content
  and game mechanics.
 \item \emph{Game Managers}: the admin user(s) who manage the game
   during the period of game play.
\item \emph{System Admins}: the IT person(s) who installs and maintains
  the technological game infrastructure.
\item \emph{Developers}: the person(s) who extend, enhance and debug
  the game framework.
\item \emph{Researchers}: the person(s) who are conducting research using
  the game framework.
\item \emph{Spectators}: persons who do not participate in the game
  play but are interested in the game and the results of game play.
\item \emph{Community partners}: persons or organizations who partner
  with the game organizers to help run the game (such as coordinating real-world events as part of the game).
\item \emph{Facilities}: persons or organizations who are responsible
  for facilitating the energy and water meter installation and data
  collection.
\item \emph{Funding organizations}: the organizations who provide
  funding to the project.
\end{itemize}

The success of a serious game for sustainability depends on all the
stakeholders. Due to our interest only in the evaluation in an IT
infrastructure or HCI context, we will exclude the evaluation of
spectators, community partners, facilities, and funding organizations.
These are important stakeholders but not necessarily related to the
effectiveness and efficiency of the IT infrastructure.

Our case study evaluation of Makahiki using SGSEEM evaluates (1) the
extent of effectiveness to players, (2) the extent of efficiency to
game designers, game managers, system admins, developers, and
researchers.

\autoref{tab:evaluation-framework} provides an overview of the
evaluation framework. The following sections describe in detail the
evaluation mechanism for each stakeholder in turn.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{1. Player Effectiveness}

To assess the player effectiveness of a serious game for
sustainability, we must evaluate: (a) To what extent does the game
increase player's literacy in sustainability? (b) To what extent does
the game produce positive player behavior change in sustainability?
(c) To what extent does the game engage players?

\autoref{fig:pre-post-eval} illustrates the process for player
effectiveness evaluation, which involves a pre-game and post-game
measurement for literacy and behavior change, as well as the in-game
data logging to measure the level of player engagement.

\begin{figure}
  \center
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{pre-post-eval}
  \caption{Player Effectiveness Evaluation Process}
  \label{fig:pre-post-eval}
\end{figure}

\emph {(a) Literacy assessment:} One important goal of the serious
game for sustainability is the education effect on the
players. A literacy assessment is an indicator of such effect if there
is any.

SGSEEM uses the similar approach described in \cite{csdl2-10-08} to
assess the player's sustainability literacy. A set of literacy survey
questionnaires (pre-game) are be presented to the players at the
beginning of or before the game. After the game ends, the same survey
(post-game) is then be presented to the players who responded the
pre-game survey. These two set of survey response data will be
compared to understand if there is any changes.

The extent of players' sustainability literacy change will indicate
the degree of educational effectiveness of the serious game for
sustainability.

\emph {(b) Behavior change assessment:} Positive behavior change is
another main goal of a serious game for sustainability. A serious game
for sustainability may include some degree of resource
consumption measurement. SGSEEM uses resource consumption data before and
after the game as part of the assessment of the
players' sustainability behavior change.  The resource consumption
baseline prior to the game will be established based on historical
consumption data. During and after the game, we can compare the
resource consumption with the baseline for a particular day to
understand to what extent the resource consumption has changed.

The problems with using a baseline to assess the energy reduction in
the case of dormitory energy challenges is discussed in detail by Johnson et al.~\cite{csdl2-12-08}. As a method for evaluating the
effectiveness of serious game for sustainability in a broader context
beyond the dormitory challenge, we continue to use the baseline
method as one way to assess changes in resource consumption.

In addition to resource consumption, SGSEEM involves conducting a
behavior survey to the players, to measure any self-reported behavior
change. A pre-game survey is be presented to the players to ask about
their current sustainability behavior, then after the game, a post-game
survey is presented to ask about the players' behavior again. These two
sets of survey response data are be compared to understand if there is
any changes.

The combination of resource consumption changes and self-reported
behavior changes, are used to understand the degree of behavior
effectiveness of the serious game for sustainability.

\emph {(c) Engagement assessment:} Player engagement is an important
measure for understanding the effectiveness of a serious game. By
investigating the degree of engagement, we can determine whether the
players are actively participating in the game thus any changes in the
player's literacy and and behavior are potentially related to the
participation in the game. On the other hand, if there is little or no
participation, we could safely deduce that if there are any changes in
sustainability literacy and behavior, they are mostly caused by
something else, not the serious game in question.

A serious game should include detailed log data for the players'
interaction with the game. The following are the player engagement
metrics SGSEEM measures:

\begin{itemize}
\item active participation rate
\item number of players per day
\item average session time
\item submissions per day
\item level of social engagement
\item website errors
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{2. Game Designer Efficiency}

\emph{How efficient is it to design a game using the serious game
  framework?}

SGSEEM measures game designer efficiency through how much time it takes
to design the game, and how many errors the designers encountered during
the design process.  The serious game framework normally provides
certain tools or interfaces for the designers to design the game. This
may involve configuring global settings for the game, such as how long
will the game run, who are the players, and how to design individual
game elements.

SGSEEM proposes to first identify the list of design tasks, then look at
two set of data to assess the game designer's efficiency. One set of
data is the admin log data for the interaction between the game designer
and the serious game framework. From these log data, we can derive the
time it took a designer to complete a certain design task using the game
framework, and any system error he or she encountered. Another set of
data is obtained by interviewing the designers to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How much time did you spend to complete each design task?
    \item What problems did you encounter?
    \item Did you find it difficult to configure? What was difficult?
    \item Did you find it difficult to design a specific game? Which
      one, and what was difficult?
    \item What did you like the least when using the system?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{3. Game Manager Efficiency}

\emph{How efficient is it to manage the game using the serious game
  framework?}

To investigate how efficient it is to manage a game, we look at
how much time it takes to manage the game, and how many errors the
game managers encountered during the process. Serious game
frameworks normally provide certain interfaces for the managers to
manage the game. This may involve managing player submissions,
monitoring the game state, entering manual resource data, notifying
winners of the game, etc.

SGSEEM proposes to first identify the list of management tasks, then
analyze two sets of data to assess the game manager's efficiency. The
first set of data is the admin log data for the interaction between
the game manager and the serious game framework. From these log data,
we can derive the time it took a manager to complete a certain
managing task using the interface, and any system error he or she
encountered. The second set of data will be obtained by interviewing
the managers to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item How much time did you spend to complete each managing task?
\item What problems did you encounter?
\item Did you find it difficult to manage? What was difficult?
\item What did you like the least when using the system?
\end{itemize}

It is possible that the same people share the role of game manager and
game designer, for example, the game designer also manages the
game. In this case, the evaluation looks at the same person's
data, both admin log and interview, with different assessing
questions.

\subsubsection{4. System Admin Efficiency}

\emph{How efficient is it to install and maintain the system?}

To investigate how efficient it is to install and maintain
the game, we look at how much time it takes to install and
maintain the game, and how many errors encountered during the
process. To investigate these two areas we will interview the system
admin to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item How much time did you spend to install the system?
\item How much time did you spend to maintain the system?
\item What problems did you encounter?
\item Did you find it difficult to admin the system? What was difficult?
\item What did you like the least about administering the system?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{5. Developer Efficiency}

\emph{How efficient is it to understand, extend, and debug the system?}

To investigate how efficient it is to understand, extend, and debug the
system, we look at how much time it takes to develop an
enhancement to the game framework, and how many errors are encountered
during the process. We interview the developer(s) to
answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item How much time did you spend to set up the development
  environment?
\item How much time did you spend developing and debugging an
  enhancement to the game framework?
\item What problem(s) did you encounter?
\item Did you find it difficult to understand, extend and debug the
  system? What was difficult?
\item What did you like the least when developing the game
  enhancement? 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{6. Researcher Efficiency}

\emph{How efficient is it to conduct research with the system?}

To investigate how efficient it is to do research with the system, we
look at how much time it takes to use the system for specific research
queries, and how many errors are encountered during the process. We
interview the researcher(s) to answer the following questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item How much time did you spend to collect the research data for a
  specific topic?
\item What problems did you encounter when collecting the data?
\item Did you find the data you collected helpful to your research? If
  not, what can be improved?
\item Did you find it difficult to collect data from the system?
  What was difficult?
\item What did you like the least about using the system?
\end{itemize}

\section{Case Study of Makahiki}

Now that we have described SGSEEM, this section will discuss
a case study of how we applied SGSEEM to evaluate the Makahiki serious
game framework for sustainability. First we will first describe the
Makahiki framework.

\subsection{Makahiki in Brief}

We have developed an innovative serious game framework for sustainability
called Makahiki. It is an IT infrastructure for the development of
sustainability challenges. Makahiki explores one section of the design
space where virtual world game mechanics are employed to affect real
world sustainability behaviors.

Makahiki consists of a configurable game framework that can be customized
to the needs of different organizations. It includes a library of
pre-built game ``widgets'' that implement a variety of game mechanics.
Using the widgets, an organization can create a custom energy % CAM:
                                % we suddenly switch from
                                % sustainability to energy.
challenge in which players can compete individually or in teams to
earn the most points by reducing their energy consumption as well as
by learning about energy concepts in general. \autoref{fig:makahiki-architecture} illustrates the architecture of
Makahiki. \autoref{fig:makahiki-games} shows a few examples of the
games implemented in the Makahiki game library. More detailed
description of Makahiki can be found here~\cite{csdl2-12-06}.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Experiences with Makahiki}

We have used Makahiki in the real world to create four different Kukui
Cup Energy Challenges. Kukui Cup Energy challenges were held at the
University of Hawaii (UH) in 2011 and 2012 for over 1,000 first
year students living in the residence halls. Hawaii Pacific University
(HPU) held a Kukui Cup Energy challenge in Fall 2012 for about 200
students. An international organization called the East-West Center
(EWC) held a Kukui Cup Energy and Water challenge for the
international residents living in the residence halls without smart
meters, so the resource consumption data had to be entered by the game
mangers manually.

The successful creation of serious game challenges by three different
organizations provides evidence that the Makahiki serious game framework
can be tailored to the needs of different organizations. First, UH uses
smart meters by Electro-Industries Inc., while HPU uses smart meters by
EGauge Inc., and EWC collected their energy data manually. Second, while
UH and HPU challenges involved only energy consumption data, the EWC
challenge involved both energy and water consumption data (which was
also collected manually). Third, the IT infrastructure at UH and HPU
provided authentication services using CAS (Central Authentication
Service) and LDAP, while EWC used the built-in Django authentication.
Fourth, the user interface was customized to ``brand'' each challenge
with the logo, thematic elements, and the education contents of the
sponsoring organizations.

Besides the real world usage of Makahiki in the series of Kukui Cup
challenges, we also performed in-lab evaluation experiments. Makahiki
was used in a serious game development course at the University of
Hawaii Information and Computer Sciences department. The students were senior undergraduates or graduate students. During the course, the students 
installed Makahiki, configured and designed a serious game instance with
Makahiki, and finally developed an enhancement to the Makahiki
framework. We asked the students taking the course to voluntarily
participate in the evaluation experiments of Makahiki, using SGSEEM.

\subsection{Evaluation of Makahiki}

This section describes the details of Makahiki evaluation using SGSEEM.

\subsubsection{Player Effectiveness}

We evaluated player effectiveness using the 2012 Kukui Cup Challenge at
the University of Hawaii at Manoa. There were over 1000 eligible players
for this challenge, who were mostly first year college students living
in a cluster of four similar structured resident halls. Makahiki
recorded detailed logging data from every interaction between the
players and the website.

\emph{To what extend does the game increase player's literacy in
  sustainability?}

We conducted the two surveys, one before the challenge (pre-game) and
one after the challenge (post-game). The players' sustainability
literacy and behavior change was:
% CAM: need to put in some preliminary results.

\emph{To what extent does the game produce positive player behavior
  change in sustainability?}

The energy consumption data before, during and after the challenge were
examined to understand any usage pattern or reduction during and after
the challenge. The results were:
% CAM: need to put in some preliminary results.

\emph{To what extent does the game engage players?}

We calculated the engagement metrics and the results were:
% CAM: need to put in some preliminary results.


\subsubsection{Game Manager Efficiency Evaluation}

Game manager efficiency evaluation was performed by interviewing the
game managers of the Hawaii Pacific University and East-West Center at
Hawaii challenges. The interviews took place after the challenge. We
asked them about their experiences in using the Makahiki admin
interface for the managing process during the challenge. The admin
interface log data was also analyzed to assess if there were any errors
encountered during challenge management.
% CAM: need to put in some preliminary results.


\subsubsection{System Admin Efficiency Evaluation}

System admin efficiency evaluation was performed using student assignments. Students were tasked with installing the Makahiki
system into their local computers as well as the cloud environment. In
order to understand how much time it takes to install the Makahiki and
what problems might be encountered, We designed a Google Form which
details the steps of installing Makahiki both locally and in the
cloud, and for each step, we asked the students to record the time
they spent and the problems they encountered.

\autoref{fig:makahiki-eval-form} illustrates a partial Google Form
used for Makahiki system admin evaluation.

We also asked the students to provide feedback about their
installation experiences in the form of blog posts.

\subsubsection{Game Designer Efficiency Evaluation}

Another class assignment for students was to design a Kukui-Cup-like
serious game using Makahiki. We asked the students to follow specific
design steps and record the time required and any problems encountered during
their design process.

Students were also asked to provide feedback about their design
experiences in the form of blog posts.

Game designer efficiency evaluation was also performed by interviewing
the game designers of the Hawaii Pacific University and East-West
Center challenges. The interviews took place before the
challenge started to capture their experiences in using the Makahiki
admin interface for the design process, which normally happens before
the challenge. We analyzed both the qualitative data collected from
the interviews and email exchanges with the game managers, and the
quantitative collected from the admin interface log data.

\subsubsection{Developer Efficiency Evaluation}

In another assignment in the serious games class, the students were
tasked with developing an enhancement to Makahiki. This
involved setting up a development environment, following the tutorial
to create a "Hello world" widget using Makahiki, and finally,
developing an enhancement which extended the functionality of Makahiki.

The students were asked to submit their development source code to the
public source code repository (GitHub) and write a blog post to
discuss their efforts to complete the development activity.

We reviewed their source code to compare their code to a reference
implementation, analyzed the blog posts from the students, as well as
any email correspondence from students discussing problems they encountered.
% CAM: need to put in some preliminary results.

\subsubsection{Researcher Experience Evaluation}

We interviewed the researchers using the University of Hawaii
instance.
% CAM: need to put in some preliminary results.

\section{Future Work}

The development of SGSEEM creates another research question:
what are the strengths and weaknesses of this evaluation method itself? To
answer that question, we are planing to apply the evaluation framework
to another serious game framework.
%(such as the commercial Lucid Dashboard system~\cite{building-dashboard})
With the insights gained from another case study, SGSEEM can be further
improved.

One area of effectiveness evaluation that is currently not addressed in
SGSEEM: the longitudinal evaluation of player effectiveness. It would be
very useful to determine whether the serious game experience actually
had lasting impacts on players. In the context of Makahiki-based serious
games for sustainability, this would include things such as whether the
student players were able to continue any positive sustainability
behaviors after leaving their residence halls.

\section{Conclusion}

We have developed a serious game framework evaluation method called
Serious Game Stakeholder Experience Evaluation Method (SGSEEM). SGSEEM
evaluates serious game frameworks from the perspective of different
stakeholders' experiences: player effectiveness, game designer
efficiency, game manager efficiency, system administrator efficiency,
developer efficiency, and researcher efficiency. These experiences are
evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively to evaluate the serious game
framework.

We also applied the SGSEEM evaluation mechanism to Makahiki. The results
show that ...
