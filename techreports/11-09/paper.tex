% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no

% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


\usepackage{mdwmath}
\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.

%% Package to linebreak URLs in a sane manner.
\usepackage{url}
%% Define a new 'smallurl' style for the package that will use a smaller font.
\makeatletter
\def\url@smallurlstyle{%
  \@ifundefined{selectfont}{\def\UrlFont{\sf}}{\def\UrlFont{\small\ttfamily}}}
\makeatother
%% Now actually use the newly defined style.
\urlstyle{smallurl}
%% Define 'tinyurl' style for even smaller URLs (such as in tables)
\makeatletter
\def\url@tinyurlstyle{%
  \@ifundefined{selectfont}{\def\UrlFont{\sf}}{\def\UrlFont{\scriptsize\ttfamily}}}
\makeatother



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
Android OS is an open-source Linux-based operating system for mobile devices developed by 
Open Handset Alliance. Its SCM log was selected as a research subject for 
the 2012 MSR Challenge.
I attempted to apply a novel data mining technique based on SAX approximation and indexing 
of time-series with $TF\ast IDF$ weights in order to discover recurrent behaviors within 
the Android OS development process. 

By mining software process artifact trails corresponding to OMAP kernel development, 
I was able to discover recurrent behaviors in the ``new code lines dynamics'' before and after
release. By building a classifier upon these behaviors I was able to successfully recognize 
pre- and post-release behaviors within the same and similar sub-projects of Android OS.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
As with many other large open-source projects, Android OS has been in the development for many years. 
Android is ``an open-source software stack for mobile phones and other devices'',
\url{http://source.android.com/} which is based on the Linux 2.6 monolithic kernel.
Development of Android was begun by Android Inc., the small startup company.
In 2005, the company was acquired by Google which formed the Open Handset Alliance - a consortium of 84 companies 
which announced the availability of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) 
in November 2007. The Android OS code is open and released under the Apache License.

Git is used as a version control system for Android and the source code is is organized 
into more than 200 of sub-projects by function (kernel, UI, mailing system, etc.) 
and underlying hardware (CPU type, bluetooth communication chip, etc.). 
There are about two million change records registered in the Android SCM by more than 
eleven thousands of contributors within an eight year span.

By the large body of previous research, it has been shown that change metadata is a rich 
source of software process and developers' social characteristics. The ability to discover
recurrent behaviors with Fourier Analysis of change events is 
explained in \cite{citeulike:10377345} along with other work, such as \cite{citeulike:10392277}
that relates activity time patterns and software product quality. Thus, potentially,
it is possibile to relate recurrent behaviors to software product 
quality and to software process efficiency. The first part of a toolkit
aiding such a research is an efficient mechanism to discover recurrent behaviors
modulated by social and project-related constraints. In this paper I extend 
previous research by introducing a universal framework for temporal 
partitioning and mining of software change artifacts and evaluate this
fremework on the Android SCM data. 

\section{Contribution}
To the best of my knowledge, this work is the first attempt to study the applicability
of symbolic aggregate approximation and term frequency\textendash document frequency
weight statistics to the mining of software process artifacts. 
This methodology has a number of advantages. First of all, SAX facilitates significant 
reduction of the large complexity (dimensionality and noise) of temporal artifacts 
and opens the door to application of a phetora of strings and text-mining algorithms.
In addition, the TF$\ast$IDF statistics provides an efficient mechanism for 
discrimination of the signal by ranking text data. Finally the third component I have 
used - the relational database - facilitates efficient data slicing, indexing,
and retrieval.

As an example of a possible data-mining workflow demonstrating the resolving power 
and correctness of the approach, I present a case study of building a classifier
for pre- and post-release recurrent behaviors. 
Whereas this classifier demonstrates a good performance within the project it was 
trained on with less than 20\% miss-classification, it has less than 15\% 
miss-classification rate in similar Android OS kernel sub-projects.

\section{Motivation}
Software development is a human activity resulting in a software product. The 
amount of time and effort needed to complete a software project and the 
quality of the final product affected by software
process. Thus, studying software processes is one of the important areas of
software engineering. 

Previously it was found that software development, as many other human activities,
could be successfully partitioned by the time of the day reflecting our lifestyle and habits
\cite{citeulike:10396459} \cite{citeulike:10392305}. However external constraints, 
such as employment and management constraints \cite{citeulike:6095797}, 
software release cycle \cite{citeulike:2739216} have been found to be able 
to significantly alter natural activity patterns. Furthermore, within open-source 
projects with a diverse development community scattered over the globe and 
often following undocumented development process \cite{citeulike:10377366}, natural human 
activity cycles are often discarded and development and release cycles are significantly altered.
Thus, the only feasible way to discover an open-source software process is to analyze 
its artifacts trails such as SCM logs, bug and issue tracking systems and 
mailing lists archives. Essentially these trails are event-series where every 
time-stamped event has an attached set of metadata. 
However the complexity of this data and the precision of the process 
recall impose a great challenge for researchers.

These challenges are not new to the data-mining community and an enormous wealth 
of methods, algorithms and data structures have been developed to address these issues.
While some of these approaches were already implemented within the MSR framework 
such as finding of trends, periodicity and recurrent behaviors through the linear 
predictive coding and cepstrum coefficients \cite{citeulike:3378725}, 
Fourier Transform \cite{citeulike:10377345} and coding \cite{citeulike:10377366},
many are yet to be tried.

In this paper, I investigate the application of 
Symbolic Aggregate Approximation \cite{citeulike:2821475} and the TF$\ast$IDF 
statistics \cite{citeulike:3056638} to the problem of discovering recurrent 
behaviors from software process artifacts with application to Android SCM data.

\section{Research question}
In this exploratory work I am investigating the applicability of Lin\&Keogh \cite{citeulike:2821475} 
symbolic approximation technique to the discovery of recurrent behaviors from SCM trails 
of Android OS.
The research questions I am addressing are: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item Which kinds of SCM data need to be collected for such analyzes?
 \item What is the optimal approach to data representation and a data storage configuration?
 \item Which partitioning (slicing) is appropriate and which set of parameters should one use for SAX approximation?
 \item Which distance metrics serves best for measuring similarity and dissimilarity?
 \item What is the general mining workflow, and which parameters are crucial for result?
\end{itemize}

\section{Experimental setup and methods}
\subsection{Data collection and organization}
Two XML files were offered for the MSR challenge. These contain the most of the information obtainable 
from Google-hosted git source code repository as well as from bug and issue tracking system.
While the issues and comment XML file contains nearly all information available in repository, 
the change XML provided for this challenge contains only a fraction of all of the information.

The thirteen data fields of the change trail XML file provide information about the revision 
tree, author and a committer identification, change message and affected targets. 
Since I am focusing on the mining of temporal patterns for inferring recurrent behaviors, 
in addition to the existing data I have collected additional auxiliary data about change. By creating
a local mirror and by iterating over existing commit hashes I was able to recover the auxiliary 
data for 68\% of existing commits. The remaining 32\% of change information is irretrievable and 
belongs to legacy projects or is lost and unrecoverable due to the changes in Android repository. 

For every recoverable change record I collected a summary of added, modified and deleted files 
as well as a summary about LOC changes: added, modified or deleted lines. All this information 
was stored in the database backend. Main tables of this database correspond to change 
and issue events; these accompanied with change target table, issue, comments and 
tables for contributors. Overall, the database was normalized and optimized for the fast 
retrieval of change and issue information using SQL language.

\subsection{Temporal data partitioning}
Following the previous research \cite{citeulike:10392277}, I have partitioned the 
change trails by the time of the day using time windows of
\begin{itemize}
 \item Full day, 12AM - 12AM
    \item Late night, 12AM - 04AM  
    \item Early morning, 04AM - 08AM  
    \item Day, 08AM - 05PM  
    \item Night, 05PM - 12AM
\end{itemize}
then aggregated within these windows values for commits, added/edited/deleted 
lines and targets. By having such a table it takes a fractions of a second to retrieve 
a summary of early morning added lines for January 2007 for a particular sub-project and
a group of contributors having emails with a domain ``...@ibm.com''.

\subsection{Symbolic approximation and indexing}
SAX algorithm requires three input parameters where first is the sliding window size, 
second is the PAA approximation size, and the third parameter is the SAX Alphabet size.

In this work I experimented with three sizes for sliding window reflecting natural 
intervals: a week (7 days), two weeks (14 days) and a month (30 days).
For the PAA reduction I chose size 4 for 7 days window, size 6 for a bi-weekly interval,
and 10 PAA steps for a monthly window. Finally, for the alphabet, I used 3 letters for 
weekly window, 5 letters for bi-weekly and 7 for monthly windows.

By applying SAX to the pre-aggregated streams I obtained their symbolic representation
which I stored in a MySQL database organized and indexed to allow fast 
retrieval of symbolic data for a specific SAX parameters set, a project, a contributor, 
or a time-interval or any combination of these fields .

\subsection{Token-based distance metrics}
For the experiments I selected three similarity metrics which were used to compare 
vectors of SAX words frequencies for selected entities or their sets. Each of these
vectors is two-dimensional and consists of the 
pairs $\{\langle word\rangle,\langle word \: frequency\rangle\}$

For distance, I experimented with a weighted by SAX Euclidean 
distance between frequencies of common to two sets words:
\begin{equation}
D(S,T) = \sqrt{ \sum_{S\cap T} (SAXdist(s_{i},t_{i}) * \lVert F_{s_{i}}-F_{t_{i}} \rVert )^{2}  }
\end{equation} 

The second distance I tried is the Jaccard similarity coefficient between two 
sets $S$ and $T$ which is simply 
\begin{equation}
J_{\delta}(S,T) = \frac{|S\cup T| - |S\cap T|}{|S\cup T|}
\end{equation} 

The third distance is the $TF\ast IDF$ similarity which defined as a dot product 
\begin{equation}
 TFIDF(S,T) = \sum_{\omega \in S \cap T} V(\omega, S) \cdot V(\omega, T)
\end{equation} 
where 
\begin{equation}
 V(\omega, S) = \frac { V^{\prime} (\omega,S) } { \sqrt{ \sum_{\omega^{\prime}} V^{\prime} (\omega,S)^{2}} }
\end{equation} 
is a normalization of $TF\ast IDF$ (product of token frequency and inverse document frequency):
\begin{equation}
 V^{\prime} (\omega,S) = \log(TF_{\omega, S} +1) \cdot \log(IDF_{\omega})
\end{equation} 
where $IDF_{\omega}$ is a measure of the general importance of the pattern among all users
\begin{equation}
 IDF_{\omega} = \frac{|D|}{DF(\omega)}
\end{equation} 
where $|D|$ is cardinality of $D$ - the total number of users, and $DF(\omega)$ is the number of users having $\omega$ pattern in their activity set.

\section{Clustering}
As a universal tool for the exploration of derived pattern dictionaries through their partitioning, 
and for assessment of the metrics' performance, I used hierarchical clustering. The k-means
clustering was used in the validation of the class assignment and for general assessment of 
the validity of the approach.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Kernel-OMAP life cycle patterns discovery}
I arbitrary selected the Android kernel-OMAP as one of the large Android OS sub-projects. 
OMAP is a proprietary system on chips (SoCs) for portable and mobile multimedia applications 
based on general-purpose ARM architecture processor provided by Texas Instruments.

As a training set for building dictionaries of pre- and post-release patterns, I chose three Android releases:
\textit{Android 1.0}, \textit{Android 1.5} and \textit{Android 2.0}. For each of these I generated
SAX words dictionaries corresponding to four weeks before the release - \textit{pre-release}, and to four 
weeks after release - \textit{post-release}.

After a number of clustering experiments, from three selected metrics only $TF\ast IDF$ demonstrated an 
acceptable performance when applied to weekly aggregated time-intervals of one month before the release 
and one month after release.

As an additional constraint for this experiment, I put the restriction on contributors, 
selecting affiliated with $google.com$ e-mail domain only, and on the telemetry stream of $added\_lines$.
The almost perfect clustering picture (Figure \ref{fig:kernel_cluster}) obtained with hierarchical 
clustering and $TF\ast IDF$ similarity measure indicates that there are significant differences 
in the pre- and post-release weekly behaviors of contributors in selected time-windows.

While hierarchical clustering is a good sanity test for the data exploration, the performance of K-means 
clustering is much more valuable \cite{citeulike:3562}. I performed k-means on the symbolic 
representation of data using $TF\ast IDF$ statistics and Euclidean distance. The algorithm converged after two
iterations separating pre- and post-release dictionaries with a single mismatch for the Android 2.0 pre-release.

By using centroids of two resulting clusters as a basis for pre- and post-release patterns I tested 
the classifier on the rest of Android releases for which kernel-OMAP remained an active project
(some of the pre- and post- release interval contained none or only trivial patterns making them
ineligible for classification). This classifier was able to successfully classify more than 81\% 
of pre- and post-release behaviors (Table \ref{tab:success}). When applied to the similar project -
kernel-TEGRA - it demonstrated the error rate less than 15\%.

The classifier demonstrated a weak, almost random performance on other sub-projects. 
However, when re-trained on the platform-external-bluetooth-bluez, its performance on other bluetooth
sub-projects such as platform-external-bluetooth-glib, platform-external-bluetooth-hcidump and
platform-system-bluetooth recovered to 20\% missclassification.

\section{Discussion}
The presented approach and workflow employs two novel techniques in order to discover and 
rank recurrent behaviors from software process artifact trails. While the approach 
demonstrates satisfactory performance, the interpretation of the captured behaviors requires
more work. The discovered behaviors are organized in Table \ref{tab:tokens} by their 
occurence: the first three columns belong to the post-release time-window while
the four next columns belong to pre-release time-window, the rest are the behaviors observed 
in both. It seems that during pre-release most of the added lines within a week fall on the 
Monday and Tuesday, whereas during post-release time, most of the lines are added during the 
end of the week and the week-end.
