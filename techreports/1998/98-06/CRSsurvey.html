<LI>The page has all the information that you could want on one page. You are allowed to immediately branch to whatever information it is that you need.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Cons:</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>Their logo, while colorful, is not clear. If you are going to go through the effort of loading something, it should be worth the wait time.</LI>
<LI>There is a lot of information on the main page - this is not a problem because it is all in text and loads very quickly. The problem is that if your informational link was located at the end of the page, you would need to scroll down the entire page before you found it (actually, most of the links are located at the end of the document).</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>This site seems to be more of a summary of the group - there was not too much that I could click around to. This seems to be common in quite a few of the sites that I have visited. If the site were more comprehensive, you could get a better feel for the group.</P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>
<P>I like the fact that the branching is very quick. If we can do the CSDL site in such a way that you branch immediately in a manner that is not too abrupt (see the <a href="http://wwwagse.informatik.uni-kl.de/frame.html"> Software Engineering Research Group at the University of Kaiserslautern </a>, their branching system of the right-hand frame is really abrupt), it will help us with the problem of gearing the site to a wide variety of audiences.</P>

<P><B>Site summary:</B></P>
<P>This site utilizes mostly text. However, their information on the page is very organized. One mostly unattractive thing I found on the page was the broken link of their main logo. It somewhat altered my sympathy I have had for the site, alluding me that the site is lacked of maintenance and updated information. In the page of <A HREF="http://www.arc.umn.edu/news/">http://www.arc.umn.edu/news/</A>, there are quite a number of pictures to be shown on one page, making the page long, unattractive and slow in loading. Showing thumbnails of the pictures is a better alternative.</P>

<P><B>Site summary:</B></P>
<P>The left navigational bar on the left is attractive and representing the group&#146;s mission. Yet it does take a while to fully load on a 28.8 kps Modem. So viewers need to wait until the loading is done before jumping to another page. This is an unfriendly feature that we can avoid. A solution to this problem could the availability of a text links at the bottom of the page. In the recruiting page, it is always better and courteous to mention the name of the contact person, an obvious gain for the communication between prospective employees and employer.</P>

<LI>My first reaction to the site is pretty good; it&#146;s something I would expect from a Multimedia Research Center. Nice graphics, modern colors (a bit hard on the eyes, but that&#146;s the trend now), and the formatting of the text blends nicely with the overall appearance.</LI>
<LI>The site information page : <A HREF="http://www-plateau.cs.berkeley.edu/info/index.html">http://www-plateau.cs.berkeley.edu/info/index.html</A>. It explains about the site, what to expect, and because of the multimedia used here, it informs the user about the type of file formats in the site. </LI>
<LI>The navigation through this site is great; subheadings throughout the pages are linked at the side for quick access, and this is done without the need for frames.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Cons:</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>Although there is a text-version of the bottom image map, there is nothing to supplement the top image map. Although some of the links at the top image map are repeated at the bottom, there are some which are not, leaving the few who visit this site text-only to miss out on some sections.</LI>
<LI>Some of the pages could have been split up a bit more. The &quot;What is BMRC&quot; page, <A HREF="http://www-plateau.cs.berkeley.edu/info/whatisbmrc.html">http://www-plateau.cs.berkeley.edu/info/whatisbmrc.html</A>, is very long, and although it features linked subheadings (see Pros #3), reading through all of the page is tiring.</LI>
<LI>The &quot;Media Editing Procedures&quot; page, <A HREF="http://www-plateau.cs.berkeley.edu/info/procedures/">http://www-plateau.cs.berkeley.edu/info/procedures/</A>,  was quite a jump backwards. They could have at least made the background color the same. It gives a feeling of neglect for the site.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>I really like the design of this site&#151;it&#146;s modern looking, but it doesn&#146;t take a long time to load the graphics. The designers made a great balance between the speed and looks for this site, something all sites should follow. Because of its great looks, it makes the group sound like something really exciting, instead of just another boring research group. Navigation around this site was fairly good, but some sections were very long, making it hard to look through. They do have a search engine, but it would have been nice if they offered other ways of categorizing their links. There is some documentation on the site itself, but only after you get there through the main page, which has none. I give this site an 8 out of 10.</P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>
<P>The first page seen by the user is very important--it makes the first impression. This page should look excellent (if not all of the pages), in order to draw the person in, and have them look further through the page.</P>

<LI>A good search engine located directly on the first page, made for those who know the site, but don&#146;t know where to find that particular document.</LI>
<LI>Good use of graphics and theme throughout the pages. The sub-pages seem together with the main page because of the same theme used throughout the site. </LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Cons:</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>The requirement for either Postscript or PDF readers. There should have been an HTML equivalent for the reports contained, since this is the WWW.</LI>
<LI>At smaller resolutions, the main text of the page isn&#146;t visible until scrolling down. </LI>
<LI>There is a lack of information on the page. For instance, the Sketch page, <A HREF="http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/research/sketch/">http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/research/sketch/</A>, only gives a brief overview of the Sketch concept, and related links, but no real information on the project. </LI>
<LI>Bad server. While visiting the site, I was often unable to load sections because of the server having problems. I would visit a page, and when trying again, would be unable to view it again.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>I was not able to look through this site too thoroughly because of the server being ineffective at doing its job. The server went down twice in the five minutes I spent trying to view the site. If I was not specifically looking for this site, I would have given up by now. However, the site seems small, having only four main projects, but still there is not much information given on these sections. Many of the links to the major information require additional plug-ins, such as Adobe Acrobat, and although I tried viewing one, the server went down, and I was unable to do so. It seems that this site started out ambitiously, but peaked out before it was finished, as there is a very incomplete feel about this site. However, I can&#146;t really judge too well, as I was not able to view the site in its entirety. </P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>
<P>This is a good example of using colors without using large graphics and of giving the effect of frames without really using frames.</P>

<LI>For the use of only two colors, the design is fairly effective. </LI>
<LI>The site is explained on the main page, with link buttons on the side providing quick access to the sections contained.</LI>
<LI>Mini-logo used as link returning to home page helps keep the site together.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Cons:</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>There is no alternative given form the main link buttons, neither is an &lt;ALT&gt; tag given for these images.</LI>
<LI>Many of the sections are not explained, both on the main page, and in the section. While looking through these links, I wasn&#146;t sure what I was looking at until around three levels into the site.</LI>
<LI>The individual research project pages are very different from each other.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>It took some looking through the site to determine what kind of laboratory this was. This site is very minimal, seeming to offering information only to those who know what they are looking for. Most of the sections only consist of the title and a listing of links; the one exception was the Research Facilities page (<A HREF="http://www.cclrc.ac.uk/Facilities/index.html">http://www.cclrc.ac.uk/Facilities/index.html</A>) which had a nice description of their projects. However, upon visiting these links, I found many different styles of pages, which gave me the idea that these projects were totally unrelated to each other, and that this grouping together into a site was merely because of geographical reasons. This may be the case, but should be something avoided in the CSDL site.</P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>
<P>A good explanation of the group should be present upon the first page. Without it, people who are actually looking for information related to CSDL may simply gloss over the site because of a misleading first page.</P>

<LI>The main page explains how to navigate through the site, which is always good when using frames.</LI>
<LI>This site has a great use of frames: it serves as a reminder of where you are, it provides quick navigation, and changes according to content when switching through sections. </LI>
<LI>A great search engine, it allows for searching via many different criteria, and also gives a listing of key words to help the user.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Cons:</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>The link to &quot;Teacher Enh.&quot; in the navigation frame. It&#146;s not apparent what &quot;Enh.&quot; stands for, so it would&#146;ve been better if they took two lines and actually wrote out &quot;Enhancement&quot;. Furthermore, once you reach the site, the frames disappear. </LI>
<LI>The links for the first CeVis <I>Research</I> page load another page with almost the same layout, but an exploded view of the section you chose. Basically, a waste of time, the exploded view of all of the research projects would have been fine, it could have been placed under the six main links if it was thought of as obtrusive. </LI>
<LI>The bottom left hand frame annoyingly has a scroll bar; if the frame was made a little bigger, or if scrollbars were taken off the frame, this wouldn&#146;t have happened.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>The CeVis site has that &quot;European Dignity&quot; feeling when first loaded. It isn&#146;t exciting, but then it isn&#146;t boring, just calmly dignified. The site could use more graphics, especially when the subject matter is complicated, such as the discussion on fractals. The use of frames is one of the better ones, as it not only unifies all of the pages with the logo at the top (although taking too much room at the top), but changes when going into a new section, making it very functional as a navigation tool. However, the annoying aspect of the bottom left frame having toolbars, and the fact that the entire page reload (as compared to just the frames reloading) when going to a new section cause a need for a little more tweaking.  The sub-pages make you work a little harder than other sites; for instance, the staff page does not automatically link you to the member&#146;s email addresses, you have to figure it out yourself using the &quot;formula&quot; for e-mail: FirstName.Lastname., and some sub-pages link only to an exploded version of itself instead of offering it as such in the beginning. The search engine (not available the second time I visited the site) was one of the best around, allowing users to search using a variety of criteria. A 7 out of 10, for good use of frames, a good search engine, but the need for a couple of tweaks.</P>

<P>The search mechanism under Publications is something we should try to copy.</P>

<P><B>Cons:</B></P>

<LI>Because the site is mostly text, it is fairly boring.</LI>
<LI>The link to one of their "major acheivements" is buried in text.</LI>
<LI>Getting to specific areas of interest is not easy. For instance, many items are buried three to four pages deep. They are too sectioned off.</LI>
<LI>They use too few graphics (a total of five buttons) to use graphics. If they are going to use them at all, they need a few more.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>The site could have been a lot better. For one thing, they could have easily gotten logos from their sponsors. That alone would have made the page much more visually appealing. The only graphics on the main page are a bunch of buttons at the bottom of the page. Being that these are the only graphics in the entire site, they appear out of place and seem to just float there. The organization of the page is also wanting. Say I wanted to find information on a fellow I knew was working on the project, first I would have to read through a page and a half of text before getting to the "People" button. From there I'm led to a page splitting up the people into four different categories. If I don't know which he fits into, I have to look in all four. Navigation through the site could be much easier.</P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>
<P>Our organization should be such that, while it is properly grouped so that information is not just run together, it is not so decompartmentalized that you cannot easily find something without previous knowledge of where it is. Again, if you are going to go all text, go all text. If you are going to use graphics, use enough so that it doesn't look like you threw in a few just to say that your site uses graphics.</P>

<LI>The tone of the site does not match at times. The Cool Demos page, <A HREF="http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/demos/">http://www-graphics.stanford.edu/demos/</A>, seems to insinuate a more casual tone, but it as boring as the rest of the site.</LI>
<LI>Links are not constant&#151;in the same list, there are links to both pages and files, without any indication of the type.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>This site starts out with a nice rendered logo at the top (although they could have centered the picture and text, and used a better font) and a nice, concise index, but from there it gets really boring. For a graphics laboratory, this site is very low on pictures, not even using a background image.  Most pages consist of just a bunch of pictures at the top, and a lot of text, which made reading hard and uninteresting. The page could have been made a lot nicer, and a lot more interesting, but because of using basically unorganized page layouts, it made this site very uninviting. About a 5 out of 10, leaning on the lower end.</P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>
<P>A large graphic on the main page that is used with matching smaller graphics on subsequent pages helps to to a large site together.</P>

<P><B>Site summary:</B></P>
<P>I like the way the first page is presented. Different aspects are divided in different tables/groups. However, the format of other pages is not consistent with the first page. The site uses a number of pictures mostly in gif file, which are not very clear and take a long time to load. I personally think, the unclarity of the pictures does not help the sites overall, in fact it could assert negative effects. Thus, the site emphasizes the importance of the decision in choosing pictures that we can show on the web. Similarly, I think the text navigational links on the left frame do not contribute anything much to the site&#146;s overall attractiveness. They should have been replaced by some graphical buttons, even just simple ones. </P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>
<P>The counter at the bottom of the left frame seems to be an old, outdated technology. We could exclude that in our new site.</P>

<P>Overall, I give this site a 6 out of 10. The graphics have a lot to work towards, but the text formatting is quite nice. The linking of sections together (see Pros #1) was a good idea, but more of this could be added. Unfortunately, the weakest part of this site are the sections on the projects itself. Most have only a short summary, with no links to anything else besides its parent page. The pages themselves look boring and thrown together, and are all different from each other. Because this is a research group, I think that more importance should have been put in the Projects section. </P>

It doesn't seem to be used by the group as a resource center, so that would limit the amount of information you could glean about the group itself. It is an information rich site, but not very user friendly. Navigation is not as easy as it could be and is rather boring. It reminds me of a hospital - sterile.  There is not much color except for white and it seems to be geared for visitors. While there are elements that make it look like it is frequently updated ("new" signs), it doesn't give off that feeling.</P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>
<P>We need to strive for balance in our pages - if we go with nice graphics, everything should be nice - we should use the same fonts and general sizes, too. We also should have a standard navigation bar that lets you jump to any topic from any place.</P>

<LI>The page at <A HREF="http://www.evl.uic.edu/EVL/EVENTS/tq97.html">http://www.evl.uic.edu/EVL/EVENTS/tq97.html</A> is a great example of a good layout. It uses two columns, which shortens the line space, making it easier to read. It also includes graphics big enough to draw attention, but small enough to load quickly.</LI>
<LI>The N.I.C.E. project, <A HREF="http://www.ice.eecs.uic.edu/~nice/NICE/intro.html">http://www.ice.eecs.uic.edu/~nice/NICE/intro.html</A>, is a great example of effective use of color. The &quot;virtual garden&quot; theme of N.I.C.E goes well with the green and brown colors, relating to nature. This portion of the site also matches the mood of the project&#151;since it was made for kids, it has a nice, playful attitude.</LI>
<LI>The main page is set up rather well. At the top are quick links to sections, followed by a detailed description of each section. Finally, a search engine is available directly on the main page, for those who still don&#146;t know which section to visit.</LI>
<LI>Overall, the site uses a good selection of color. The yellow on black format makes it less strenuous to read, causing paragraphs to seem shorter than it would if it were black on white.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Cons:</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>The pictures&#146; sizes are not written into the HTML code, so at times the page will jump after re-formatting itself when new pictures load.</LI>
<LI>The top picture leads to a site I was unable to get to otherwise. It is not said where the picture link leads, but it is displayed prominently at the top, with all the link buttons pointing to it. Somewhat confusing.</LI>
<LI>The logos for the sub-sections do not really match the main page, and furthermore, take too long to load. It&#146;s also not worth loading, as it looks only like a bunch of dots.</LI>
<LI>Some links should have been added. Because there are no links on the main page to the University of Illinois at Chicago, the lab does not seem part of the university. Also, email addresses are not linked.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>One of the better sites as regards consistency and layout. The use of dual columns in most of the pages was a nice touch; it allows for pictures to be inserted throughout the page without interrupting the flow of text, and also shortens the length of the lines of text, making it easier to read, especially when using 1024x768. The colors used were very calm, so reading the text was less strenuous than the harsh black on white that most other pages used. The sub pages&#146; design matched the main page, and this helped unite the entire site together, even though the tone of the writing changed (and in a good way) such as in the N.I.C.E. project page. Navigation was somewhat tricky, however, as most pages only linked back to the main page instead of the page that called it. Some links were needed as well, for instance, the email addresses for the members were not linked (in their individual pages). Also, the main page did not give enough information on the group, so unless you were looking specifically for the group, you would not bother looking further into the site unless you were interested in the graphic at the top. Overall, with a little cleaning, and maybe new graphics, this site can be great, and so I give it an 7 out of 10. </P>

<LI>Once you find it, the content is great here. Instead of just telling the audience what the group studies, this site teaches the audience.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Cons:</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>Looks like the group used someone else&#146;s graphics. The &quot;New!&quot; bullets are really degraded, and definitely meant for a white background (white halo around image from transparent GIF format), which my browser was not set for. At least clean it up, or make a new image.</LI>
<LI>The main page is dedicated to the new areas of the site, but leaves the other major sections in a simple text-only line at the bottom of the page. There should be more importance to the links to these sections, if not better formatting, maybe more graphics to balance out the bullets used at the top. </LI>
<LI>Basically, this site is pretty drab. There are many places where it can be improved, but ironically, this site does not do so.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>This site is great on content, but not much else. The first page of this site just hides the amount of information one can find by browsing further. Not only does this site cater those looking specifically for information on the group, but it also provides information for almost anyone, greatly increasing the size of the audience. But the one problem present, which destroys everything, is the interface. The first page includes links to its new sections, but treats the rest of the site (its major sections) as nothing, leaving it as a one line, text-only, row of links. Clicking on these links brings up the sections, which have a distinct twist on the main logo, and this could have been a great way to differentiate and display these sections on the main page. Unfortunately, the only graphics on this page are the top banner logos, and the degraded looking &quot;New!&quot; bullet that&#146;s used basically everywhere. Because of that, I give this site a 5 out of 10. </P>
<P>On a side note, the information presented here can help our project a lot, I advise everyone to at least browse over it. </P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>

<LI>Many spelling errors. While this can be attributed to the author being from a foreign country (I didn&#146;t notice any obvious spelling errors on the French page), it seems as if the page were first written in English, and then translated, due to the English found at the bottom of the French page.</LI>
<LI>Very boring layout. One &quot;graphic&quot;, which was only of text, and regular horizontal-rule separated lists of links.</LI>
<LI>Some of the Contents links, <A HREF="http://www.dice.ucl.ac.be/lab.html">http://www.dice.ucl.ac.be/lab.html#Staff</A>,  lead to a section directly below itself. Seems like a waste of a link.</LI>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>This site seems incomplete, a fact that they state at the beginning of their page. Although offering English and French pages, I found that the two languages were intermixed between the two. For example, the UCL <A HREF="http://www.ac.ucl.ac.be/spe/phone.html">phone book</A> linked directly to an all French page, but there was English descriptions under the Quelques pointeurs utiles (Some useful links) section in the French page. This I found very distracting. Given also the fact that the site is very boring, with almost no graphics, it gives me no incentive to look further into the links given. The information given was very scant otherwise. A 2 out of 10.</P>

<LI>They have links to other institutions in the area that they are	working with.</LI>
<LI>The black and white design is really striking. It also makes the little patches of color (buttons and flags) that they use stand out and look more effective.</LI>
<LI>Cool little flags are used to give more information about links. For instance, links to pages written in German have German flags next to them. There is an easy to find legend at the bottom of the page.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Cons:</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>There are so many buttons that it gets confusing. Unlike the flags, which have an easy-to-spot legend, the buttons are just there. There is no explanation of where they go. After clicking around a few times, I realized it takes you up and down one section in the page. The problem was that the sections were so close together that it was jumping the page up about four lines and it wasn't clear what the buttons were doing. They were more confusing than helpful. Anchoring is a good tool, but it can be harmful when improperly used.</LI>
<LI>This is something that I can't quite put my finger on. This site's main page doesn't really talk about itself. You need to click on a side frame to get any information at all on the group. Also, they don't tell you this on the main page, so you end up scrolling down only to find that the page abruptly ends. You go to the side frame in confusion because you don't know what else to do.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Site Summary:</B></P>
<P>Graphically this is a pretty cool site. The look is striking -- mostly black and white. The small bits of color in the small flags and icons add spice and keep the site from being boring - it has an elegant look. Unfortunately, linking to the actual meat of the site is done in the side frame. The only links found on the main page are to other places. It is disconcerting because it is such an unusual way to link things. Something just doesn't feel right.</P>

<P><B>Application for CSDL:</B></P>
<P>I would like for us to use the small icons to convey additional information <i>but only where appropriate</i>. Also, as this site illustrates, we should be careful how we use anchors and navigational icons. If there will be buttons to move you through the site, they need to be clearly labeled and take you somewhere significant. Also, if we use frames for easy navigation, the process should be explained somewhere on the main page, or we need to make the frame an integral part of the page that isn't overlooked. At any rate, the page should have a natural feel and flow. It can be new and different but it should not be strange.</P>

However, their project pages seem to try and come across as being profession, but this may never be reached if professionals are thrown off by the first impression.

<H2>SUMMARY</H2>

<H3>General Design:</H3>
<P>The CSDL site should have a great looking first page, in order to draw the audience further into the site. Frames are not a necessary item in order for the page to look high tech. Frames can be synthesized by use of tables, which also offer the advantage of being able to be resized and centered in a page, lessening the amount of information lost if a browser were to be resized. Great information is useless unless the audience can find it. The site should explain the sections of itself so that people can navigate through the site easier. As for the esthetic qualities, the site should not go overboard with the graphics; the use of small icons to convey additional information (when appropriate) can be a nice touch.</P>

<H3>Unity of the Site:</H3>
<P>Especially because CSDL is a collaborative group, the individual pages in the site should look like they belong together. A color and font scheme should be used and kept throughout the site. If a large banner graphic is used on the main page, this can be shrunk and used in the child pages, perhaps as a link back to the main page. Lastly, a constant header and footer can keep the site together.</P>

<H3>User Friendliness:</H3>
<P>If a site is not easy to navigate through, then the user often will not bother. Branching out from the main page should be carefully balanced. It should not immediately end up to documents, but it also should not force users to look through five menus to find the information needed. If many pictures are going to be provided, thumbnails should be used. Furthermore, if graphical links are present, text alternative links should always be given.  We also should have a standard navigation bar that lets you jump to any topic from any where within the site.  Finally, be certain that all links given end up somewhere. A broken link gives a very bad impression.</P>

<H3>Technology:</H3>
<P>Going through the pages displayed certain technologies that may be used in the site. The CeVis search engine is one that could be copied, giving the user many ways in which to search for documents. However, counters seem to be an old, outdated technology. We could exclude that in our new site.</P>
