<a name="introduction"><H2>Introduction</H2></a>

The CSDL (Cooperative Software Development Laboratory)
WWW site is the main interface between CSDL and the world.
CSDL is unhappy with its current site and has commissioned
the 691 Web Development Team to design and implement a new website.


<a name="purpose"><h3>Purpose</h3></a>
The purpose of this document is to:
<ol>
<li> Summarize the results of our background research for the
     CSDL web site </li>
<li> Describe the resulting requirements  </li>
</ol>

The people we expect to read and/or use this document are:
<ol>
<li> Philip Johnson (management) </li>
<li> Other CSDL members who are interested in our work and may 
     wish to provide feedback </li>
<li> Ourselves (development team) as we work on the web site </li>
</ol>


<a name="scope"><h3>Scope</h3></a>
These are the members of the ICS 691 Web Development Team:
<ol>
<li><a href="mailto:anne@ics.hawaii.edu">Anne Disney</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:tuanh@ics.hawaii.edu">Tuan Huynh</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:jarrett@sprynet.com">Jarrett Lee</a></li>
<li><a href="mailto:jsaito@hawaii.edu">Jennifer Saito</a></li>
</ol>

These are the activities we used to develop requirements:
<ol>
<li>Overview of CSDL as an organization</li>
<li>Review of the current CSDL site</li>
<li>Analysis of sites created by similar groups</li>
<li>Interviews with current CSDL group members</li>
</ol>

We were given two weeks to organize our development group 
(which lost three members halfway through this period), do 
background research, and produce this document.   At
the current staffing level for this project, that 
represents 64 working hours.


<a name="orgContext"><h3>Organizational Context</h3></a>
CSDL was formed in 1991. It is a research group within the Department of 
Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii. CSDL pursues 
research along two general fronts: the development of computer systems 
to support group activities (collaborative software), as well as 
research on the process of developing software in a group setting 
(collaborative development). The mission of CSDL is to provide an 
environment leading to the intellectual and professional growth of all
of its members.</p>

CSDL is a member of the International Software Engineering
Research Network 
<A HREF="http://wwwagse.informatik.uni-kl.de/ISERN/isern.html"> (ISERN) </a>.
This is a group that emphasizes the need for knowledge gained through 
experimentation to promote quality improvement in software engineering. 
Organizations that are members of ISERN use a common research framework and
participate in joint research activities.

<p>The current members are:
<ul><li>Robert Brewer, student</li>
    <li>Jay Corbett, professor</li>
    <li>Anne Disney, student</li>
    <li>Jennifer Geis, student</li>
    <li>Philip Johnson, professor</li>
    <li>Carleton Moore, student</li>
    <li>Russell Tokuyama, systems programmer for UH ICS department</li>
    </ul>

Past members include:
<ul><li>Rosemary Andrada</li>
    <li>David Brauer</li>
    <li>Kiran Kavoori Ram</li>
    <li>Johnny Li</li>
    <li>Julio Polo</li>
    <li>Danu Tjahjono</li>
    <li>Dadong Wan</li></ul>

<p>
Student members of CSDL eventually graduate and hopefully find
interesting and fulfilling work.  New students then take their
places.  Therefore CSDL is not only interested in a web site that can 
make research results available to the greater computer 
science community and facilitate information sharing within
CSDL; but one that can recruit high-quality students and provide a
showcase for their work that can be viewed by potential employers.


<a name="overviewCSDLSite"><h3> Overview of the Current CSDL Site </h3></a>
<P>The major strengths of the CSDL web site are its speed and its abundance of information.  
The loading of the main page is very quick, and information on the major projects of CSDL is 
quickly accessible through links near the top of the page. This is due to the ratio between 
text and graphics being highly towards text. The only pictures on the main page are the 
(broken link) logo and the group picture. Other pages do not have many pictures; most offer 
links to screen captures to provide pictures on-request.</P>

<P>Exploring each of the <I>Projects</I> links presented on the main page presents many more 
links to technical documents, publications, and specifications. Navigating through these links 
provides a great amount of information regarding not only the programs, but also the general 
ideas behind the CSDL.</P>

<P>Despite these strengths, it is apparent that the site has its weaknesses.  The first noticeable 
weakness of the site is that it is has not been revised for some time.  The bottom of the page 
states that the page was last updated on August 28<SUP>th</SUP>, 1997. The top graphic link is 
missing, and the bottom group picture contains many members who are not part of CSDL anymore. 
There are several links throughout the entire site which are outdated and lead to inaccessible 
or missing pages.  Looking at the site directory through the back door reveals that there are 
many documents that are not being linked to through the main page, or any of the child pages. The 
site needs a scouring to find the missing links and include links for the documents that do exist.</P>

<P>The overall appearance of the site does not impress the audience. Currently, the pages do not take 
advantage of the what the web can offer, and so this could be an improvement. Colors are abandoned, 
pictures are few, and design is almost non-existent. This leaves the site to feel unfinished, as if 
plain text was just converted into HTML. While having fewer pictures improves the load time of the 
site, smart use of graphics can lead to giving the site a more professional image.  Color can be used 
as well to improve the look of the site, whether just to make the image more striking, or to provide 
schemes to relate certain pages to each other.  Finally, some design aspects should be used to improve 
the readability of the pages. Most pages consist of plain text across the screen, or lists of documents. 
The use of headers, as a minimum, can improve the portrayal of information, and further changes, such as 
fonts, sizes, and columns, may help out the site as well. </P>

<P>Furthermore, the site may be considered &quot;boring&quot; to some of the audience. Since a main 
factor of this web site will be to attract new members of CSDL, the low tone of the site may be 
detrimental in accomplishing this task. One way to improve this is to better the overall appearance 
of the site, as mentioned before, and perhaps dedicate a section to recruiting new members. Currently, 
there is nothing on the pages that seem to indicate a desire to sign up new students. A separate section 
will allow for information made especially for this task. If written or designed in a lighter tone, this 
may interest new students, but by being apart from the other pages, this will not cause the projects of 
CSDL to be portrayed non-professional. </P>

<P>The Projects section of the main page is a good example of categorizing areas of the site. Programs 
are each given separate pages where more specific information may be retrieved. Nevertheless, there does 
not seem to be any unity between the pages. Each seem to be written and organized differently from the 
other, giving a slight ironic twist to the goal of collaborative software development. As collaboration 
is a main focus to CSDL, it is important that the pages seem unified.  This may be done by many ways-using 
a template to keep the organization of links on the page similar to each other, using a common color scheme, 
or, currently used, including links to the related programs.  </P>

<P>The last link in the Projects section includes a primer of CSDL, which consists of a lot of informative 
documents on CSDL, and how the group operates. However, this inclusion into the Projects section seems out 
of place, and may cause problems if being sought for by a viewer. It would seem more organized if this link 
was included in the CSDL summary on the main page. Because this summary speaks a little about the group 
itself, the related primer would help make this information easier to find.</P>

<P>One good point about the site is that it expedites finding the various technical documents by 
including several links to the documents. At the bottom of the page are sections dividing the 
documents in different ways, such as author and subject. These links are not complete, however, 
and more work can be done to link all of the documents with the page. Another way to improve 
this section is to possibly split up the page into more sections. Currently, the Master List 
is very long, making it hard to search through, and very tedious to load. One point to keep 
in mind is that although linking the document more than once improves the navigation through 
the site, it requires more upkeep than if sites were linked only once.</P>

<P>Another way to find information could be accomplished by including a search engine.  This would 
not require much upkeep after the first installation, and would give the flexibility for the audience 
to find documents in the fashion or subject they choose. </P>

<P>The group picture on the main page is one of the few areas in the site that concentrates on the 
members of CSDL themselves. The way the site is organized, members are second in order of importance 
to the projects, as information about the authors is only sub-linked to the programs.  It is true that 
the projects make up an important section of the group, but many people like to relate to other people 
rather than programs, and so some personality to the site would be helpful.  Another reason to include 
more information on the authors is that they are hoping to find jobs through this research group, and 
importance to this rank fairly high among the members. An entire section dedicated to the individual 
members of CSDL would be an important addition to the site.</P>

<P>This section may be of great importance to some of the members, but others may feel that the projects 
have greater importance to the site. Thus, the organization of the site must be taken into consideration 
as well. The current page provides only a list of links, and this gives links at the top the feeling of 
greater importance. This could be continued in the updated site, or a more neutral organization of these 
sections may be worked out.</P>

<P>Therefore, while the site contains all of the documents needed to make it quite informative, some changes in 
design and organization will help bring this across to the CSDL web site audience.  Updating the site will link 
the sites which are not accessible through the main page and its sub-pages, show more recent information on the 
group itself, and cause the site to feel complete. Finally, additional information on the members can help them 
in the future, and further sections on recruiting new members will help expand CSDL as well.</P>

<A HREF="CRSsurvey.html">
"<i>Overview of Related Sites</i>"</A>)


<a name="genDescript"><H2>General Description</H2></a>


<a name="sytemFunct"><h3>System Functionality</h3></a>
In broad terms, the CSDL web site must make technical information
available to both group members and the outside world, as well as
share information about the group's non-technical activities and
individual members. 


<a name="userChars"><h3>User Characteristics</h3></a>
Since the intended audience for the CSDL web site consists of computer
science students, computer science professionals, and employers in the
computer science field, we feel it is safe to assume that they will
understand how to navigate web pages, fill out simple forms, and perform
other common tasks associated with the WWW. However, there are other
large differences between different audience groups:

<ul>
   <li><b>People interested in research.</b> 
      May visit the web site because they want
      to retrieve some specific technical information.  They need to
      be able to search in multiple ways for technical reports and
      to retrieve them quickly.  They may also be interested in CSDL
      software projects, which need to be presented in an 
      interesting and concise way.  An information-dense site will
      be important to this group.
      </li>
   <li><b>Software users. </b> Will visit the web to find out latest
      news about the product they are using, download releases, or
      view on-line documentation . Again, an information-dense site 
      with quick access to the information of interest will be important. </b>
      </li>
   <li><b>Non-CSDL ICS students here at UH.</b> Will probably
      not be attracted by technical information contained in the site, but
      will be more interested in learning about the people in CSDL, the
      work environment, current group activities, and information about joining. 
      A more casual style with lots of
      graphics could be appealing to this group.
      </li>
   <li><b>ICS/CS students at other institutions.</b> Will be 
      interested in the same kinds of things, but also will be
      attracted by information about studying in Hawaii, the
      quality of the ICS program here.
      </li>
   <li><b>Prospective employers.</b>Will probably visit the
      site to learn more about a specific person.   Will be 
      interested in the person's technical background and 
      research, but also in the the kind of person he/she is
      to work with.  A friendly, professional, attractive, 
      individual-based presentation would good to interest this group.
      </li>
   <li><b>CSDL members.</b>
      Will visit the web site to review CSDL procedures for
      various activities, look at other members' current work, review
      past research, etc.  Information that is well-organized and
      quickly accessible is of key importance. 
      </li>
</ul>


<p>
<a name="operSenar"><H2>Operational Scenarios</H2></a>
This section describes scenarios that illustrate, from the
user's perspective, what will be experienced when utilizing the system
under various situations.

<ul>
<li>In March, a straight-A senior computer science major at the 
    University of Minnesota receives a suggestion from one of
    her professors that she go on to get a Master's degree.
    The idea is attractive to her, but she's not really sure what's
    involved.  That evening as she huddles under a warm blanket in
    front of her PC, she types "master's thesis computer science" into 
    her search engine.  One of the links is to the CSDL site.  She 
    tries a link named "If you are a student ..." and soon is reading
    a page titled "Why Write a Thesis".  After 15 minutes she understands
    more about writing a thesis than she had thought possible.  She looks
    at pictures of friendly CSDL students and views demos of the
    software they are developing.  Pictures of the sunny, warm UH campus
    are very appealing.  She
    notices an e-mail link and writes a note to Philip.  Five months
    later her friends throw her a big party - she's leaving the next
    morning to study in Hawaii!
   </li>
<li>Dr. Aiona sits in his office in California one afternoon, doing some
    reading about formal technical review.  He suddenly remembers a fascinating
    presentation on the subject at the last ICSE meeting by a Dr. Johnson.  
    Unfortunately, he can't locate the proceedings.  However, he does locate the
    CSDL web site.  He quickly takes in the attractive main page, and finds a 
    link to publications.  A screen appears to help him search.  He easily 
    remembers the name, Johnson, and the year, 1998.  He picks "formal technical
    review" from the keyword list, and within 3 seconds a page with 2 articles
    appear.  They both look interesting, so he downloads them and prints them.
    The whole process has taken only about three minutes.  Dr. Johnson goes up
    a notch or too in his estimation - not only has he done interesting research,
    but he obviously is an organized, technically "with it" person.
   </li>
<li>Jim Sullivan of International Medical Systems is considering hiring Jennifer
    as a programmer.  On her resume, she has included a link to the CSDL site.
    He clicks on a link named "People" and finds a link for "Jennifer Geis".  He is
    immediately impressed with her list of research projects and publications.
    Noticing the warning about a large graphic, he clicks on one of the research
    projects, and is shown a screen shot of one of her software projects.  It is
    well-laid out and after reading the brief summary underneath he immediately
    understands its function.  After noticing that two of her publications deal
    with software quality, he is ready to have her on his team.
   </li>
<li>
   Ginny is a new CSDL member and she wants to make a good impression and
   be up-to-date on CSDL projects and procedures for tomorrow's weekly 
   lunch. With some trepidation she realizes that she only has one 
   immediate source of information... the CSDL web site. When she enters
   the page, Ginny gingerly clicks on the link "For CSDL Members", not
   hoping for much.  To her amazement, she finds helpful information!
   There are links to all of the current CSDL projects.  For each one she
   can read a brief synopsis, view demos or screen shots, and access more
   information. Another link helps her to get a little more comfortable
   with Emacs, and another familiarizes her with the function of LaTex.
   The next day at lunch, the terms "DRL", "LEAP", and "tech report" 
   actually make sense.
   </li>
<li>
   Patrick Modine, a programmer for GammaWare Computers, and long-time user of
   Egret, suddenly finds himself being assigned to a lead a group reviewing
   the company's latest software package.  Although positive that he wants to
   use Egret as the major tool for this project, he can't find
   manuals to distribute to his co-workers, and so visits the CSDL web site.
   There on the main page, he quickly finds a link to Egret, and following it,
   finds himself on the Egret main page. Using the search engine, he finds the
   introductory documents on the program, and saves these for future use.
   However, he notices that Egret has been updated since the last time he
   visited the page, and so downloads the latest copy.  The next day
   everyone has adequate documentation and the meeting goes smoothly.
   </li>
<li>
   Tony Wong is a well-to-do senior in the ICS Department at UH Manoa.
   He is completing his last semester and is still uncertain about what he will
   do after graduation.  One evening as he is about to check the "Job Position Openings"
   at the main ICS site, he sees a link to CSDL.  When he follows it he is
   impressed right away by appearance and design
   of the site. The familiar faces of Dr. Johnson and Rosemary - Tony's ICS professor
   and TA - further catch his attention. After reading more about CSDL's
   projects, and activities, Tony becomes interested in joining the 
   group. He can visualize his days working in Post 307, sharing challenges
   with group members; and can see how CSDL could unleash his potential. Tony can
   even see his Master's diploma in his hand!
   The next morning, Tony visits Dr.  Johnson's office.
   </li>
</ul>


<a name="functReq"><H2>Functional Requirements</H2></a>
<ol>
<li><b>Make all existing CSDL web pages and technical reports accessible
   from a single home page.</b>  At present there are many .html pages in
   the CSDL directory that are orphans or grandorphans.  These need to be
   discovered, organized, and linked in.  We have counted over 10,000
   .html files in /group/csdl, so we need to reserve a sufficient amount of
   time to determine the content and organizational structure of these pages.
   There is a tool named Linkbot at
   <A HREF="http://www.tetranetsoftware.com/linkbot-info.htm">
   http://www.tetranetsoftware.com/linkbot-info.htm</a>
   that can be downloaded and used for a free 30-day evaluation.  It can
   find broken links and orphans.  We suspect that
   a large number of the .html pages may be JavaDoc pages for old versions
   of CSDL software.  These pages do not need to be linked in - CSDL members
   have indicated that they only wish to see the JavaDoc pages for the current
   version of each project.
   </li>
<li><b>Search engines:</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Provide a flexible search mechanism for locating technical reports 
   and web pages by author, topic, keyword, word in title, and year.</b>
   We found a web page from <A HREF="http://www.mevis.de/english/CeVis">
   CeVis</a> that provides a superb example of this.
   </li>
<li><b>Provide a flexible search mechanism for locating web pages by
   keyword and word in page.</b>  This needs to be similar to the above
   function.
   </li>
</ul>
Our main interest is building our search engine on the 
<a href="http://jserv.java.sun.com/products/webserver/index.html">
Java server</a>. System Requirements:
<ol>
   <li>Includes JRE 1.1.4 
   <li>Windows 95 or higher 
   <li>Windows NT 4.0 or higher 
   <li>Solaris 2.5 or higher 
   <li>32 MB RAM 
   <li>18 MB Hard disk (minimum) 
</ol>
Using Java server, we have several possible implementations that we can 
consider.

<ol>
  <li>Write some Java programs to search through our directory structure. 
      Since we have the exact knowledge of what files/information are being 
      stored in each sub-directory, the searching function/methods will 
      hopefully not be very hard to implement.</li>
  <li>One of the Java servlet's main key features is the CGI portability
      module for existed CGI-bin scripts. </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>We can count on this feature to take advantage of some UNIX's cool 
      utilities for file searching such as (find, grep, egrep...) to build 
      our search engine.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>We can install/utilize existed CGI search engine on our system and 
    modify it to our needs. One of the free-trial search engines I found 
    is the <i>Selena's Database Manager and Search Scripts </i>.
    This search engine is written entirely in Perl script, making it easy 
    for us to implement some minor modification to feed our needs. 
    (The authors of this program viewed the codes as means to share their 
    ideas about the search engine, and encourage us to modify to codes
    to fit our system). After looking at a few examples of this search 
    engine in action (examples are located at the above URL), I believe we 
    can modify and use the program our purposes of searching people,
    projects, and activities.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li><b>Provide applet-based interfaces to some CSDL systems such as JWiz,
   JavaLOC, JavaDiff, Mako, and Honu to provide "community services".</b>
   This appears to require the development of a CSDL http server and the
   use of java servelets.
   </li>
<li><b>Design pages in such a way that they are search engine friendly.</b>
   <br>
   This will involve using the META HTML commands for each page that we would
   like a search engine to be able to find.  We also need to submit the main
   pages to search engines. There is a site 
   <A HREF="http://www.htmlgoodies.com/register.html">
   http://www.htmlgoodies.com/register.html</a>
   that explains how this is to be done.  Sufficient time needs to be
   reserved to do this for all appropriate new and existing pages.
   
   </li>
<li><b>Present CSDL projects in such a way that the ISERN relationship
   is explicit and in a format similar to projects presented
   on-line by other ISERN organizations.</b>  
   An example to follow could be the
   <A HREF="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/SoftEng/tame/topics/rtfault1.html">
   Reading Techniques for Fault Detection </A> from the University of Maryland
   TAME group. Research will be needed to determine what guidelines will be set 
   to promote an ISERN design format and relationship.
<li><b>Organize information in such a way that a user is not overloaded
   by too many choices or too much information on a page, yet is not
   required to follow one given path or ten links to find a certain page. </b>
   <br>
   This can be achieved through the use of frames, a table of contents,
   or a navigation bar. Cross indexing pages under all applicable headings
   will assure that information is easily found no matter from which
   direction the search was begun.
   </li>
<li><b>Present CSDL as an organization that has produced and is producing high-quality 
   research and software and is composed of interesting, friendly people. </b>
   This will probably involve "home pages" of a consistent design and 
   appropriate style for each individual.  These pages should be accessible
   from various paths.  There should also be pages devoted to individual projects,
   with a consistent format and various access points. 
   </li> 
<li><b>Present all information on attractive pages that are visually 
   unified and easily navigable, without the use of large or distracting 
   graphics. </b><br>
   Every graphic should have a purpose that is clearly explained and/or
   easily understood. No one feature should overpower any other and every
   thing must lend itself heightening the readability of the information.
   Examples of this are:
   <ul><li>a uniform background that is easy on the eye</li>
    <li>a legend explaining informational icons, such as is found at
        the <a href="http://wwwagse.informatik.uni-kl.de/frame.html">
        Software Engineering Research Group at the University of
        Kaiserslautern</a></li>
    <li>if using flashing text, making sure that the rate of flashing
        allows for reading the text</li>
    <li>a standard navigational theme</li></ul>

   </li>
<li><b>Provide up-to-date information about all group members.</b>
   <br>
   As the mission of CSDL is to provide an environment leading to the
   intellectual and professional growth of all of its members, providing
   information about group members will help in the professional aspect.
   Information about projects, education, and the like, will give a potential
   employer a basic overview of the member, and perhaps initiate the employer
   to contact the member. This can be done as easily as collecting information
   about the member, and posting it upon the web. A template for displaying
   this information should be designed before hand, but after the initial
   work, the overhead is minimal. There may be cases in which members do not
   wish the displaying of certain subjects of information in the site, but
   since this information should be collected from the particular individual,
   they will be able to specify this beforehand. This requirement is similar
   to requirement #7 in that the portrayal of the members should be done in
   that particular way.
   </li>
<li><b>Produce instructions for maintenance of this site after the
   691 Web Design Group has moved on.</b><br>
   We will provide a manual and sample materials for this purpose. The
manual will include step-by-step procedures on how to add a project to
the site as well as .html template and sample pages. In addition to
this, we will discuss the direction that we think the CSDL site
could be expanded to and explain the "whys" behind our design
guidelines.
   </li>
<li><b>Promote CSDL's activities within ISERN by providing ISERN-related
       links.</b>
<li><b>Incorporate active information about the process of developing the website</b>
   </li> This information should document how the CSDL site was developed by this
   team.
<li><b>Show with logos CSDL's affiliation with other organizations
   such as DEC, ISERN, Tektronics, NSF, Worldpoint, PICHTR, and 
   Makai Ocean Engineering.</b>
   <br>
      Currently, there is not much mention on the CSDL site regarding their
   affiliation with organizations such as those mentioned. CSDL would like to
   show this affiliation, and can do by including logos of the organizations
   upon their webpage. These logos may either be obtained by downloading
   graphic files from the web, or by scanning in logos from promotional
   documentation. These files in turn should be all be resized to the same
   height and width, as to not bring more attention upon one company compared
   to another.  As these logos are copyrighted, CSDL will first need to
   contact the company for consent in using and/or modifying the logos for use
   on the CSDL page. This should not be an issue after the first approval.
   Another caution would be if an organization changed their logo--this would
   need to be updated upon the CSDL web page as well. Unless notification of
   this change is obtained from the company, the only other way CSDL could
   keep updated is to manually check the affiliated organizations for changes.
   This requirement does not interact with other requirements.
   </li>
<li><b>Provide a link to the "How to Become a Hacker" page. </b>  The link is 
   <A HREF="http://www.earthspace.net/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">
   http://www.earthspace.net/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html </A>.  There should be
   a companion-type page something like "How to Become a Research Hacker".
   We will have to ask Philip to provide this.

<h3> Dicussion on the installation of CSDL's Web Server</h3>
<p>Installation of the Java Web Server seemed to gain major support from the CSDL members.
Based on the Java language, Java Web Server utilizes Java Servlets - server-side programs
- that enable you to easily extend the web server. Servlets take the place of cumbersome
CGI scripts and give developers an interface that can be used on any platform without
additional porting. <br>
The Java Web Server will be beneficial to all CSDL members in researching and developing
the network aspect of Java. The server will be plummered in the CSDL's Java oriented
environment. </p>

<p>The most probable server candidate is Sun's <a href="http://java.sun.com/">
JAVA<sup><small>TM</small></sup>WEB SERVER 1.1</a>. Java<sup><small>TM</small></sup>
Web Server 1.1 is an easy-to-use, extensible, easy-to-administer, secure, and
platform-independent solution to speed and simplify the deployment and management of 
Internet and intranet web sites. </p>

<p>The Sun's Java Web Server 1.1 consists of several features that are beneficial to the
CSDL's current and future web-based applications

<ul>
  <li>Dynamic Page Compilation, which allows server code to be embedded in an
    HTML file. This gives web developers the option of allowing customization of web content
    from the client side. </li>
  <li>Session Tracking, a mechanism for building a sophisticated, stateful
    model on top of the web's stateless protocol. With session tracking, session state is
    maintained by the server</li>
</ul>

<p>The server is simple to install and easy to administer and maintain. This solves one of
the CSDL's key concerns: limiting the amount of time devoted to network/server maintenance.

<ul>
  <li>Java Web Server installs quickly right out-of-the-box or from a download.
    GUI-based tools provide a single point of control and make it painless to tune and manage
    a web site. </li>
  <li>Once configured, Java Web Server is easy to administer. And there is no
    need to bring down the system to reconfigure the server. With Java Web Server's on-the-fly
    configuration, administrators can change user groups or make security modifications
    without having to restart the server</li>
  <li>Ensuring optimal system performance is equally impressive, with real-time
    monitoring of resource usage, and a variety of useful reports and charts. </li>
</ul>

<p>Java Web Server's security is enhanced by Secure Socket Layers (SSL),
compliant encryption and authentication technology with the advantages of the Java
Security model. Access Control lists (ACLs) can be implemented in CSDL's web site for the
control of which authenticated user gets access to specific website resources. </p>

<p>Java Web Server also consists of other features described at <a
href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-server/webserver/index.html">
http://java.sun.com/products/java-server/webserver/index.html </a>
that can ensure the ease and comfort of Java developers.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The Java Web Server 1.1's system requirements are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>JRE 1.1.4 </li>
    <li>Windows 95 or higher </li>
    <li>Windows NT 4.0 or higher </li>
    <li>Solaris 2.5 or higher </li>
    <li>32 MB RAM </li>
    <li>18 MB Hard disk (minimum) </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The server would be best installed on CSLD's natasha.ics.hawaii.edu workstation. This
system is a SPARC 20 system, with 64 MB of RAM. Although, the minimum requirement for Java
Web Server 1.1 is 32 MB, 64 MB of RAM seems to be necessary for the possible on-line demos
of CSDL's developed software. Future CSDL development might require additional memory. </p>

<a name="designGuide"><H2>Design Guidelines</H2></a>
The following design guidelines were adapted from a presentation at the
AECT 1997 Conference, by Elizabeth Boling, Kurt Squire, and Sonny Kirkley.
The full document can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.indiana.edu/iirg/ARTICLES/AECT97/guidelines.html">
http://www.indiana.edu/iirg/ARTICLES/AECT97/guidelines.html" </a>.
We used the guidelines for sites with more emphasis on content than 
affect:

<ol>
<li>Use graphics to create a visual identity and sustain it throughout the site.
   <ul>
   <li>Use small graphics and buttons to build site identity and a smaller
       "signature graphic" for lower level pages that can double as a button 
       to return to the main page.</li>
   <li>Make sure that the images used for identity convey an appropriate
       message about you and your site.  Be careful to avoid media models
       that do not match the identity you want for your site.</li>
   <li>Use few enough colors in you identity graphics that your site has
       an identifiable color scheme, and sustain the color scheme
       throughout the site</li>
   </ul>
   </li>
<li>Supply text alternatives for all graphic elements in the site, and use 
    very few text treatments (bold, italic, heading sizes).  Too many
    typographic treatments add visual noise to pages that also display
    small graphics.
   </li>
<li>Establish different treatments for the "content heavy" and "affect heavy"
    portions of the pages and/or the site.
   </li>
</ol>

Guidelines that we have collected from other sources include:
<ol>
<li>For all documents: display author (with e-mail address)  and date of
    last modification.  By displaying the date a reader can evaulate the
    timeliness and accuracy of the page's information.  Dates should be
    displayed in a format like "March 6, 1999" so that European readers
    will not be confused about the month and day.  
   </li>
<li>When appropriate display the status of information (complete/incomplete, 
   new, etc.)
   </li>
<li>Use consistent navigational icons.
   </li>
<li>Use informative, context-free titles such as "CSDL - Introduction" or
    "CSDL - Egret".
   </li>
</ol>


Guidelines from "Improving Web Site Usability and Appeal" at
<A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/plan/IMPROVESITEUSA.html">
http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/author/plan/IMPROVESITEUSA.html
</A>
<ol>
<li>Make relevant, high-quality content your number one priority.  Everything
    else is secondary, including look and feel, ease of use, etc.
   </li>
<li>Tell potential audience members how your site is relevant to them.
   </li>
<li>When using links, link people directly to relevant content rather than
    the front page of an information resource (for example, link to the
    Cinemania article on Star Wars rather than to the Cinemania home page).
   </li>
<li>Use a consistent icon to notify people when a link will take them off-site.
   </li>
<li>Tailor search interfaces to the content domain.  Prioritize and format
    results for easy scanning.
   </li>
<li>Highlight timely content on the home page.  Don't count on people
    navigating to discover that you have fresh content.  
   </li>
<li>Organize the home page by creating clearly distinguishable areas. Chunk
    information into visual groups based on topic or functional similarity
    from the audience's perspective.
   </li>
<li>Use meaningful and consistent button names to label sections and content
    areas.  Use distinguishing adjectives to label special versions of common
    Internet activities (for example Kids Chat or News Chat).
   </li>
<li>Most navigation pages should not scroll and should not be overloaded with
    navigation choices.  They should load fast.
   </li>
<li>Group navigation elements in a common space that people can easily 
    distinguish from content.
   </li>
<li>Warn people before long downloads or page-loads.
   </li>
