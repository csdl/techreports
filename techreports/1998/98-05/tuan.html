<A NAME="introduction">
<H2>I. Introduction</H2></A>

<P>Since its inception at CERN, the World Wide Web has been intended as a means for real-time collaboration. The desire to collaborate with other around the world formed the backbone of this project, and so the primary level of the WWW has been to share information with others. However, the methods in sharing information have never been standardized, and most likely never will be. It is only with a mix between research and trial-by-error that one can provide an effective web site that can functionally share its information with people all over the world.</P>

<P>It was natural for a group that concentrated on collaboration to use a service that was also based on sharing information. The Collaborative Software Development Laboratory (CSDL) initially published their page during the first generation of web site design. In the early days of the World Wide Web, most information was simply listed in one large page. These sites did not concentrate too much on the structure of the site, or the design of the pages contained within, as the major point of the WWW was to share one's information. The CSDL page had a simple listing of research projects accomplished by the group, as well as reference points to the many publications written by the group. Due to the lower modem speeds and bandwidth issues, a minimum of pictures were used, including only the organization's logo and a group photo.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, as web site design evolved over the years, the CSDL web site did not change along with it. Its layout, which was effective in the early-nineties, was greatly outdated, and the overall feel of the site was monotone and uninteresting. The content of the site was also outdated, as many new projects were not included in the site, and there was no mention of the group losing and adding members during the years. As the web page began to take a new role over the years--that of exhibiting an organization's identity, it was apparent that a change had to be made to the site. The neglect of the web site now had the ability to cause a negative impression of CSDL to be formed by visitors, and this needed to be resolved.</P>

<P>The Aziza group (formally 691 Web Development Team) was commissioned by CSDL to implement a new web site. The group was assigned not only to update the entire site, but also to research and investigate the process and life cycle of World Wide Web site development. This examination into the various methods involved would then become one of CSDL's own research projects.</P>

<P>The updating of the CSDL web site would be used as the basis of this research document. Issues such as the balance between providing information and providing an image of the group would be discussed and examined, and ways to share research information over the World Wide Web would be studied. To back the data researched, evaluations by the various users of the site would be conducted and examined. This document records our web site design processes, what insights we had about those processes, our findings, and finally, our conclusions.</P>

<A NAME="planning">
<H2>II. Planning and Information Gathering</H2></A>

<P>CSDL is a highly prolific organization, in the years that it has existed, they have literally turned out thousands of 
pages of HTML and documentation.  Despite this, though, the design group's first urge was still to sit down and immediately 
create a web page.  We quickly realized, however, that to be able to complete the web site in a relatively short amount of 
time (one semester) our group needed to organize. Before considering designing pages, we needed to get an overview of the 
project. To this end, we created a Software Requirements Specification.</P>

<H3><A HREF="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06/98-06.html">Software Requirements Specification</A></H3>
<P>The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) gave us a point to start from and outlined our goals; it directed our 
actions throught the entire design and construction of the site. The SRS was comprised of several informational parts: an 
overview of the CSDL site as an organization, an evaluation of the then-current CSDL site for its strengths and weaknesses, 
an evaluation of similar research and development sites for their strength and weaknesses, a determination of the uses and 
users of the new site, a determination of the goals that the new site should meet, and finally, guidelines for designing 
the new site. This process, although several weeks long, was well worth the effort.</P>

<P>By collecting information on <A HREF="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06/98-06.html#orgContext"> the CSDL 
organization</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06.html#overviewCSDLSite">evaluating the 
then-current site</A>, we familiarized ourselves with the structure of CSDL and with the nature of the information that 
would need to be organized. The organization of the current site gave us an idea, at least in part, of how the updated site 
might be presented.</P>

<P>Doing evaluations on both CSDL's site and <A HREF="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06/CRSsurvey.html">
other similar sites</A> focused attention on what good ideas other web sites were employing and also provided first-hand 
experience with some ideas and formats not to use. Information that was just as valuable to know as the former.</P>

<P>To determine the uses and users of the new site, the group interviewed each member of CSDL. These 
<A HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:8080/Research/Aziza/SupportDocs/prelimSRS/691prelim.html"> interviews</A> clarified 
for us what the customer (the CSDL members) expected out of the site - who they thought would use it, the information that 
they wanted available through the site, and a basic idea of how that information was to be presented.</P>

<P>With all of those things in mind, we developed the web site's 
<A HREF="http://www.ics.hawaii.edu/~csdl/techreports/98-06/98-06.html#functReq">functional requirements and design 
guidelines</A>. The purpose of these were to give the group a direction to go in with the development of the new site. 
Spending time early on to get a good idea of what the new web site needed to do, eliminated doubling back and extra work 
due to forgetting any needed functionality.</P>


<A NAME="design">
<H2>III. Design of the Site's Layout</H2></A>
<P>After completing the SRS, we had a fairly good idea of what information the site was to contain, but it was still 
amorphous. The lines along which CSDL's information would be divided and presented were not yet articulated. To formalize
those decisions we created schemas.</P>

<H3><A HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:8080/Research/Aziza/SupportDocs/info/schemas.html">Schemas</A></H3>
<P>For this project's purposes, schemas were detailed listings of the required information for each element of the site. 
Determining these lists moved the project along on several levels. First, it necessitated the decision of what sections the 
site would have, i.e. a section on Members, a section for research projects, a section for software tools, etc. This called 
for a careful consideration of the categories. We wanted the CSDL site to have a firm semblance of structure without being 
too rigid. It would have been extremely bad design if adding something to the site called for its restructuring. At the 
same time, it was not desirable to create a miscellaneous section just have a place to put everything that would not 
conveniently fit into the available categories. Second, the decision of what information each section was to contain 
provided a template for each section, meaning that each instance of a section would have a formalized structure and an 
organized, uniform feel.</P>

<P>Overall, the schemas provided an overview of the logical structure of the site.  It allowed a visualization of the 
interlinkings of the different sections and gave a short listing of all information being provided. Once the schemas were 
completed, individual Aziza members were assigned to put together different informational pages. For instance, Jennifer was 
assigned to complete the member page of Carleton Moore and the research pages for his projects. Although the layout of the 
site was not yet complete, the schemas told us what information was needed and how it would be organized on the page.</P>


<A NAME="development">
<H2>IV. Development of the Site's Layout</H2></A>
<P>The development stage of the project concentrated on formalizing two things - navigation and message. While a bad 
navigational system is never desired, an appropriate one can add an extra dimension to the represented organization. 
Consider how appropriate it would be for an art dealer to organize their site as an art museum; each wing dedicated to a 
different style, each room dedicated to an individual artist. From this illustration you can see how closely layout and 
theme are tied and also how a fitting or complimentary theme can strengthen the overall impact of a site.</P>

<P>The group felt that for such an important and key element of the site (and also because it is in this area where there 
will be the greatest differences in opinion), the best way to decide on a system was to prototype the different ideas. Also, 
prototypes gave the CSDL members something concrete to look at and think about. In this manner we were able to show them 
the look of various options, such as frames vs. no frames and different types of navigational schemes.</P>


<H3>Pre-coding Prototypes</H3>
<P>The first ideas were limited to paper. We brainstormed extreme ideas of web page design without any regard to the work 
involved. The prototypes were designed both by the group as a whole and individually. The main idea was to get down as many 
ideas as possible, from classical and mainstream to avant-garde and wacky. It was almost certain that we would not use any 
of the first few prototypes, but the real purpose was for everyone to present all of their best ideas, running the gamut 
from one extreme to the other. As we examined the different navigational paradigms, we liked the ideas, but agreed that the 
more outlandish ones would prove too difficult to upkeep, and so initially a traditional "side-link" design was chosen.</P>

<P>The first request by <A HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:8080/Members/PhilipJohnson.html">Dr. Philip Johnson</A>, our 
"manager", was for us to incorportate a large photo as the background of the main page. This photo would have clear 
separations of sky, mountain, sand, and water; each element/section of the picture would correspond to a different section 
of the web site. This particular idea did not survive, as the group decided that there was a need of more than four 
sections in the site, and creating a viable image map would be nearly impossible, due to the different video resolutions 
available.</P><BR>

<H3>Alpha Prototypes</H3>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="alpha1.jpg" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="232" ALT="Prototype 1">
</TD>
<TD>
<P>Instead, The Aziza group decided to use half of the suggestion: using a large photo as the background. Our first 
prototype consisted of multi-colored buttons, based on standard colors defined by the W3 organization. The initial idea was 
to have a side bar of buttons, where the background of the side bar corresponded to the button selected. This would enable 
the user to know which section they were in, giving both functionality and color to the site. However, this scheme proved 
to be too gaudy, and the group rejected it almost immediately after prototype completion.</P>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>
<P>The next prototype used the same idea of multi-colored buttons, but in a frame format. Also, we moved away from the idea 
of having the entire background as a large picture, and instead split up the screen. More things were added to this 
prototype, such as a logo and more wording, but all still felt that there was great room for improvement.</P>
</TD>
<TD>
<IMG SRC="alpha2.jpg" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="232" ALT="Prototype 1">
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>The feeling at this point was that thinking together as a group was leading nowhere, and so we decided to split up and 
come back with four different ideas from which we might choose from. One idea included using pictures as the back of the 
buttons, and having a neutral background for the rest of the site. Another idea used an applet that would provide pop-up 
menus corresponding to the button that the mouse pointer was over. This applet was well received by both the group and 
Dr. Johnson, so we decided to expand on this idea. </P>

<H3>Beta / Delta Prototypes</H3>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>
<P>The group experimented on different ways of using the navigation buttons as a location indicator, but none did as well 
as the original applet method. Another avenue of design came forth at this point - the idea of 
using an antique aloha shirt design as the back of the buttons. The design wrapped across the buttons, and an 
antique-looking script was used as the font. Despite the fact that this design issue had nothing to do with navigation, 
all agreed that it looked better than the original button set, and we decided to expand on this. The group used this new 
site layout along with the java applet, and all felt that the development was coming along nicely. </P>

</TABLE>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="delta1.jpg" ALT="Delta Prototype 1">
</TD>
<TD>
<P>A new point, however, was brought up during the presentation of this layout - that of screen real estate. When looking 
at the main page from a browser running 640x480, the buttons filled over 1/3 of the screen, which was unacceptable. To 
solve this problem, it decided to greatly shrink the buttons and put them on the top of the screen rather than down the 
side. The aloha-shirt design was used again, but use of a different font was needed in order to fit on the smaller 
buttons.</P>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>
<P>The group felt that they were close to finalizing the site design, but Dr. Johnson introduced a new design issue--that of having a site map on the screen for navigation. The group implemented this, using the Delta1/Top button prototype, and adding a list of links along the side of the screen. The prototype was presented to Dr. Johnson and the group waited on his approval. </P>

<H3>Gamma Prototypes</H3>

<TABLE WIDTH=* BORDER=0>
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC="gamma1.jpg" WIDTH="288" HEIGHT="223" ALT=""></TD>
<TD>
<P>An email was sent out by Dr. Johnson to the group, discussing his new vision for the site. Instead of choosing between top navigational buttons and a side site map, the two were to be blended together into one. The CSDL banner was to be removed, and replaced by a logo.  The site map was to appear on the main page, giving it a functionality other than that of a welcoming screen, while the navigational buttons would remain at the top of all other child pages in the site. Furthermore, the Comic Sans font was to be used throughout the site, matching the many posters which were made by CSDL. We agreed on these ideas, and 
implemented it in time for a presentation to the CSDL group.</P>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

<P>During this meeting, some design aspects were brought out by the group members. Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the site was the large picture background, the only design element that had been retained from the original alpha prototypes. It was agreed upon that the picture was too "tourist bureau"-like, and gave the wrong first impression. This picture also made it very hard to read the text, and so the task of finding a new background picture was made definate. The buttons were also scrutinized, and a request for better buttons was made. Because of the changes to the site, the aloha-shirt design did not fit in anymore, and so these were disgarded. </P>

<H3>Final Touches</H3>
<P>Our design was almost finalized, with only some minor graphical enhancements to be changed. The logo was redone, first 
using CorelDraw to edit the original .cdr file and include the name of the laboratory. This was then exported into 
Photoshop and shrunken, keeping both the clarity of the logo, and the compression of the JPEG format together. The buttons 
were also changed, discarding the original design of the aloha-shirt background. The group saw the problems of having only 
selected and unselected buttons, so a "focus" indicator was added to our buttons. This indicated if a user was in a 
section, but not necessarily at the main page of the section. Several prototypes of these buttons were made, and an oval 
design was finally chosen. The group also decided to obtain better background pictures, and these were chosen from the 
collection of Douglas Peebles, a professional photographer. His permission to use his pictures on the CSDL site was 
approved, and a script was run to rotate these pictures daily. Finally, the decision to retire the Comic Sans font from the web site was made. While being popular among some group members, and Dr. Johnson, the font took up too much on-screen real estate, and was not very readable in large blocks of text. It was agreed that the font specifications be left up to the user's browser.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="final.jpg" WIDTH="360" HEIGHT="281" ALT=""></DIV>

<P>As of this writing, the CSDL web site design consists of oval buttons at the top, with a rotating picture background. 
This site layout has evolved greatly from our original vision, yet the first idea for the site is still in place: the photo 
background. Although we were not able to use some of our more innovative ideas, we learned that design of a navigation tool 
for a web site involves not only the look of the graphics, but also the functionality and ease of upkeep for the site 
administrator. In an organization where no one is able to devote their time to upkeeping a site, as is the case with CSDL, 
the graphics should be simple and easy to edit.</P>
<A NAME="construction">
<H2>V. Construction</H2></A>

<P>Once the final layout for the site was developed, the group was able to get down to the actual building of the new site. 
Each member of the group had individual assignments of which members, projects, and areas of the site they were to work on.
This allowed everyone to work on our own. What this meant, however, was that communication was crucial. Miscommunication  
could have created inconsistencies, leading to double work fixing mistakes. The time spent working on the SRS, schemas, and 
etc. would have been for naught.</P>

<P>In an effort to avoid this, our group posted everything it could think of. In this way, all information was always 
available. The time spent was worth it - especially if a member missed a meeting. With everything available on-line, the 
member could easily and without hassle, catch up to the rest of the group. Following are the types of documents that we
utilized to keep group communication flowing:</P>

<H3><A HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:8080/Research/Aziza/SupportDocs/691meet.html">Meeting Notes</A></H3>
<P>Each week the Aziza group had anywhere from one to four meetings. One of the weekly meetings was a class meeting in 
which the group would meet with Dr. Johnson. The rest of the meetings were group meetings, where the group would get 
together and iron out project details. Because a great deal of information was discussed during each one of these meetings, 
it was invaluable to have the meeting notes posted on the web. It allowed us to go back and review decisions at any time of 
the day or night.</P>

<H3><A HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:8080/Research/Aziza/SupportDocs/691todo.html">"To Do" Lists/Deadlines</A></H3>
<P>While each meeting was described in detail, it was useful to have a location to keep a "laundry list" of things to do. 
There was a To Do list for each meeting in which assignments were handed out. The To Do lists had areas for members to 
insert a "Yes" once a given task was completed. These provided an overall view of both what had been done and what was left 
to do. It also served as a reminder for who was doing what assignment - occasionally there were times when we would become 
confused over who was responsible for what task and looked to the To Do lists for clarification.</P>

<H3>General To Do List</H3>
<P>The General To Do List was put together as the project neared its close and the things left to do could be listed. Its 
content was added to as things were found that needed to be done and updated as they were completed. Having this list and 
watching as its items were checked off gave the group a feeling of accomplishment. Each item that was completed was one 
step closer to a finished web site.</P>

<H3>Monthly Calendars</H3>
<P>As the project came to a close, deadlines came due quicker and more frequently. Monthly calendars gave us an overview of 
when things were due in relation to each other. Seeing all of the deadlines on a monthly calendar helped to reinforce how 
crucial time management would be in the last few months.</P>

<H3>Hours</H3>
<P>Each member of our group kept an accounting of how his or her hours were spent on the project. During the project, it 
was a useful gauge for how much or how little was accomplished for the week. These summaries also showed in black and white 
how efficient the group or individual was. If a lot of hours were recorded, but there was little work to show, then 
something needed to be changed.  Conversely, if relatively few hours were being recorded, but a lot was accomplished, then 
there was an ego boost for the week.</P>

<P>At the end of the semester, keeping the hours allowed the group to view how time was divided between the different types 
of work and how the work level had its varying high and low points. Keeping this accounting brought home how the type of 
work changed throughout the project's life time. About half way through the semester we needed to re-define the time 
categories that had previously been designated.</P>

<H3>Standards</H3>
<P>The following documents were put together for the purpose of coordinating the work methods of four different people. As 
mentioned earlier, one of the toughest parts of team projects is communication, especially communication of standards. 
Without standards, it is far too easy to spend time re-doing work that could have easily been done in the correct format 
the first time. It was for this reason that standards for our work were created.</P>

<H3>Standards - Site Standards</H3>
<P>These refer to general HTML writing standards that the group tried to adhere to while writing the individual pages. This 
not only included the nitty-gritty of HTML writing, such as using relative links instead of hard-coded links, but also 
examples of standard headers and footers to be used.</P>

<H3>Standards - Templates</H3>
<P>As noted before, each section of the CSDL site had a schema written up for it. Since each instance of a section 
category, such as each member's page, was to contain generally the same information, it was natural to have produced 
template pages that contained the basic structure of each type of page, pre-formatted and only waiting for content to be 
filled in. This cut down considerably the amount of writing that would otherwise have had been done and also on any content 
inconsistencies.</P>


<A NAME="sitemaint">
<H2>VI. Site Maintenance</H2></A>
<P>Trying to maintain a site (even a small one) is a never-ending task. The site adminstrator is forever fixing broken 
links or adding and changing the contents of the site. Because of this, the Aziza group dedicated a section to site 
maintenance.</P>

<H3>Man Pages</H3>
<P>In the FAQ section of the CSDL site, there is a question/link titled "How do I update the site?" Under this link is an
index of Manual Pages. This is a listing of pages that give instruction on how to maintain the site: from moving a member 
to the Ohana section to restarting the server, they provide instruction and information on how to do it all.</P>

<P>This section was created because the process of maintaining a site can often be involved and sometimes confusing. By 
providing a checklist on how to do things, whomever is the maintainer does not need to have intimate knowledge of the inner 
working and inter-linkings of the entire CSDL site. They just need to have a fair knowledge of HTML and UNIX commands and 
can quickly update the site with confidence that they are not missing or forgetting something.</P>

<H3>WebTester</H3>
<P>There is also an installed a utility, WebTester 1.05, that checks for broken links and orphaned files on a site-wide 
basis. It runs nightly and automatically posts its' error results under the FAQ page's question, "What are the results of 
the most recent link check on the CSDL site?"  It is an easy way to keep the site running error-free and smoothly.</P>


<A NAME="testing">
<H2>VII. Testing</H2></A>
<P>Usually, testing and evaluation are combined issues. In respect to the CSDL web site, however, the two have been 
seperated.  In this case, testing refers to internal evaluations such as goal achievement and a few technical
concerns.</P>

<H3>Previous Site Versus Updated Site</H3>
<P>One method of testing the new site's qualities is to compare it to the previous site. Following is a brief evaluation of 
the old site and a listing of the improvements made by the new site.</P>

<H3>Previous Site Versus Updated Site - Evaluation of Old Site</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>Strengths.</B> The major strengths of the previous CSDL web site were its speed and abundance of information. The 
    loading of the main page was very quick because the ratio between text and graphics highly favored text. Information on 
    the major projects were quickly accessible through links near the top of the page. Navigating through these links 
    provided a great amount of information regarding not only the projects, but also the general ideas behind CSDL.</LI>
<LI><B>Currency.</B> The previous site had not been revised for some time - since August 28th, 1997 - there were many 
    broken links, missing graphics, and orphaned pages. Also, the bottom group picture contained many members who were no ]
    longer an active part of CSDL. </LI>
<LI><B>Unimpressive appearance.</B> The site did not take advantage of newer technologies that the web offered. It appeared
    that colors had been abandoned and design was almost non-existent leading to an unfinished feeling; as if plain text 
    had been converted into HTML to get the pages posted.</LI>
<LI><B>Readablilty.</B> Most pages consisted of plain text across the screen, or lists of documents. The use of headers, at 
    a minimum, could improve the portrayal of information.  Further changes, such as fonts, sizes, and columns, could help 
    to improve page layout.</LI> 
<LI><B>The site as a recruiting agent.</B> The site may have been considered "boring" to some members of CSDL's audience. 
    Since one of the primary goals of the web site is to attract new members of CSDL, the low tone of the site may have 
    been detrimental to accomplishing this task. There was nothing in the site that indicated a desire to sign up new 
    students.</LI>
<LI><B>Feeling of non-collaboration.</B> The site contained an immediate branching into the projects. This created a 
    feeling of disjointedness been the pages. Each seem to have been written and organized differently from the other, 
    giving an ironic twist to the goal of "collaborative" software development.</LI>
<LI><B>Lack of organization.</B> The last link in the Projects section included a primer which was comprised of a lot of 
    informative documents on CSDL and information on how the group operates. However, this inclusion in the Projects 
    section seemed out of place and may have been hard to find when being sought for by a viewer.</LI>
<LI><B>Publication lists.</B> The previous site expedited finding the technical documents by dividing the documents up into 
    different categories, such as by author or by subject. However, these links were not complete and the Master List was 
    very long, making it hard to search through, and tedious to load.</LI>
<LI><B>Search engine.</B> There was no search engine or means to search the site.</LI>
<LI><B>Lack of member visibility.</B> The way that the site was organized, members were second in order of importance to 
    the projects - information about them were sub-linked into the project sections.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Previous Site Versus Updated Site - Improvements</H3>
<OL>
<LI><B>Top page.</B> The original site had a top page that contained two major "sections": one with links to seven projects 
    and one with links to publication indexes.  Besides being out of date, this organization was superficial and incomplete. 
    The current top page provides six major sections with over 50 links. The page is up to date with double the number 
    of research projects. It also provides "first class" status to members, affiliates, and software tools produced by the 
    site, providing a much fuller representation of the mission products, and relationships of CSDL with other groups. 
    Furthermore, the top-page is organized such that it prints out in one page: i.e. it occupies about the same amount of 
    space as the old one!</LI>
<LI><B>Navigation.</B> The old site had only a single navigation link from interior links back to the top page. The current 
    button-based navigation bar can take you to any of the six major sections.</LI>
<LI><B>Search.</B>  The old site had no search mechanism. The current one has a nice search facility with pre-built 
    keywords.</LI>
<LI><B>Page formats.</B>  The old site had no common representation for information.  The new site provides template 
    structures for each type of information (research project, software tool, member page), that help ensure the 
    completeness and consistency of the information.  In addition, the research template is consistent with the ISERN 
    format.</LI>
<LI><B>Addition of java-based tools.</B> The new site is designed to enable CSDL java-based tools to be used from a 
    browser-based interface (using the servlett mechanism).</LI>
<LI><B>Section summary pages.</B>  The old site jumped from the top level into the details.  The new site enables people to 
    obtain:
    <OL TYPE="a">
    <LI>an overview of CSDL by reading just the top-level page. (1 page)
    <LI>a more detailed overview by reading just the top-level page and the single page section summaries (7 pages)</LI>
    <LI>even more details by looking at the research, software, member, etc. pages.</LI>
    <LI>the most detailed view by following links from (c) to reading actual technical reports, design pages, etc.</LI>
    </OL></LI>
<LI><B>Project and tool distinction.</B> The new site makes a critical structural and semantic distinction between the 
    tools produced by CSDL and the research produced by CSDL that may involve these tools.  The old site mixed these 
    separate issues together.</LI>
<LI><B>Sponsors/Affiliates.</B> The old site made no mention of sponsors/affiliates.  The new site makes them first class 
    members.</LI>
<LI><B>Site evaluation.</B> The new site contains an evaluation of its design and effectiveness, thus making itself a 
    research project. The old site didn't.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>Meeting Functional Requirements</H3>
<P>Another way to internally test the success of the new site is to look at the functional requirements that were listed
in the SRS and the ways in which their achievements were approached.</P>

<P>This is a listing of the main point of each of the functional requirements and an accompanying discussion on how they 
addressed:</P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Present CSDL as an organization that has produced and is producing high-quality research and software and is composed 
    of interesting, friendly people.</B>
    <P>This was indirectly addressed by creating a Research section, a Software Tools and Tools section, and a Members 
    section. The Research section brings attention to the fact that CSDL is a <I>Research and Development</I> group. Having 
    a distinction between Research and Software Tools and Tools emphasizes that CSDL is not just a bunch of students who 
    got together to write programs. They are a collection of graduates, undergraduates, faculty, etc. who perform valuable 
    research and who produce marketable products. The members section brings personality into the site and provides a 
    formal area where the group members can represent themselves.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Provide up-to-date information about all group members.</B>
    <P>Each member has their own page in the site. Once they are no longer members of the group, they can be moved to the 
    Ohana section. In effect this takes them off the active research list, but does not cut them off from the group.</P>
    </LI>

<LI><B>Organize information in such a way that a user is not overloaded by too many choices or too much information on a 
    page, yet is not required to follow one given path or ten links to find a certain page.</B>
    <P>The site was designed with the intention of having an even layering of information. All of the navigational pages 
    (the main page and the summary pages) not only provide links, but also provide a lot of summarized information. If more 
    detail is needed, the user has to merely click on a desired subject.</P>
    <P>There is also a strict navigational system implemented throughout the site. Each of the pages in the first three 
    levels (main page, summary pages, pages linked to from the summary pages) has a top-situated navigation bar. The 
    buttons on this bar provide direct links to the main page and the summary pages. In all pages throughout the site, 
    except for the main page, there is also a bottom-situated text navigation bar. It provides the same links to the main 
    page and summary pages. Linking only to the main and summary pages provides a low-cost, controlled, yet still 
    flexible, way to navigate throughout the site. It also sends the user to a position in the site where they can 
    quickly re-orient themselves if they happen to get lost or come to the CSDL site via an inner-page.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Make all existing CSDL web pages and technical reports accessible from a single home page. At present there are many 
    HTML pages in the CSDL directory that are orphans or grand-orphans. These need to be discovered, organized, and linked 
    in.</B>
    <P>All pages in the CSDL site are accessible in some way or form through the main page. The WebTester's service 
    provides a daily listing of of broken links and orphaned pages that can be used as a reference when maintaining the 
    site.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Present all information on attractive pages that are visually unified and easily navigable, without the use of  
    large or distracting graphics. Every graphic should have a purpose that is clearly explained and/or easily understood. 
    No one feature should overpower any other and every thing must lend itself to heightening the readability of the 
    information.</B>
    <P>As of this writing, the CSDL site uses one relatively large graphic for the background of the navigational pages. 
    This does, however, have a purpose. For one, it shows off one of the advantages of joining CSDL - the possibility of 
    working in beautiful Hawaii. Secondly, the graphic is faded enough so that it is not overly distracting and provides 
    that "something" that distinguishes the CSDL site from others. Moreover, the graphic disappears from anything deeper 
    than the navigational pages, replaced by a background of a solid, complimentary color.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Provide applet-based interfaces to some CSDL systems such as JWiz, JavaLOC, JavaDiff, Mako, and Honu to provide 
    "community services".</B>
    <P>A mechanism has been provided where community services, such as JavaWizard, can be run. A java web server has been
    installed on Natasha to safely run services without the security hassles previously faced on www.ics. Within the 
    site, adding a service function to an existing project was designed to be a simple process.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Provide a flexible search mechanism for locating technical reports and web pages by author, topic, keyword, word in 
    title, and year.</B>
    <P>Searching the web site has been given its own section. However, it does more than just search for technical reports. 
    It does site-wide searches on any word or words that the user chooses and also provides several sets of keywords that 
    the user can choose from to help direct their search.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Design pages in such a way that they are search engine friendly. This will involve using the META HTML commands for 
    each page that we would like a search engine to be able to find. We also need to submit the main pages to search 
    engines.</B>
    <P>We have not met this requirement.</P></LI>

<LI>Present CSDL projects in such a way that the ISERN relationship is explicit and in a format similar to projects 
    presented on-line by other ISERN organizations.</B>
    <P>The general outline of each research page follows the ISERN standard. Also, if a project has an ISERN affiliation, 
    it is noted in the Participants section of the research or tools page.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Promote CSDL's activities within ISERN by providing ISERN-related links.</B>
    <P>Each research page contains a section where participants are listed. If the project has an ISERN affiliation, it is 
    noted there. Also, ISERN is represented in the site's Affiliates section. There is a link to the ISERN home page 
    provided in that area.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Show with logos, CSDL's affiliation with other organizations such as DEC, ISERN, Tektronics, NSF, Worldpoint, 
    PICHTR, and Makai Ocean Engineering.</B>
    <P>All industry partners and affiliates are given their own section called Affiliates. This section contains their 
    logos and a short description of the nature of their affiliation with CSDL.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Produce instructions for maintenance of this site after the 691 Web Design Group has moved on.</B>
    <P>There is a question under the FAQ section, called "How do I update the site?". It links into the manual pages index 
    - a listing of help pages that gives a breakdown of how to update and maintain the site.</P></LI>

<LI><B>Incorporate active information about the process of developing the web site.</B>
    <P>This document is one of the many that relate to the design and development of this web site. The 
    <A HREF="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu:8080/Research/Aziza/Aziza.html">Aziza research project</A> is dedicated to 
    documenting a case study of WWW Research and Development site development.</P></LI>

<A NAME="siteeval">
<H2>VIII. Site Evaluation</H2></A>
<P>Site evaluation of the updated CSDL site was handled in two different ways. One way was to hold in-depth interviews, or
interviews in which members of the Aziza development group physically sat down with an evaluator and led them through the
site. The second way was through a questionnaire sent out via e-mail asking for 10 minutes - 5 minutes to look around the
site, and 5 minutes to send back the reviewer's first impressions.</P>

<H4>First impression of site&#146;s design, graphics and layout </H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Nice, attractive, grabbing </LI>
  <LI>It looks pretty good. Must spend some time in designing it.</LI>
  <LI>Much better than the old one.</LI>
  <LI>Exciting images, yet make the text somewhat hard to read</LI>
  <LI>Well organized, clean</LI>
  <LI>Very easy to find things and jump directly to the items </LI>
  <LI>Does not have the &quot;cluttered&quot; feel that many web pages have nowadays</LI>
  <LI>About the group members' picture wearing shades:<UL>
      <LI>Loved the 'company uniform' with the shades</LI>
      <LI>The pictures of everyone wearing shades are pretty funny and sneaky. Yet a few others
        dislike this idea.</LI>
      <LI>Not very helpful to recognize people wearing sun glasses.<BR>
      </LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
  <LI>Close-up pictures have an eerie feel to them</LI>
  <LI>Nice colors settings for the page.</LI>
  <LI>Nice sitemap, very helpful.</LI>
  <LI>The site is user friendly due to the easy accessing of pages</LI>
  <LI>Pretty positive.</LI>
  <LI>Very easy to navigate, and could tell what was going on at a glance</LI>
  <LI>&quot;When not loading the images, the box lines cut off the text in the banner so you can't read it. I know it's hard to do but I hate it when I can't read it. Then I tried to load the images and only half of them came through. I don't know if that's you or me, but it's never happened before&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;I find that web page designers waste way too much effort trying to get the layout &quot;just right&quot;, when it really doesn't seem to matter much (except for perhaps about 2% of web sites)&quot;</LI>
  <LI>Nice, yet the images size needs to be smaller. It took 3 minutes to load the page on 33.6 kps modem.</LI>
  <LI>&quot;The background, by the way, is very subtle on my computer {PowerMac running Netscape} and not essential if it delays load.)&quot;</LI>
  <LI>Prefer the buttons on the side if possible.</LI>
  <LI>Buttons are nice.</LI>
  <LI>The font color of the text as well as the unvisited links of it does not show too much contrast to the BG color - blue text against blue background, a bit irritating to the eye.</LI>
  <LI>&quot;The light blue makes me a bit sleepy though :)<b>&quot;</LI>
  </B>
  <LI>Background photos seem to be tiled - not good - they took too long to load</LI>
  <LI>Like the layout of &quot;Research&quot; page. Not only do I have the project name but I immediately have a description, contact, and a date without moving to a &quot;text only&quot; document. This is a very nice feature and quickly allows me to navigate to the site that best suits my needs.</LI>
  <LI>The layout is very clean and readable</LI>
  <LI>It is hard to understand the abbreviations in the menu to the left.</LI>
  <LI>Mountain background isn't tall enough and I get this weird underworld mountain sticking up beneath it. Brings to mind ideas of Hades.</LI>
  <LI>Redundancy within the buttons in the top and the options in the left.</LI>
  <LI>Like the &quot;pushbutton&quot; images and the way that various sections have a uniform layout/style</LI>
  <LI>Prolific</LI>
  <LI>Good job. Now if only the ICS web site was half as good.</LI>
  <LI>The refresh rate when you scroll down the home page. It might be my machine but it doesn't do that at other sites. It&#146;s real jerky.</LI>
  <LI>From the home page, in the blue box that has the member summaries and the individual members when I selected your name, the transition to your site took an inordinately long time with a pink colored background inching down my screen.</LI>
  <LI>The first time I did this I ended up re-booting my computer because I thought the time it was taking was a function of my computer seizing up. The second time I did it, it did the same thing. I don't think it&#146;s a memory thing with my computer. The site was not terribly complex with lots of graphics - just a small photo of you and the rest was text.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The suggestions are focused on the site's design and layout. They are very constructive and helpful comments for future web designers to consider and reformat the site accordingly during the optimization of the site.More than 90% of the surveys indicates the site's overall layout, design and graphics are well-defined and attractive. The site is organized, clear making the site is very easy to navigate. However, the graphics on the first page is intensive and it takes approximately 3 minutes for loading on a 33.6 kps modem. This is an issue that we are all aware of, yet could not find the best solution.  The main load is derived from the background picture, yet reducing or fading colors meaning reducing the picture quality. This concern among other comments is an example of an item in our &quot;To Do List&quot; for the optimization of the site. </P>

<H4>First impression on site&#146;s content </H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Very informational</LI>
  <LI>Compact, dense</LI>
  <LI>Adequate for most purposes.</LI>
  <LI>Affiliate section is great</LI>
  <LI>&quot;The &quot;research&quot; and &quot;software&quot; sections seemed to be rather repetitive (AEN/LEAP, etc.). I realize that there were some things that weren't, but that was still the impression I was left with.&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;Member section still a little thin; for example, from the summaries page I expected, when clicking on names to see more info (&quot;I like to surf,&quot; &quot;my hobbies are,&quot; whatever)&quot;</LI>
  <LI>Seems pretty comprehensive and has some value to the interested browser, i.e. software that can be downloaded plus papers that can be downloaded.</LI>
  <LI>&quot;Is a &#145;browser-based interface&#146; any different from a browser? Does the word &#145;interface&#146; really add anything? It seems to be used throughout the page as a noise-buzzword.</LI>
  <LI>Too many acronyms</LI>
  <LI>I particularly liked:<BR>
    <UL>
      <LI>the format of the research summaries.</LI>
      <LI>the fact that the &quot;Research&quot; page listed the active period of various projects</LI>
      <LI>the FAQ for new group members</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>
</UL>

<UL>
  <LI>&quot;I was a little disappointed to find that many publications weren't available from the web site&quot;</LI>
  <LI>The names of the software are not suggestive.</LI>
  <LI>More information on personal web pages.</LI>
  <LI>Provide downloads for J-wiz and the others</LI>
  <LI>Hi-Time very interesting</LI>
  <LI>Too much content is in the first page</LI>
  <LI>&quot;I did read through some of the FAQ. I got through the first three levels of the CSDL Maturity .... model (I forgot the exact name). The first two levels made sense to me.  I started reading a description of the different languages (?) and what you should be able to do with them in order to demonstrate competency in them and I got lost.</LI>
  <LI>the understanding of the first page contents is not visually immediate. &quot;Textual comments on this page&quot; window encapsulating the textual part could probably help to have a more immediate communication.</LI>
  <LI>The summaries at the beginning of each sub-section give a further overview. I really liked this multi-layer approach</LI>
  <LI>The FAQ idea is brilliant and would make it so much easier for a new person coming into the group.<BR>
  </LI>
</UL>

<P>Regarding the aspect of site's content, our surveys shows that almost everyone agreed that the site is very informational. This is the goal and also requirement that CSDL members and web designers have been trying to push during the design and construction of the new site. Some of the sections in the site such as FAQ, Affiliate gave a major good impact on viewers. There were also some issues that the site web designers should notice.  The first concern was about the acronyms and abbreviation used for projects' name. Viewers felt uncomfortable because some of the abbreviation do not have explanations of what they stand for. One approach to correct this is to dedicate a section in every research page explaining about the meaning of its name. The second issue was about the length of the first page. More than a few of viewers felt that the first page should be simple and visible without scrolling. Is it a personal preference or a web standard? This is the question that requires web designers to do more researching and changing accordingly.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>Impression on the site as a whole </H4>

<UL>
  <LI>Good for luring prospective CSDL'ers</LI>
  <LI>Simple, yet elegant</LI>
  <LI>The introduction makes viewers want to look at all those neat acronyms and names on the left side of the main page. </LI>
  <LI>It is good to have a search engine. Very helpful.</LI>
  <LI>Up to date (according to the last-modified line) which is a good look.</LI>
  <LI>A nice research web page -- not too much flashy presentation, big lists of software and papers.</LI>
  <LI>This is clearly a busy group. There are a lot of projects going on, but most projects seem to have only on person working on them. The group has a clear sense of humor, but obviously (as the content of the web site indicates) takes research &#150; particularly the _process_ of research - very seriously</LI>
  <LI>Page come up after initiation of search is not consistent with other web pages.</LI>
  <LI>Does a good job of providing an overview of the group and contains most everything one would want to get at the details of what you are working on.</LI>
  <LI>Last updated, contact information are helpful</LI>
</UL>

<P>The comments in this section are key points that we are looking to determine the success or failure of our semester project of web design. The comments have proven the fact that our design of the site met the functional requirements we had set out at the planning stage earlier in the semester and our efforts putting into this project have been award. &quot;luring prospective CSDL'ers&quot;, &quot;providing a good overview of the group&quot; . . . are the goals that the site web designers have been trying to achieve. </P>

<H4>First impression of CSDL Research group after visiting the site </H4>

<UL>
  <LI>It seems like there are interesting research going on.</LI>
  <LI>There's quite a bit of research projects happening there</LI>
  <LI>Small, but doing a lot.</LI>
  <LI>Sounds like CSDL does a lot of cutting-edge development</LI>
  <LI>Knowledgeable of subject(s)</LI>
  <LI>&quot;The CSDL faculty is strong, at least Johnson, Jay and Russ are there.&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;I cannot say - in my mind it depends on more than a smartly presented set of web pages - I am not a particularly strong proponent of the 'perception is reality' school of thinking!&quot;</LI>
  <LI>The researches are impressive.</LI>
  <LI>A software engineering group.</LI>
  <LI>&quot;As a fellow faculty member at UH and someone who is interested in software development methods (from the Business Mgmt perspective), I'm happy to know you guys exist. During my 2 years at UH, I've been holed up in my office and really knew nothing about your center or activities. Since there might be some overlap / mutual interests, I think the site is valuable as a way of making yourselves known. It seems like you're doing and have done some interesting work.&quot;</LI>
 <LI>Looks like a bunch of smart individuals trying to find solutions for useful things (rather than high-end stuff that doesn't apply to the average surfing Joe).</LI>
  <LI>closely-knitted but very active, knowledgeable and well-connected research group</LI>
  <LI>Viable organization with good outside support. Not too big, about the right size to get something done.</LI>
  <LI>Well focused.</LI>
  <LI>Very productive and energetic group.</LI>
  <LI>Group achieved a right balance between working on products and processes</LI>
  <LI>&quot;A handsome, learned, widely published, brilliant associate professor, P.M.  Johnson&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;I didn't realize you'd been published so much and done all those presentations and lectures and everything. I am totally impressed! And here I thought you just lounged on the beach all day!</LI>
</UL>

<P>The comments in this section shows the site's ability to organize and convey the essential information about CSDL researches to viewers. From browsing, viewers could get a good overview of what has been done for the last 7 years and most of viewers were surprised of how much researches happening in the group. The site has demonstrated a very good image of the group to the world as being a very productive, energetic and knowledgeable group. The comments in this section could have a major influence on the CSDL's future expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H4>Suggestion on site improvement</H4>

<ul>
  <LI>The word &quot;Ohana&quot; on the Members page is OK in Hawaii, however for people coming to the site from other places, they would probably not get the point/meaning.</LI>
  <LI>If there is a director of the center, put it on the main page.</LI>
  <LI>Replace the abbreviation menu with more descriptive titles. Since this will occupy more space, I suggest that you organize the information in a hierarchy.</LI>
  <LI>Link to &quot;Research&quot; and &quot;Software Tools and Services&quot;. A short description of the contents could<BR> be displayed, rather than displaying cryptic initials in the main menu.</LI>
  <LI>Make more specific statement about related research and what position you are in now, even better, draw a comparison with any currently available commercial package (e.g.,MS scr_save?) if existing.</LI>
  <LI>In today's world, there are so many software products, if you can emphasize the unique, cool feature, that will fish in net surfers.</LI>
  <LI>More descriptions about the researches at the first levels. For example: There is not an explanation of what AEN stands for.</LI>
  <LI>More on-line demo</LI>
  <LI>Everything should be visible on the first page without scrolling</LI>
  <LI>The order of the sections on personal home page is somewhat incorrect. How about</LI>

  <LI>Sitemap button should have an ALT tag of &quot;Main/Sitemap&quot;.</LI>
  <LI>On the B/W Mac, one viewer complained for not being able read the text on the Member
    profiles pages after the background loaded</LI>
  <LI>Make the links with more contrast in the site map.</LI>
  <LI>A bit clustered? </LI>
  <LI>Logo is nice but viewer expected to see the text name of the group as a title on the home page, not in small text below the button area</LI>
  <LI>&quot;the bold headings in the right frame (&quot;Research&quot;, etc) might be links to the summary pages directly, instead of making me mentally sort the detailed menu on the left&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;I thought the text description on the summary pages were about a sentence too brief - I wanted to know more, but not *that* much more, not so much that I would really go through the 15 waits to see the detailed pages. If I already knew what the tools did (i.e. jWiz) it would be ok. Example: &quot;CSRS: a tool for collaborative software review&quot; - is it stand-alone? Is it suitable for big or small projects/groups? Does it require special infrastructure? I know I can go dig it up, but if I am just dropping in on a search, I don't have time to dig on everything.&quot;</LI>
  <LI>&quot;The words &#145;Open Source arrangement&#146; should be a link to more detailed information about what an open source arrangement is.&quot;</LI>
  <LI>The third paragraph on the right could have been removed or integrated with the content table. This would put your address, etc on the first page.</LI>
  <LI>To improve, however, the menu could have been framed with an enabled frameborder, preferably at the bottom. The one here takes up a bit too much space at the top, plus that the space between the top and the menu itself is bit too wide.</LI>
  <LI>Making a frame, and making it enabled border to facilitate web browser&#146;s search with more flexibility.</LI>
  <LI>&quot;I saw that the background is supposed to change everyday, but the light blue seemed a bit sterile and dull. Maybe it adds to readability for not being distracting, but I think that it's a bit too boring. Other than that, it looked nice for the 5 minutes I spent clicking around.&quot;</LI>
  <LI>Use the first photo as you have it and match the blue background for a solid back since you don't need the extra space the second photo takes up. Also, a GIF file at 72 dpi can look good and loads quicker than a JPEG</LI>
  <LI>Jwiz: ... Please enter in the URL of your .java file in the text field below, and press the Submit button to proceed.---&gt; How about: Please enter the URL...</LI>
  <LI>... as well as empirical approaches to improving ---&gt; How about: either improving or to improve.</LI>
  <LI>Make the navigation banner on top MUCH smaller, you loose too much screen real-estate.</LI>
  <LI>Check to see if browser is IE4 and if not redirect them to where they can download it.  Add lots of ActiveX and DHTML stuff. Also Microsoft Agents are nice. Add in a few LabCams, voice recognition, collaboration support, and real-time DNA computing demo.</LI>
  <LI>Use fonts and color to make it attractive.</LI>
  <LI>GIF buttons are 34 colors, could be reduced to 16 saving 33 1/3 % bandwidth</LI>
  <LI>Nice if there were links to papers etc. on Philip Johnson's page at least!</LI>
  <LI>Integrate the buttons to the site map</LI>
  <LI>The left bottom is empty. need put something there</LI>
  <LI>The color can be a little bit brighter.</LI>
  <LI>Overlap between research and tools are too large. I was expecting research description under research, and maybe tools to download on the tool button.</LI>
  <LI>More software screen shots and more downloadable or web-based software</LI>
  <LI>Pointers to other (non-CSDL) related research, papers, would be nice.</LI>
  <LI>At first blush the research topics and tools and services look like so much alphabet soup. Something like a tool tip on rollover (or status message) would help if it provided one-line definitions. Even the pages for these sections don't always explain the acronyms.</LI>
  <LI>The Doug Peebles backgrounds are nice but the small text is too hard to read in the dark areas. They should be bleached more (de-saturate and push towards white)</LI>
  <LI>The extra &quot;selected section&quot; cursor with the &quot;selected button&quot; mostly looks distracting (the 4 corner fillets). I don't think average viewers will understand the metaphor. (also it's not extensible in depth) Look for another way to locate the user in the site hierarchy. I understand it because I've struggled with the same problem. See http://www.kaiserhawaii.com for one way that I've dealt with it. Note the use of tabs and outline expansion. Subsection localization is tricky.</LI>
  <LI>I would like to also be able to click on the bold keyword in the content overview to access that area, seeing that is where I am<BR> reading about it, rather than having to find somewhere else to go to this site. (A very picky point though! :-)</LI>
  <LI>One usability problem occurs if you use a link in the FAQ part.There is no way back except you use the browsers back button and<BR> no chance to change to the homepage if the page was found using a search engine. You should back-link all pages at least using the text links of the homepage.</LI>

<P>The long list above are suggestions collected from viewers during the survey time. Many comments, if researched properly, will make major improvements to the current site. Some other suggestions are focused more on the cosmetic change of the site. Some are likely to be personal references. Yet, together they portrait what viewers expect to see and what are the most protruding points when browsing the site.&nbsp; Being able to understand web viewers' behaviors and expectation will help the web designers to bring the site closer and more pleasurable for viewers.&nbsp;&nbsp; </P>

<H3>Evaluation Analysis</H3>


<A NAME="statistics">
<H2>XI. Time and Work Product Analysis</H2></A>


<A NAME="groupdynamics">
<H2>X. Group Dynamics</H2></A>
<P>As our group found out, there are several new things that you can run into when working as a group rather than as an individual.</P>

<H3>Developing Roles</H3>
<P>We found that as the project wore on, each of us fell into job roles. It may sound bad, but it was actually a good thing. For one, we could usually tell who would be doing what job, and that person knew what areas were their responsibility. As an example of how work may end up being grouped, this is how our group work was divided:</P>
<P>Anne Disney - Anne, aside from being in the Aziza group, was also a CSDL member. Because she was familiar with CSDL she was in charge of going through the CSDL documents not related with specific projects and grouping them for inclusion into the new site. She was also our liaison with management. Many times she was able to discuss things at greater length with Dr. Johnson then we were able to cover in class meetings. This aspect of group-manager interaction was very useful and our group was fortunate that Anne was able to fill this role.</P>
<P>Jarrett Lee - Jarrett became the graphics guy. He would do most of the site work related to graphics. Most of the members' photographs have been touched up and all of the buttons are courtesy of him. He was also responsible for setting up the servlett to run the community services. When it was time for a formal presentation of this project, he assumed the role of group spokesperson.</P>
<P>Tuan Huynh - Tuan was responsible for the web server and the search engine. He was in charge of everything in these areas - from installation and setup to maintenance and documentation.</P>
<P>Jennifer Saito - Jenn was the group leader. She was responsible for most of the organizational work. She posted most of the meeting notes, to do lists, and standards. She also headed the class meetings with Dr. Johnson.</P>

<H3>Decisions</H3>
<P>As you might guess, making a decision as an individual is much easier than making a decision as a group, you only have yourself to consult. When it comes to making a group decision, there are many new things that come into play. For one thing, you need to remember that you must consult the group - while you can try to make unilateral decisions, this method is not the best for morale. After that you must be tactful and be considerate of the other members. Compromise and a willingness to adhere to decisions is also key. You are going to need to work closely with the rest of the group and open hostilities among members has never speeded up any process.</P>
<P>All of the niceties, though, require time and patience. When time is running out on the project, spending that valuable resource in this manner can become frustrating. The benefits of having a group all going in the same direction, though, are worth the effort.</P>

<H3>Coordinating Communication</H3>
<P>The same difficulty that occurs when making decisions applies to Coordination. As an individual, you tell yourself, "Okay, this is what I'm going to do" and do it. As a group, you come to the decision and then need to make sure you all know about the decision and follow it. This is why posting things like meeting notes, to do lists, and standards are important. This is also why compromise is important - you will all have to live with and abide by the decisions that the group has made.</P>


<A NAME="areasforimp">
<H2>XI. Areas For Improvement</H2></A>
<P>As much as we would like to say that our research project went smoothly and there is nothing that we could have done differently, that is not the case. There were several areas in which there was room for improvement.</P>

<H3>File Locking</H3>
<P>If you ask anyone in the Aziza group they will probably tell you that the next time, there should be a file locking mechanism. The reason for this is that because there were so many people making modifications to the files: us, Dr. Johnson, the CSDL members, there was always the danger that one of us would overwrite someone else's hard work.</P>
<P>What would happen is that we would make a copy of the file and work on it off-site, then replace the now-outdated file with a new one. If two people were doing this at the same time, the first person's work would be overwritten by the second person who copied their file back into the site.</P>
<P>The best that we could do was to send out e-mail letting everyone else know when we would be making changes to which documents. Making back-ups of the entire site gave us some peace of mind, but it would have been a lot easier if there were an alternate method of preventing file errors.</P>


<A NAME="conclusions">
<H2>XII. Conclusions</H2></A>
<P>As we look back on the process of the project, some things became apparent to us. The most striking of these has been that the outlook of CSDL itself has somewhat changed due to the update of the site. With the addition of the services section, a question that members are now asking themselves is "what can we make that is a service to the community?" So in a way, the types of projects CSDL may pursue in the future has been affected.</P>
<P>Overall, the group feels that the project has been a success. The Aziza group members are still alive and speaking to each other and have a completed project under CSDL's research section. We have walked away from this project with the knowledge of how to produce high-quality web sites, how to work as a group, and how to produce a research project.</P>
<P>CSDL has an updated site that is conceivably the best of its kind on the Web. Although there is still work to be done, they are all steps that will make the CSDL site into something better than it currently is.</P>

<P>Our design process started with interviews asking what it was that everyone expected from the new web site. It is 
therefore appropriate for us to end the process with another set of interviews, this time asking if the new web site met 
those expectations. It seems like everything has gone full circle, and in a way it has - those interviews were also the 
time to find out what more needed to be done with the site and what the next step for the site will be. As you can see, the 
end of one project is also the beginning of another.</P>

<A NAME="nextsteps">
<H2>XIII. Next Steps</H2></A>
<P>These are some ideas that the next group can take into consideration when deciding on what more can be done to improve the CSDL site.</P>
