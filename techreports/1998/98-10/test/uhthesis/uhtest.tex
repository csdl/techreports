it, but the introduction should introduce the concepts, backgrouand,
and goals of the dissertation.

War And Peace & Leo Tolstoy \\
The Great Gatsby & F. Scott Fitzgerald \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{A normalsize table.  There has been a complaint that table
captions are not single-spaced.  This is odd because the code
indicates that they should be.}
\end{table}
