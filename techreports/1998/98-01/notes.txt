Jwiz reported the error that a GUI component wasn't added to the
container.  It turns out that the author of the program called one of their 
own methods that took the component as an argument and called the add from
there.  As far as I know, there is no way to avoid this false positive
since the analysis is static and not performed during run-time.  This was
found in JavaSourceFrame.java with the field called inputUrl.

Mention that the warning of 'division result assigned to an int instead of
a float' arose out of my spending 20 minutes on the same problem.

another student spent 40 minutes debugging the problem of using == instead
of .equals.  (Found another that spent 5 minutes) (another took 15)

missing show statement on a Dialog box took 5 minutes to find and fix. 

15 minutes spent figuring out why GUI wasn't showing anything.  Forgot to
add a panel.



Could do a test for Date class?




Jwiz found the following, all were legit errors:
OutputDisplay.java:6: addActionListener not called on Button htmlButton.
OutputDisplay.java:7: addActionListener not called on Button cancelButton.
OutputDisplay.java:39: Multiple objects added to same region of borderlayout.
OutputDisplay.java:21: Gui component buttonPanel not added.
