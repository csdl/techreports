<TR>
<TH>Location</TH><TH>Description</TH></TR>
<TR>
<TD>1-6</TD>
<TD>"differences in recorded measures".  This is somewhat unclear.  It
seems as though you mean "the difference between recorded measures and
actual behavior".</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>1-7</TD>
<TD>"Spring of 1996".  This should be "Fall of 1996".</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2-3</TD>
<TD>The part of the first sentence after the "--" seems awkward.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2.1-4</TD>
<TD>"students record the phase each defect ..."  Seems as though this
should be "students record the phase in which each defect ..."</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2.1-4</TD>
<TD>"to ensure that those defects do not escape ..."    Maybe "to
ensure that when similar defects occur in future projects, they do not
escape ..."</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2.2-1</TD>
<TD>The term "yield" is used, but I don't think it has yet been defined.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2.2-2</TD>
<TD>"Industrial" would be more consistent in regards to both the
sentence and the rest of the paper than "industry"</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>3</TD>
<TD>"Modelling" in the heading should be "Modeling"</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>3.1-1</TD>
<TD>"the developer does intend to record their"  should perhaps be "the
developer does intend to accurately record his" (two changes to the phrase)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>3.3-4</TD>
<TD>"quality of the work records, overall PSP data quality ..."  perhaps
could be "quality of the work records produced in the collection phase,
overall PSP data quality ..."</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>4.1-3</TD>
<TD>"We" should be "she" (to be consistent with your use of "he" for the
named instructor later).</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>4.1-3</TD>
<TD>"... clearly inaccurate calculations from the dataset"  could be
"... clearly inaccurate calculations from the first dataset".</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>4.6.2-2</TD>
<TD>Last sentence is a little awkward, seemingly implying that the
case study outcomes do not appear to be the result of lack of instructor
familiarity with student quality.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>5.2.8-2</TD>
<TD>"but this one is extraneous".  Might sound more polite to say "but
for our purposes, this one is extraneous".</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>5.2.8-2</TD>
<TD>In earlier sections of the paper, specific field names are
italicized (for example, Date, Start, etc.)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>6-2</TD>
<TD>"First author" should be "second author".</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>6.1.2-1</TD>
<TD>Additionally, the PSP provides students with a framework for
empirically evaluating the usefulness of any other process improvement
techniques or programming methods they come across in the future.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>6.1.4-8</TD>
<TD>You say, "Furthermore, our original dataset is completely
consistent in size and values with other datasets submitted to the SEI for
this study".  It is unclear (to me) what you mean by "values".   It would
seem difficult for any dataset to be completely consistent with "other
datasets" used in the SEI study, since they used datasets from wildly
varying versions of the PSP.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>6.1.4-9</TD>
<TD>In the first sentence, "report" could be "note", since this fact
was already included earlier in the paper.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>6.1.5-1</TD>
<TD>If overall PSP data quality depends "completely" upon the data
quality from the collection phase, why do we bother with analysis phase
data quality?  Maybe "largely" would be better.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>6.1.5-8</TD>
<TD>The last sentence, after the "--" seems awkward.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD></TD>
<TD></TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>1-5</TD>
<TD>No citation is given for the second quote . It appears to 
have come from [6], but this is unclear.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2-3</TD>
<TD>"one form of experimental internal validity" might read better
with internal before experimental.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2.1-4</TD>
<TD>"excoriated" seems a bit pedantic. I know I had to look it up,
(though the meaning is mostly clear from the context)</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2.2-4</TD>
<TD>"the PSP that addressed felt development needs". Felt
seems like the wrong word choice.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>2.2-7</TD>
<TD>"Modhavji" -> "Madhavji"</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>4.2-3</TD>
<TD>"had a significant impact upon the overall data values."
What kind of impact? The way this stands it sounds
like the course was manipulated to improve the data. I
assume that it was to improve student learning, right?</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>4.6.1-3</TD>
<TD>"One rule, in
fact, does have the potential to produce this problem, but we used this rule in only case in the entire dataset
and our results are not sensitive to the specific value chosen."
Since it was only used once and has the potential to skew
data, why use this rule at all?</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>5.2.6-4</TD>
<TD>"48
of these errors were Defect Recording Log entries showing defects injected during the Compile and Test
phases, but not as a result of correcting other defects found during Compile or Test."
I can't seem to parse this sentence. Perhaps it is just
having been away from the PSP for 6 months...</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>6-2</TD>
<TD>Anne is referred to as first author, but on the title page you
are listed as first author...</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>abstract</TD>
<TD>The last four sentences are hard for me top parse and make sense of.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>abstract</TD>
<TD>What is the industrial experience we have with the PSP?</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>1-7</TD>
<TD>One of us taught ... We augmented      Sounds funny some how.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>5.2.5-4</TD>
<TD>Sentence fragment  "Similar factors surrounding the error in transferring data for size estimation."</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>5.2.5-5</TD>
<TD>Uses First, Secondly, Thirdly</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>5.2.6-6</TD>
<TD>Defect recorded on Wednesday with an injected phase of Code is ok even if the Coding phase ended on Monday.  The date of the defect is date detected not injected.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD>6-2</TD>
<TD>"The first author, for example, has used her...".  You've changed the order of the authors. It should read the second author</TD>
