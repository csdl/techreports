<td type=Description>Any kind of technical report, including a journal article, book, conference paper, etc.  It's not clear
to me that it is meaningful at this point to try to distinguish between these for the purposes of
process improvement: all the data that I collect for one seems to be equally meaningful for any
of the others.

<td type=Description>PSP Journal article.  
Goals: (1) Obtain rough metrics on writing productivity.
(2) Obtain data on kinds of writing errors I make.
(3) Identify some useful patterns for future writing.
(4) Track the time I spend, as a way of helping me
to work regularly on this paper.  I would like to get
at least one direct hour a day of work on this project.
(5) Get some baseline data to help me start learning
how to estimate the time I'll need for future writing 
projects.
