Over the past decade, running energy and water challenges has become a focal point for
sustainability efforts at both university and industry campuses. To provide an innovative information technology for engaging consumers in sustainability issues, we designed and implemented an open source serious game framework for sustainability called Makahiki. We ran sustainability challenges built on top of the Makahiki framework at three organizations in Fall 2012. They provides initial evidence regarding the ability of the Makahiki Framework to create engaging sustainability games in different environments. 

Upon review of the literature, we found little research or experience with formal framework
assessment. To address this, I designed an assessment method for serious game frameworks, called Serious Game Stakeholder Experience Assessment Method
(SGSEAM). SGSEAM is designed to provide detailed insight into the strengths and weaknesses of a serious game framework through a stakeholder perspective based approach. In my research, I will apply SGSEAM to Makahiki and another framework, BuildingOS, to gain better insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the two frameworks, as well as the assessment method itself.

The anticipated contributions of my research thus includes: the Makahiki serious game framework for sustainability; the SGSEAM assessment method; the insights into serious game framework design generated through application of SGSEAM to both Makahiki and another framework, and the insights into framework assessment design in general.
