\section{Research}

My research activities during the past five years involved the following major projects: the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory (CSDL), the Hackystat Project, the Renewable Energy and Island Sustainability Project (REIS), WattDepot, and eSpheres.

\subsection{CSDL}

I established the Collaborative Software Development Laboratory (CSDL) in 1991, shortly after joining the University of Hawaii faculty.  CSDL occupies a suite of offices in the POST Building (Room 307). The goal of CSDL is ``to create a physical, organizational, technological, and intellectual environment conducive to collaborative development of world-class software engineering skills. Through research, education, and technology transfer, we pursue this goal for CSDL members, the University of Hawaii, our affiliates, and the Hawaiian, U.S., and international software research and development communities.''

\paragraph{Students.} Since 2005, I have provided direct research supervision for 5 Ph.D. students, 7 M.S. students, and 4 B.S. students under the auspices of CSDL, as detailed in Figure \ref{fig:students}.

Finally, CSDL has hosted two foreign students since 2005: Christoph Lofi (University of Kaiserslautern, 2005), and Tryggvi Bjorgvinsson (University of Iceland, 2009). 

\paragraph{Website.} CSDL has an online presence at \url{http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu}. In 2008, a major redesign of the CSDL website was performed over the course of 12 months with the assistance of Pam Scott, an LIS student.  The CSDL website is now based on Plone and provides information regarding research and teaching activities, access to the CSDL tech report library, CSDL members, affiliate organizations, and news items regarding the lab, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:csdl}.

\paragraph{Funding.} Figure \ref{fig:funding} summarizes the 12 funding opportunities (1 pending, 6 awarded, 5 declined) that I have pursued since 2005. All of the funding opportunities were extramural, with the sole exception of Renewable Energy and Island Sustainability, which was a University of Hawaii intramural funding competition involving approximately 15 UH faculty.

\paragraph{Publications.}  Since 2005, members of CSDL have produced a total of 31 publications: 4 journal articles, 4 conference publications, 2 Ph.D. theses, 3 Ph.D thesis proposals, 4 M.S. theses, 3 Workshop publications, and 11 technical reports.  All of these are available online through the CSDL website.  Figure \ref{fig:pubs} lists these publications. 

My C.V. provides citations for my personal publications.  Since 2005, I have authored or co-authored 4 journal articles, 4 conference articles, and 3 Workshop articles. In addition, I have authored 6 technical reports not listed in my C.V.
