Adaptive Filtering of a Large Dynamic Database

Abstract:

	Information is being increasingly consolidated and digital on a global
level. This exponential increase in information available causes users to experience
information
overload. Adaptive filtering, aided by collaboration with colleagues, can
radically improve the overall interest level of information presented to a user. 
Using this
technique, users can spend their time understanding information, not wading
through it.

Keywords:

	adaptive interfaces, large databases, collaborative filtering, usenet

Problem:

	Description of the information overload problem, specifically Usenet.

	- Usenet cultural background
		- Anarchic, de-localized structure
		- Usenet as template for future networks

	- Problems with Usenet
		- Massive volume
		- Exponential growth

	- Usenet nuts & bolts
		- Newsgroup hierarchy
		- Threading

Solution:

	Explanation of the URN approach to solving the information overload
	problem.

	- Filtering
		- Kill files
		- Weighting functions
		- Why WF are better than kill files
		- Limitations of WF as quality selectors

	- Keyword generation
		- Automated keyword extraction, and limitations
		- Collaborative keyword processing

	- Adaptive WF generation
		- User's article ratings as training instances
		- Simple WF generation algorithm

Defense:

	Discussion and analysis of data from experiment.

	- Hypothesis

	- Method
		- Subject group
		- Length of experiment
		- Data collection technique
		- Type of data collected

	- Data
		- Graph of both interest and combined ratios over time for individuals
		- Graph of both interest and combined ratios over time for group
		- Data table?

	- Analysis
		- URN succeeded triumphantly! :)
		- [See RO 93-02 Section 3.5 for all possible outcomes]

Related Work:

	Show that this research is novel and important

	- strn: "Scan Threaded Read News"
	- grapeVINE ?
	- INFOSCOPE

Future Directions:

	Discuss evolving URN and relationship to other projects in CSDL

	- More use of IR knowledge (dead word list, suffix stripping, etc)
	- Better WF generation algorithm
	- Collaboration!
		- Recommending articles
		- Virtual moderation
		- Archiving, and shared archives
		- Link URN to CSRS and CLARE databases for further collaboration
