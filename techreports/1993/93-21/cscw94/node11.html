The results provide a strong indication that RESRA, SECAI, and CLARE
together provide a useful means for meaningful learning through
collaborative knowledge construction.  Users indicated that the RESRA
representation and the SECAI process model provided effective and novel
support for representing the meaning of an artifact and comparing their
interpretation to others. The results also indicated that users were not
quite satisfied with the user interface of the CLARE prototype. Analysis
of the experimental data provided new insight into the strategies used by
subjects as they constructed their representations.
<P>
However, the results also yielded a surprising paradox: though users rated
RESRA quite highly, they also made a substantial number of errors in its
application.  This raises the following question: is RESRA still useful for
its intended purpose, despite individual variations in its interpretation
and deviations from its intended usage?
<P>
The answer to this question appears to be a qualified yes, at least in the
current context of use. It is possible, particularly at the node primitive
level, for a learner to use a primitive incorrectly but usefully, simply
because node and link primitives force the learner to analyze the artifact
in terms of high level conceptual abstractions.  Analyzing the artifact in
this way provides a useful means to discover structural and content issues
that might not be perceived otherwise. In addition, incorrect use of
primitives also create collaborative opportunities, since the mistake might
be identified by another learner.  In many cases, the creation,
identification, discussion, and correction of representation errors can
facilitate meaningful learning both at the content level (by constructing
an awareness of the true nature of the artifact under study) and at a
meta-level (by constructing an awareness of the true nature of the
representational language.)
<P>
However, incorrect use of RESRA node primitives can also raise a major
barrier to effective use of the representation, since it can prevent
effective use of RESRA link primitives.  For example, an <EM>evidence</EM>
either <I>supports</I> or <I>counters</I> a <EM>claim</EM>.  At the node
primitive level, it may not be of great consequence to misrepresent a <EM>
claim</EM> as a <I>theory</I>.  However, this mistake has significant
consequences at the link primitive level, since the link primitives for
claims will not be available.  Thus, incorrect node primitive choices
can inhibit the creation of links between nodes, a characteristic found in
several subjects' representations.
<P>
During the design of RESRA, SECAI, and CLARE, we expected that the
summarization activity would be rather straightforward and that most
collaborative interaction would occur during argumentation and integration.
The results surprised us: most of the subjects' effort and collaborative
activity centered on summarization, and the summarization activity was not
at all straightforward: subjects made substantial errors both in choice of
RESRA primitives and in choice of the artifact content to summarize.  We
now realize that this seemingly straightforward process of reconstructing a
scientific paper within a simple representation language poses an awesome
challenge for many learners.  The ultimate success of a collaborative
learning environment has everything to do with how well it meets this
initial challenge.  We expect this problem will arise no matter what the
nature of the representational language. Rather than hope for a ``silver
bullet'' knowledge representation language, collaborative learning system
designers should instead ensure that process-level mechanisms exist to
overcome these breakdowns when they inevitably occur.
<P>
Finally, we want to point out the exploratory nature of the evaluation
results discussed thus far: our primary goal was to assess the the
viability and usability of the CLARE approach and to provide evidence and
insights about what learners might do when confronted with such a novel
learning environment. Through this study, we hope to provide a rich ground
on which more rigorous experimentation and field studies on
computer-supported collaborative learning can be formulated and performed.
