CLARE is grounded in two theoretical tenets: social constructionism
[<A HREF="node15.html#Berger66">4</A>, <A HREF="node15.html#KnorrCetina81">13</A>] and the assimilation theory of cognitive
learning [<A HREF="node15.html#Ausubel63">3</A>, <A HREF="node15.html#Novak84">17</A>]. The former affirms the social nature of
learning and the imperative of engaging learners in collaborative knowledge
construction, as opposed to merely information sharing. It provides a
philosophical foundation for the learning activities that CLARE
supports. The latter is centered on the concept of <I>meaningful
learning</I>, which defines learning as an ongoing process of relating new
knowledge to what the learner already knows. Meaningful learning emphasizes
explicit use of meta-knowledge to enhance human learning. Toward this end,
two meta-cognitive strategies have been proposed: <I>concept mapping</I>
and <I>Vee diagramming</I> [<A HREF="node15.html#Gowin81">9</A>, <A HREF="node15.html#Novak84">17</A>]. While the effectiveness
of concept mapping is well supported empirically
[<A HREF="node15.html#Cliburn90">6</A>, <A HREF="node15.html#Novak90">16</A>, <A HREF="node15.html#Roth92">18</A>], its inadequacy as a collaborative learning
tool and its lack of computerized support have directly prompted the
current research.
<P>
RESRA is related to <I>schema theory</I> in cognitive psychology, which
contends that human minds store and retrieve knowledge about the external
world in terms of abstract chunks called schemas [<A HREF="node15.html#Stillings87">21</A>] and
that the schema plays in an essential role in the selection, abstraction,
interpretation, and integration of information [<A HREF="node15.html#Alba83">1</A>].  RESRA is
similar to some knowledge representation research in AI, particularly RA
[<A HREF="node15.html#Swaminathan90">22</A>], which proposes an episodic representation for
research literature.
<P>
A number of semi-structured representation schemes are found in the
literature, for example, IBIS [<A HREF="node15.html#Kunz70">14</A>, <A HREF="node15.html#Conklin88">7</A>], DRL[<A HREF="node15.html#Lee91What">15</A>],
Toulmin's rhetorical model [<A HREF="node15.html#Toulmin58">23</A>, <A HREF="node15.html#CavalliSforza92">5</A>].  RESRA
differs from those schemes in that, among other things, it is fully
integrated with an explicit process model (i.e., SECAI) that defines how
the scheme is to be used.
<P>
CLARE falls into a special type of computer-based learning environments
called <I>collaborative knowledge construction tools</I>, as contrasted
with information sharing tools, such as EIES [<A HREF="node15.html#Hiltz88">10</A>], Intermedia
[<A HREF="node15.html#Yankelovich88">25</A>], and Mosaic [<A HREF="node15.html#Andreessen93">2</A>]. CLARE is similar to
CSILE (Computer-Supported Intentional Learning Environment)
[<A HREF="node15.html#Scardamadia93">20</A>, <A HREF="node15.html#Scardamadia92">19</A>] in that both systems reify a social
constructionist paradigm and provide an environment conducive to
collaborative knowledge construction. However, CLARE's representation
scheme provides a meta-cognitive framework for collaborative learning,
while CSILE's four thinking types (``I know,'' ``high-level questions,''
``plan,'' and ``problem'') only allow learners to categorize their
intentions. In addition, CLARE provides an explicit process model to
control the application of the representation and the process of
collaboration.
