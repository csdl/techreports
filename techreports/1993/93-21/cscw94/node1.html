Current computer-supported collaborative learning systems focus on
improving shared access to information, people, and media. One example is
virtual classroom systems, which range from plain e-mail, computer
conferencing, and bulletin-board systems, to more specialized systems such
as EIES [<A HREF="node15.html#Hiltz88">10</A>].  Virtual classrooms allow learners to interact with
their peers and instructors, as well as access online information in a
manner independent of time and geographic location. They augment
traditional classroom learning by removing the requirement for physical
co-presence and by improving access to information and people.
<P>
A second example is hypermedia systems, such as Intermedia
[<A HREF="node15.html#Yankelovich88">25</A>] and Mosaic [<A HREF="node15.html#Andreessen93">2</A>]. These systems
typically provide distributed mechanisms for structuring large information
spaces. They also provide mechanisms for presentation and integration of
various media formats, including text, graphics, voice, and video.
Hypermedia systems improve access by removing the constraint of text-based
interaction, broadening the scope of sharable information, and reducing the
effort required to make information sharable.
<P>
Although virtual classrooms and hypermedia systems are successful in
improving information access, they do not typically offer explicit
mechanisms to help learners better interpret and assimilate the
information, the context surrounding its creation and use, and the
perspectives on it of the author or other learners. Simply improving
information access without supporting learning leads directly to the
problems of ``information overload'' and ``lost-in-hyperspace''.  In the
coming age of the Information Superhighway, it will be essential to
explicitly support learning as well as access.  Software systems must
provide users with structural and process-level support on how to
comprehend new information, how to relate new information to what they
already know, and how to identify, compare, and integrate different
interpretations of the same information.  In other words, how to
meaningfully learn in an environment of vastly improved information access.
<P>
This paper presents our approach to providing computational support for
meaningful learning through a process of collaborative knowledge
construction.  The next section presents three major components of our
approach: a representation language for meaningful learning called RESRA, a
process model to guide the use of RESRA called SECAI, and a computational
environment designed to support this language and process called CLARE.
The following section describes our evaluation of this approach through
about 300 hours of classroom usage. Analysis of the results indicates that
the approach is effective in facilitating meaningful learning. It also
reveals the strategies of knowledge construction used by learners, and
several significant obstacles to meaningful learning within this paradigm.
The following section briefly connects this research to related work in
learning theory, cognitive psychology, and computer-supported cooperative
work. The final section revisits the essential contributions of this
research and outlines promising future research directions.
