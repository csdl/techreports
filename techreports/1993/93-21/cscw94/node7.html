Two sets of experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
CLARE as an environment for meaningful learning through collaborative
knowledge construction.  For this evaluation, three types of data were
collected:
<P>
<UL><LI> <I>Assessment:</I> Gathered through a questionnaire administered
  after each experiment session;<LI> <I>Outcome:</I> Online CLARE database created during each session;
  and<LI> <I>Process: </I> Gathered automatically through the built-in
  instrumentation mechanism. 
</UL>
<P>
The subjects were 24 computer science students who were enrolled in two
software engineering courses in the Department of Information and Computer
Science at the University of Hawaii in Fall, 1993. The task was
collaborative analysis and deliberation of research papers in software
engineering using CLARE. The first experiment involved 16 upper-level
undergraduate students, who were evenly divided into four groups. The
experiment was repeated three times with three different research papers.
The second experiment involved 8 graduate students, who were evenly divided
into two groups. This experiment was repeated twice with two different
research papers. All experimental sessions lasted approximately one week. A
few sessions lasted two to three days longer due to interruptions from
other class activities.
<P>
The experiments were conducted between September and October, 1993. The
subjects collectively accumulated about 300 hours of usage time, and
created about 1,800 nodes with a total text size of nearly 400 kilobytes. A
total of over 80,000 timestamps were gathered during these sessions. Figure
