The author of a complex hypertext document is often faced with the
problem of conveying the document's meaning to future readers through a

Issues of remote deictic reference arising from an application in legal

NOTECARDS is an extensible environment designed to help people
formulate, structure, compare, and manage ideas.  NOTECARDS provides the
user with a "semantic network" of electronic NOTECARDS interconnected by
typed links.  The system provides tools to organize, manage, and display
the structure of the network, as well as a set of methods and protocols for
creating programs to manipulate the information in the network.  NOTECARDS
in currently being used by more than 50 people engaged in idea processing
tasks ranging from writing research papers through designing parts for
photocopiers.
   In this paper we briefly describe NOTECARDS and the conceptualization of
idea processing tasks that underlies its design.  We then describe the
NOTECARDS user community and several prototypical NOTECARDS applications.
Finally, we discuss what we have learned about the system's strengths and
weaknesses from our observations of the NOTECARDS user community.} )

Hypertext systems like NOTECARDS provide facilities for authoring large
networks.  But they provide little support for the associated task of
making these networks intelligible to future readers.  Presentation
conventions may be imported from other related media, but because the
conventions have not yet been negotiated within a community of hypertext
readers and writers, they provide only a partial solution to the problem of
guiding a reader through an existing network of information.  In this
paper, we will discuss how a recent facility, Guided Tours, has been used
to organize hypertext networks for presentation.  The use of Guided Tours
in NOTECARDS has exposed a set of authoring issues, and has provided us
with examples of solutions to the problems associated with on-line
presentations.} )

NOTECARDS is a general hypermedia environment designed to help people
work with ideas.  Its intended users are authors, designers, and other
intellectual laborers engaged in analyzing information, designing
artifacts, and generally processing ideas.  The system provides these users
with a variety of hypermedia-based tools for collecting, representing,
managing, interrelating, and communicating ideas.
   This paper presents the NOTECARDS system as a foil against which to
explore some of the major limitations of the current generation of
hypermedia systems.  In doing so, this paper highlights seven of the major
issues that must be addressed in the next generation of hypermedia systems.
These seven issues are: search and query, composite nodes, virtual
structures, computational engines, versioning, collaborative work, and
tailorability.  For each of these issues, the papers describes the
limitations inherent in NOTECARDS and the prospects for doing improving the
situation in future systems.} )

NOTECARDS is an information structuring system developed in the
Intelligent Systems Lab at Xerox PARC.  A major design goal has been that
NOTECARDS be an adaptable system, that is, tunable or customizable by users
for particular applications and styles of use.  In this paper, we describe
four ways that a system can be adaptable: (1) it can have a flexible
underlying conceptual model, (2) its behavior can be parametrized, (3) it
can be integratable with other facilities, and (4) it can be tailorable,
i.e. users themselves can add new functionality.  We discuss the
adaptability of NOTECARDS according to each of the above criteria.
Finally, an example of large scale tailoring in NOTECARDS is presented.} )

  pages =	{253-268}, 
  annote =	{
Hypertext is a technology well-suited to exploring different kinds of
representational problems.  It can be used first as an informal mechanism
to describe the attributes of objects and to capture relationships between
the objects.  Then hypertext structures can be constrained into a more
formal representation of a domain, model, or analytic technique.  A range
of strategies for using hypertext can be employed to describe a problem and
converge on an appropriate representation; competing representations can be
informally evaluated to compare their relative expressive power.
   This paper discusses several applications that have used NOTECARDS, a
hypertext idea processing system, to tackle representation problems.
Examples from each problem domain have been collected using the hypertext
system as the initial acquisition vehicle.  Subsequent analysis using
hypertext structuring tools has revealed the semantics of each problem
domain enabling the development of competing representations.  Abstraction
of the structure and form of these representations can be used to guide
system extensions.  These tailored extensions support the evaluation of a
representation's relative merits; the representation that has been
developed in response to a particular problem can be applied to analogous
problems to determine the limits of its scope.
   The first application described in this paper models a type of policy
decision-making process; the second looks at approaches to representing the
logical structure of an argument; and the third suggests some methods for
capturing the structure of a political organization as an alternative to a
conventional database design.  The applications are discussed in terms of
the issues they raise and the trade-offs they involve, how hypertext-based
tools have been used to exploit the representations, and the solutions and
techniques that have been developed in the process of creating each
representation.} )

part of a more comprehensive effort of GMD-IPSI, where the hypertext
authoring system SEPIA (Structured Elicitation and Processing of Ideas for
Authoring) is developed.  AAA will be used for writing and design
experiments the results of which will be used in the design of SEPIA. It is
designed to support the creation of argumentation patterns in accordance
with the IBIS/PHI (Procedural Hierarchical IBIS) model combined with a
micro argumentation structure according to Toulmin.  For rapid prototyping
purposes it has been implemented as a hypertext system using the Writing
Environment WE developed at UNC.
   AAA uses a combination of different independent but cooperating modes of
operation dedicated to different cognitive tasks of the argumentative
writing process.  The entire argumentation structure is represented as a
layered network of typed nodes and links in which different layers
correspond to different levels of abstraction.} )

A Few representations have been used for capturing design rationale.  To
understand their scope and adequacy, we need to know how to evaluate them.
In this article, we propose a framework for evaluating the expressive
adequacy of design rationale representations.  This framework is built by
progressively differentiating the elements of design rationale that, when
made explicit, support an increasing number of the design tasks.  Using
this framework, we present and assess DRL (Decision Representation
Language), a language for representing rationales that we believe is the
most expressive of the existing representations.  We also use the framework
to assess the expressiveness of other design rationale representations and
compare them to DRL.  We conclude by pointing out the need for articulating
other dimensions along which to evaluate design rationale representations.} )

WE is a hypertext writing environment that can be used to create both electronic
and printed documents.  It is intended for professionals who work within a computer
network of professional workstations.  Since writing is a complex mental activity that
uses many different kinds of thinking, WE was designed in accord with an explicit
cognitive model for writing.  That model raises several important questions for both
electronic and printed documents.  The paper includes a discussion of the underlying
cognitive model, a description of WE as it currently exists and as it will be extended
in the near future, as well as a brief outline of experiments being conducted to
evaluate both the model and the system.  It concludes by re-examining some of the
issues raised by the cognitive model in light of WE, especially the role of constraints
in hypertext systems.} )
