\section* {ABSTRACT}

The importance of formal technical review and its benefits have been
well documented, and yet there is a proliferation of methods in
practice with varying degrees of success.

This paper discusses a new approach to assess and study various
aspects associated with the effectiveness of current review methods.
Our basic approach is to use a computer assisted review system (CSRS)
equipped with mechanisms to model different review methods and 
at the same time capture fine-grained measurements
about the product and the process of the review.
Through suitable experimental design, these data can be used to
compare the different methods to each other.
