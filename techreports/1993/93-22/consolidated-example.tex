{\large\bf Issue 634: Ordering of field-IDs}
\hrule \medskip

\begin{llist}
\sectiontitle{Sources:} t*node-schema!combine-field-IDs
\sectiontitle{Lines:} 8
\sectiontitle{Consensus:} 1 (confirm), 0 (disconfirm), 4 (neutral)
\sectiontitle{Description:} The field-IDs ordering is incorrect. Field-IDs in
superschemas should come first.

\sectiontitle{Discussion:}
\begin{itemizenoindent}
\item Comment 522 (follow-up of Issue 350): Are
    field-IDs supposed to be ordered? Is this part of the
    specification for this slot, or is it a convienient
    implementation fact that has been taken advantage of?

  
\item Comment 530 (follow-up of Comment 522): I guess
    this requirement is emerged due to node-buffer
    specification/implementation. The nbuff follows strict
    ordering of the field-IDs in a node instance.  If you
    mesh up this ordering, you mesh up your nbuff.
\end{itemizenoindent}

\sectiontitle{Decision:}
This will be fixed.  Also, the mapc form should be eliminated, since append
is used to concatenate the two lists. 
\end{llist}
