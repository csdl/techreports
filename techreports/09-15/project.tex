\section{Project Description}

The introduction should explain what the smart grid is, a little of the recent history, and why it is important. The goal of this research is to: (a) generate some scientific data that can be used to inform policy and design decisions; (b) generate some technological infrastructure that can support future experimentation; (c) generate some methods for inquiry; (d) build a community of scientific researchers that can collaborate together.

We also want to make the point that Hawaii has some unique attributes for this kind of experimentation: it has a wealth of renewable energy sources including solar, wind, wave, and geothermal.  In addition, it is currently 90\% dependent on fossil fuels, and these fuels are very expensive, making our electrical costs the most expensive in the nation.  As a result of these factors, renewable energy has the potential to be more cost-effective in Hawaii.  Also, the grid is closed, making it easier to model and analyze. 

We also want to demonstrate alignment with the goals of the program.

``HCC research explores and improves our understanding of new
human-computer and human-human interactions, collaboration, andcompetition, developing systems that are aware of their social surroundings
and of the conceptualizations, values, preferences, abilities, special
needs, and diverse ranges of capability of the people that use them.''
