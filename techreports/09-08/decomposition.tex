\chapter{Dimensionality reduction (time-series decomposition) and indexing.}
The problem addressed in this chapter is the approximation (lossy compression) of a time series data in a way which allows to maintain a fast random access, comparison and indexing of the time-series with minimal errors. There are many approximation proposed in the research literature and the Figure \ref{fig:approximations} from \cite{citeulike:2821475} illustrates their hierarchy.

All of the methods essentially aiming to overcome the problem of the high-dimensionality of the time series data in order to utilize data-mining, indexing and clustering algorithms.
