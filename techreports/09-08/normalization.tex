\section{Time series normalization}

Normalization is a mathematical transformation of time series from one value domain into another value domain with a purpose to obtain a specific set of statistical features such as a limit of values, a certain variance, standard deviation or average for the normalized time series. The operation usually carried in one or two steps and transforms each of the elements $x_{i} \in X$ of input sequence into the element $x_{i}^{'} \in X^{'}$. There are different types of normalization known:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Normalization into an Interval \cite{citeulike:4295248} \cite{citeulike:2753031}
  \item Normalization to Sum 1
  \item Normalization to Euclidean Norm 1
  \item Normalization to Zero Mean
  \item Normalization to Zero Mean and Unit Standard Deviation \cite{citeulike:3815880}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Normalization into an Interval}
This type of normalization procedure ensures that all elements of an input vector are scaled proportionally into an output vector with predefined upper and lower limits.
Let's $L_{min}$ to be a desired lower limit, $L_{max}$ to be a upper limit and let's $x_{max} = \max \left\{ x_{i}, x_{i} \in X \right\}$ and $x_{min} = \min \left\{ x_{i}, x_{i} \in X \right\}$. Than
\[
x_{i}^{'} = \frac{ (x_{i}-x_{min}) (L_{max} - L_{min}) }{ x_{max} - x_{min} } + L_{min	}, \: i \in \mathbb{N}
\]
is a normalization procedure.

\subsection{Normalization to Sum 1}
This type of normalization transforms the vector $x$ into $x^{'}$ where all elements sum up to 1:
\[
1 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}
\]
The transformation procedure is:
\[
x_{i}^{'} = \frac{ x_{i} }{ \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} }
\]

\subsection{Normalization to Euclidean Norm 1}
This normalization procedure transforms the input vector proportionally into an output vector with a Euclidean norm of 1:
\[
1 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2}
\]
The transformation procedure is:
\[
x_{i}^{'} = \frac{ x_{i} }{ \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^2 }
\]

\subsection{Normalization to the zero mean}
This method ensures that the mean of the normalized vector will be approximately $0$. The mean of the original vector $X$ of length $N$ can be calculated as:
\[
\mu_{X} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}
\]
and the normalization procedure is:
\[
x_{i}^{'} = x_{i} - \mu, \: i \in \mathbb{N}
\]


\subsection{Normalization to Zero Mean and Unit Standard Deviation}
This type of normalization taken from the \cite{citeulike:3815880} and ensures that all elements of the input vector are transformed into the output vector which mean is approximately $0$ while the standard deviation (and variance) are in a range close to $1$.
This procedure uses mean $\mu$ and standard deviation which calculated as 
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_{i} - \mu)^{2} }{ N - 1 } }
\]
or equivalently
\[
\sigma = \sqrt{ \frac{
                  N \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i}^{2}  \right) - 
                  \left( \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_{i} \right) ^{2}
                }{
                  N(N-1)
                }  
          }
\]
The normalization itself is 
\begin{equation}
x_{i}^{'} = \frac{x_{i} - \mu}{\sigma}, \: i \in \mathbb{N}
\end{equation}
and yields the vector $x_{i}^{'}$ such as $\mu \approx 0$ and $\sigma \approx 1$.

According to the most of the recent work \cite{citeulike:3815880} \cite{citeulike:2821475} \cite{citeulike:3978002} this type of time-series normalization provides the best known transformation of the raw time-series which preserves original time-series features which of course should be taken carefully. Nevertheless, the article by Lin et al. \cite{citeulike:2821475} explains multiple reasons and custom solutions for a number of cases when the zero mean and unit standard deviation normalization fails.
