<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "motivation">Motivation for Defmacs</a></h2>

One advantage of the Leap toolkit is its independence from
specific work product development environments as well as operating
system platforms.  The Leap tools can be used regardless of whether you are
using the Visual Studio to develop Visual Basic programs, or Framemaker to
develop a requirements specification document.

<p>

However, this independence comes at a cost: if you discover the need to
record some time, size or defect data while working in one of these
environments, you must switch to the appropriate Leap tool to record the
information and then switch back to the environment you were working in.
This "context switching" can be somewhat disruptive. In addition, it can
sometimes involve manually copying (or cutting and pasting) information
from the environment into the Leap tool, which
can seem time-consuming and lame. 

<p>

For example, although Leap tools such as Honu and Mano can be used to
collect defects, in some cases defects can be collected more efficiently by
direct integration of Leap-aware facilities into the software development
environment.  Defmacs is one example of such an approach.  Defmacs is a
system that extends the XEmacs programmable text editor to support more
efficient collection of structured defect information for use in Leap.
Specifically, Defmacs is designed to support <em>in-process</em> defect
collection.  In-process defect collection occurs when the developer notices
in the midst of some task that a defect has occurred and wishes to record
information about that defect, then return quickly to the task at hand.
(In-process defect collection contrasts with <em>technical review</em>, in
which the task at hand <em>is</em> the collection of defects.)

<p>

Let's begin by showing what Defmacs looks like:

<p>
<img src="screens/defmacs-intro.gif">
<p>

This image shows a simple example use of Defmacs.  In this case, the user
is editing a file using XEmacs and discovers that some files are named
incorrectly.  To record the defect, the user types <tt>c-c c-[</tt> which
splits the screen in two and displays a Defmacs window in the bottom half
of the window. After entering in the relevant data, the screen looks as
shown above. Typing <tt>return</tt> saves the defect information out to a
file that can be read by the Leap toolkit, and returns the window
configuration to its original state for continued work.

<P>

The principal advantage of Defmacs (and other similar Leap-compliant software)
is their ability to exploit tight integration with the actual work product
development environment. For example, Defmacs can be configured to
automatically record data such as the file name and location of the defect,
based upon the file that was being edited at the time Defmacs was invoked.
Defmacs also has an interface to the Emacs compilation mode which allows the
user to record a compilation error as a defect with a single mouse click.

<p>

Defmacs has limitations as well. It does not support analysis of defect
data, only collection.  In order to perform analysis, the user must load
the files containing defect data produced by Defmacs into the Leap
toolkit. Furthermore, Defmacs-generated defect data is stored in a special
form of Leap data file that can be read by Leap tools but not written by
them. Thus, defect information transfer is "one-way", from Defmacs to Leap.
While you can record a defect in Defmacs, load the resulting file into
Leap, and display it using Honu, the reverse is not possible in the
current implementation. 

<p>

The remainder of this chapter goes into more detail on how to use Defmacs.
The next two sections explain how to download Defmacs and configure
it for use with XEmacs. The following section explains how to use
Defmacs during XEmacs editing sections. 

<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "download">Downloading Defmacs</a></h2>

Downloading Defmacs involves the following steps:

<ol>

<p><li> Download and install XEmacs 20.3 or later if 
you do not already have it available locally. XEmacs is available 
from  <A HREF="http://www.xemacs.org/">http://www.xemacs.org/</A>.
The current release of Defmacs does not run on GNU Emacs, although
a port is under way. 

<p><li> Download the Defmacs package. You do this via
   anonymous FTP to <A
   HREF="ftp://ftp.ics.hawaii.edu/pub/csdl/defmacs/">ftp://ftp.ics.hawaii.edu/pub/csdl/defmacs/</A>, and download the files you find there into a local directory,
such as "~/Defmacs/". The following files are available, where
"X.X.X" is replaced by a version number such as "2.4.3".
<p>
<ul>
<li> <tt>dfm-X.X.X.elc</tt>  The Defmacs binaries.
<li> <tt>dfm-X.X.X.pdf</tt>  The Defmacs design document.
<li> <tt>dfm-X.X.X-src.zip</tt>  The Defmacs source code.
<li> <tt>sample.emacs</tt>  Example Emacs code for installing Defmacs.
<li> <tt>sample-defs.leap</tt>  Example Leap definitions for testing your 
                                installation. 
</ul>
</ol>
Once you've downloaded and installed XEmacs, and downloaded the
Defmacs distribution, the next step is to configure Defmacs for
your local environment. This is explained in the next section. 

<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "configure">Configuring Defmacs</a></h2>

A primary advantage of an integrated system such as Defmacs is that it can
be very simple and efficient to use under normal circumstances. To achieve
this, Defmacs must be initially configured to operate effectively in your
particular development environment. This initial configuration process is
normally quite simple, and involves the following steps:

<ul>
<li> Loading the Defmacs executable
<li> Specifying Leap definition files
<li> Specifying the DRL file directory
<li> Binding Defmacs commands to keystrokes and menus
<li> Setting which defects fields to display
<li> Setting up Defmacs for compilation mode
</ul>

Each of these configuration issues are discussed at length below. 
The results of this configuration process are typically expressed
as a set of function invocations that are called within your .emacs
file.  The file 'sample.emacs' included with the distribution 
provides an example configuration suited to most users, albeit with minor
modifications.  



<p><h3><A NAME = "executable">Loading the Defmacs executable</a></h3>


The Defmacs executable has the suffix <tt>.elc</tt>. Let's assume that the
current version of Defmacs is 2.4.1 and you've stored it in ~/Defmacs/.  A
good way to ensure that Defmacs is automatically loaded every time 
you run XEmacs is to place the following form into your .emacs
file:

<P>
<PRE>
(require 'dfm "~/Defmacs/dfm-2.4.1.elc")
</PRE>

This will load the defmacs executable each time you start emacs. Using 
<tt>require</tt> simply ensures that defmacs will be loaded at most once. 

<p><h3><A NAME = "tables">Specifying Leap definition files</a></h3>

One way that Defmacs makes defect entry easier is through 
pop-up menus containing the names of your defined projects,
document IDs, document types, defect types, and checklists. 
Defmacs obtains this information by reading Leap files containing
these definitions.  These files can also contain other Leap
data, such as data on defects, times, and sizes, but this
non-definition data will be ignored.  Defmacs treats these
Leap files as read-only can does not modify their contents
in any way.  

<p>
<!-- this function name should be changed ->

Any number of Leap files containing definitions can be read into Defmacs
using the function dfm*user*set-table-files.  This function takes a list of
strings, each string naming a Leap table file. For example:

<P>
<PRE>
(dfm*user*set-table-files '("/group/csdl/Leap/group-defs.leap"
                            "/home/johnson/Leap/personal-defs.leap"))
</PRE>

<p>
These files are not loaded immediately; instead, they are loaded when 
Defmacs is actually invoked.  This function allows you to specify
your definitions in your .emacs file but not incur the overhead of
loading them unless and until you actually run Defmacs.

<p><h3><A NAME = "directory">Specifying the DRL file directory</a></h3>

We noted above that Defmacs treats Leap files as read-only and does not
alter their contents. How then, does Defmacs record defects and how do
these defects get to Leap?

<p>

The answer is that while Defmacs can only read Leap files, it can both read
and write a specialized kind of file called a "DRL" file.  DRL files store
the defects entered using Defmacs. And, importantly, DRL files conform to a
syntactic subset of Leap data file syntax, so they can be read into Leap.
However, you should realize that DRL files can only be read by Leap---if
you read a DRL file into Leap, modify it, and write it out again, it will
no longer be usable in Defmacs.  (At some point, Defmacs may be redesigned
to support general reading and writing of Leap data files, at which point
this problem will go away.)

<p>

DRL files have some other interesting characteristics. For example, 
Defmacs automates most of the details of file naming, creation and saving.
However, we have found that it is quite useful to have Defmacs store DRL
files in a single directory. (Defmacs attaches a timestamp to each file
name so that under normal circumstances, files will not be clobbered.)
To set the DRL directory, use the function dfm*user*set-drl-directory,
which takes a string naming a directory as its argument. For example:
<P>
<PRE>
(dfm*user*set-drl-directory "/home/4/johnson/Leap/DRLs/")
</PRE>


<p><h3><A NAME = "binding">Binding Defmacs commands to keystrokes and menus</a></h3>

An important way to improve the usability of Defmacs is minimize the amount
of typing required.  You can accomplish this by binding defmacs commands to
keystrokes.

<p>

The most appropriate set of keybindings is highly contingent upon
each user's  environment and the keybindings already in use, so 
Defmacs does not automatically define keybindings. The 
bindings are typically placed in your .emacs file. 
Here are some example bindings to use as a guide. 
<P>

<PRE>
(global-set-key "\C-c\C-k" 'dfm*binding*open-drl-file)
(global-set-key "\C-c\C-]" 'dfm*xemacs*add-defect)
(global-set-key "\C-c\C-l" 'dfm*xemacs*display-current-defect)
(global-set-key "\C-c\C-k" 'dfm*xemacs*open-drl-file)
</PRE>

<P>

For those in a window environment, it can also be useful to 
set up a menu-based interface.  In XEmacs, for example, the
following code adds a ``Defmacs'' menu with selections for
the common Defmacs functions:

<P>
<PRE>
(add-menu-item '("Defmacs") "Load Defmacs" 'sample-load-defmacs t)
(add-menu-item '("Defmacs") "Install compilation mode" 'dfm*compilation*install-defmacs t)
(add-menu-item '("Defmacs") "Open DRL File" 'dfm*xemacs*open-drl-file t)
(add-menu-item '("Defmacs") "Add Defect" 'dfm*xemacs*add-defect t)
(add-menu-item '("Defmacs") "Display Current Defect" 'dfm*xemacs*display-current-defect t)
</PRE>
<P>


<p><h3><A NAME = "visible">Setting which defect fields to display</a></h3>

The Leap defect format contains over a dozen different fields for each
defect entry. In many situations, you may not want to show each of these
fields in Defmacs. (For example, the date field is filled automatically, so
you almost never want to display this field.)  Other fields may be
important to some developers but superfluous to others, such as the
"Severity" field.  Defmacs allows you to configure which fields are
displayed with the <tt>set-visible-fields</tt>
function.  Here is an example call:

<p>
<pre>
(dfm*xemacs*set-displayed-fields '("DocID" 
                                   "Project"
 		                   "FixTime"
				   "Location" 
				   "Occurrences"
				   "DefType"
				   "Description"
				   "Injected"
				   "Removed"
				   ))
</pre>
<p>

To use this function effectively, you need to the set
of defined field name strings.  The value of the variable
<tt>dfm*user*defect-field-labels</tt> is a list of all the currently
defined defect field names. In Defmacs version 2.4.1, for example, this
variable's value was

<pre>
("Date" "Project" "DocID" "FixTime" "Location" "Occurrences" "DefType" "Severity" 
 "Description" "Valid" "UserCreated" "UserFound" "Injected" "Removed" 
 "Checklist" "FixDefect" "StartTime")
</pre>


<p><h3><A NAME = "compilation">Setting up Defmacs for compilation mode</a></h3>

Defmacs provides an interface to Emacs compilation mode. This interface
allows you to move the mouse over an error presented in the compilation
buffer, and press shift-middle mouse to send it to Defmacs as a new defect.
This feature is discussed in more detail in the section <a
href="defmacs.html#compile-mode">Recording compilation mode defects</a>.

<p>

Configuring Defmacs for compilation mode is quite simple; just invoke the
function <tt>dfm*compilation*install-defmacs</tt>.


<p><h3><A NAME = "emacs">A sample .emacs file</a></h3>

Although the preceding explanation for Defmacs configuration may
have seemed long and complicated, actually performing the configuration
is quite simple. Typically, you just insert a few calls into your
.emacs file.  Here is an example Defmacs configuration from the 
sample.emacs file:

<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "using">Using Defmacs</a></h2>

After configuring Defmacs and placing the results in your .emacs file, 
you are now ready to use it.  (Note that you may want to save your
.emacs, exit XEmacs, and reinvoke XEmacs to make sure your 
configuration functions are loaded and called correctly.)  This section
describes the normal Defmacs operations used during a session:

<ul>
<li> Opening a DRL file.
<li> Adding a defect.
<li> Navigating the defects in a DRL file.
<li> Tracking fix times.
<li> Recording compiler defects.
</ul>

<p><h3><A NAME = "open">Opening a DRL file</a></h3>

The function dfm*xemacs*open-drl-file (invoked by a keystroke 
such as control-c control-k or by selecting the "Open DRL file"
menu item) sets the file in which  subsequent defect
entries will be stored.  

<p>

Although you can always invoke this function manually, Defmacs will invoke
it automatically if you try to add a defect and no DRL file is currently
open.  Therefore, if you are content to add all defects during an Emacs
session to a single DRL file, you typically do not need to invoke this
function explicitly.  Instead, you can just invoke dfm*xemacs*add-defect
(using the corresponding keystroke or menu item), and if no Defmacs DRL
file is currently open, it will invoke dfm*xemacs*open-drl-file for you.

<P>

When dfm*xemacs*open-drl-file is invoked, it prompts you with the
following:
<pre>
Load existing DRL file? (y or n)
</pre>

If you type 'y', then then a dialog box (or minibuffer prompt) appears with
a file and directory specification.  Select the DRL file you wish to open from
this list. The default value will be the most recently written DRL file from
the directory specified in the call to <tt>dfm*user*set-drl-directory</tt>.

<P>

If you type 'n', then Defmacs will prompt you for a file name
prefix. This defaults to  ``drl-'', but you can change this 
to a prefix providing more information about
the defects within the file. Once you type RETURN, the DRL file name 
will be generated by appending the prefix value with a timestamp with the format
MMDDHHMMSS and the suffix ``.drl''.  For example, if you
invoked this function on January 1 at exactly 12:30 and accepted
the default prefix by typing RETURN immediately, the file name 
generated would be ``drl-0101123000.drl''. 
<P>

Defmacs uses timestamped filenames to eliminate worries about overwriting
previously collected defect data. They also allow multiple developers to
collaboratively collect and share defect data using a common prefix without
worrying (much) about duplicate file names.

<P>

Explicit invocation of dfm*xemacs*open-drl-file is required in the
situation where you want to put defects into several different DRL
files during a single Defmacs session. (This can occur when the user
collects defects for several different work products and wants to keep them
in separate files.) 


<p><h3><A NAME = "add">Adding a defect</a></h3>

<h4>Popping up the Defmacs window</h4>

The function dfm*xemacs*add-defect (which is typically bound to a
keystroke, such as control-c control-]) splits the screen to include a new
window for entering information about a new defect.
Here is an example screen image for the first defect entry in a session:

<p>
<IMG SRC="screens/defmacs-add1.gif"> 
<p>

There are several things to observe in this initial screen image:

<ul>
<p><li> Although Leap defects contain over a dozen fields, only 
the eight fields that were specified in the configuration process
using <tt>dfm*xemacs*set-visible-fields</tt> are visible in this window. 
The actual stored entry will contain all of the LEAP fields, but their
values will be blank. 

<p><li> None of the fields are filled in by default, since this is the first 
entry.  Subsequent invocations of dfm*xemacs*add-defect will pop up
a window where many of these fields will be pre-filled with values
taken from the last entered defect.

<p><li> The center of the bottom modeline contains the name of the Defmacs
DRL file into which this entry will be stored. In the above example, the
file is called "drl-test-0529113855.drl". This file name was generated by
taking the prefix previously supplied by the user ("drl-test-") and
appending a timestamp (May 29, 11:38:55 am), and the suffix ".drl" (for
defect recording log).

<p><li> The left corner of the bottom modeline contains the field "[1/1]",
where the first number indicates the current position of the displayed
defect, and the second number indicates the total number of defects
currently stored in the Defmacs DRL file.  In the above example, "[1/1]"
indicates that the displayed defect is the first entry in the file, and
there is a total of one defect in the file.
</ul>

<h4>Entering defect data</h4>

Entering data about a defect involves filling out one or more of the
visible fields.  Each field entry must occupy a single line (though it can
be of any length.) This is a design constraint made to improve the 
efficiency of Defmacs processing, and is not shared by other Leap tools
in which multi-line defect entry is possible. There are several things
to note about defect data entry:

<ul>
<p><li> In the Defmacs buffer, the keystroke "Enter" causes the Defmacs
window to disappear and the Defmacs DRL file to be written out. (This
particular keystroke is used because all Defmacs entries must occupy 
a single line. Use control-n and control-p or the mouse to move between
fields.)

<p><li> If you inadvertently type "Enter", you can make the Defmacs
window reappear containing the last entered defect by invoking the
function dfm*xemacs*display-current-defect (which is typically bound
to control-c control-l).  

<p><li>  The LEAP toolset allows you to declare values for
many fields, such as Project, DocID, DefType, Injected, Removed, and so forth.
By specifying the Leap files containing these definitions
as part of the configuration process, 
Defmacs will be able to generate popup menus containing these values.
Right mousing over over the field of interest and  selecting a value will
fill in the corresponding field with that value, replacing the 
current contents, if any.

</ul>


<p><h3><A NAME = "scroll">Defmacs buffer commands</a></h3>

The Defmacs buffer is actually a specialized view of the underlying 
DRL file. In this view, the buffer has been narrowed to display only 
a single defect, and the contents of the narrowed region has been
filtered to show only those lines containing a visible defect field.
(In addition, each line in the underlying DRL file contains some
HTML code which is also hidden in this view.)  
<p>

To facilitate manipulation of the underlying file, Defmacs mode binds a
number of keystrokes to special commands. These keystrokes are only
available when the point is within the Defmacs buffer, as is the case when
entering or editing defects.  The currently available commands are:

<p>
<table border>

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> meta-?
<td> Displays a new window containing one-line summaries of all the
available help commands.

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Return
<td> Closes the window and saves the DRL file to disk.

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Control-n
<td> Move down to the next visible field line.

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Control-p
<td> Move up to the previous visible field line.

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Meta-n
<td> Scroll to the next defect entry in the file.

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Meta-p
<td> Scroll to the previous defect entry in the file.

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Meta-r
<td> Reload the current DRL file and display the last defect. (In some
cases, Defmacs fails to format entries correctly.  This function is 
provided to quickly reinitialize the system.)

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Right mouse
<td> When over a field name, pops up a set of selectable values for that field.

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Shift right mouse
<td> When over the "Fix Time" field, pops up a menu containing an
elapsed time in minutes since the time that the entry was created
or the timer was reset. 

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Shift middle mouse
<td> (This isn't a defmacs-mode command, but is included in this section for
completeness.) When over a compilation error in compilation mode,
shift-middle-mouse will create a new Defmacs entry and pre-fill the
location and description fields with data from the compilation error line.

</table>


<p><h3><A NAME = "fixtimes">Tracking fix times</a></h3>

One useful measurement related to a defect is the time required to find and
remove it.  Defmacs provides some simple automated support for tracking
this "fix time" data.  Whenever a defect is entered, Defmacs saves a
(hidden) timestamp recording the time the entry was created. Then, whenever
the user shift-right-mouses over the fix time field, a pop-up window
appears indicating the number of minutes since the time the defect entry
was created.  The following screen image shows this pop up field with the
elapsed time value (7 minutes) associated with the displayed defect:

<p>
<IMG SRC="screens/defmacs-fixtime.gif"> 
<p>

This pop-up menu provides two options---increment and clear timer:
<p>
<table border>
<tr>

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Increment
<td> Select the minute value (in this example, "7"), which adds 
     the value "7" to whatever integer value is stored in the fix time
     field and resets the timer to 0.

<tr>
<td valign="Top"> Clear timer
<td> Select "Clear Timer", which replaces the current stored
timestamp with one representing the current time. 

</table>

<p>

Defmacs supports the following approach to fix time 
collection.  First, you should reset the timestamp when you begin to 
work on a defect.  This means either pressing "Clear Timer" if a defect
entry already exists, or else creating the defect entry.  When you have
found and fixed the defect, or when you decide to shift to a different
activity, you can increment the fix time field with the time spent on
this defect.  Whenever you return to working on the defect, you begin
by finding the defect entry, resetting the timestamp, then resuming work.

<p><h3><A NAME = "compile-mode">Recording compiler defects</a></h3>

XEmacs supplies a generic compilation mode that enables "point-and-click"
traversal to the line containing the indicated compiler error.  Compilation
mode handlers have been implemented for virtually all major programming
languages.

Defmacs provides an interface to compilation mode that enables a
compilation error to be recorded as a Defmacs entry with a single mouse
click. To enable this feature, Defmacs must be configured for 
compilation mode, as discussed in the configuration section of this
chapter.

<p>

Once configured for compilation mode, pressing shift-middle-mouse over a
compiler defect will create a new Defmacs defect entry with the location
field filled with the file name and line number, and the description field
filled with the compiler error description.  The following screen image
shows the three windows that result from pressing shift-middle-mouse over a
compiler defect.  The top window is the Java source code, the middle window
is the compiler defects window, and the bottom window is the newly created
Defmacs entry containing the two pre-filled fields.
