<p><li><em> I've installed Leap, and it crashes mysteriously, 
and things seem to take a long time.</em><br>

The very first thing you need to make sure about is that you have an
adequately powered system for Leap.  You'll need at least a 200Mhz
Pentium processor or above for PCs, and analogous power on a Mac or
Unix system, and, to be safe, about 64MB RAM. 
<p>
We have also found that the current performance of Leap on SUN platforms
is pretty bad.  We conjecture that this is a problem with the current
JRE we are shipping with the SUN version.  We will work on this and let
you know. 

<p><li><em> Popup menus don't seem to work.</em><br>

The most common cause of this is the lack of any loaded Leap definitions.
When you bring up Leap from the Start menu, for example, no Leap 
definition files are loaded.  This means that there is nothing for the
popup menus to display.  For popup menus to work, you should have some
definitions loaded, such as those in the file sample.defs in the demo
directory.

<p><li><em>I can't access the "Project" field in the Iole (the size viewer).</em><br>

This is by design.  The "Project" field in this table is read-only because
it is computed by Leap.  For a given size entry, Leap checks the the file
specifications and date fields of each defined project, and fills
in this field if there is a match.  The approach used to associate 
size entries with projects is relatively straightforward, but does involve
making sure that the file specs and dates all match up.  The upcoming 
User Guide chapters on size and projects will clarify this in detail.

<p><li><em>Using Naia to enter previous time data is very tedious; I have
to fill in the date and time fields and can't simply type a 
delta time.</em><br>

We agree. We are designing a new time entry tool geared specifically 
to this situation that should help people record prior time intervals
more quickly and easily.  Stay tuned.

<p><li><em>Sometimes the titles of windows don't correlate with
their contents.  It might say "Save Tables" when the dialog box
is actually confirming a deletion of rows.</em><br>

This appears to be a Swing bug. Cross your fingers for the next release.

<p><li><em>Leap core dumps if, after bring it up, you select
"Extension->Load Extension".</em><br>

This is a bug. We will fix it by the time there are actually useful 
extensions available for Leap.  (Extensions will be documented in an
upcoming chapter of the User Guide.)

<p><li><em>I hid some rows using the "Hide Rows" button, but I don't know
how to bring them back!</em><br>

Currently, you need to shift-click on a column title to 
bring up the "Filter" dialog box, then select "Unhide all"
to redisplay hidden rows. This is clearly bogus---we'll 
provide an "Unhide rows" button in the next release or 
some other more obvious solution. 

<p><li><em>The user guide does not describe &lt;feature X&gt;</em><br>

The user guide is still under construction. Please let us know
about missing materials so we can make sure to include them.


<p><li><em> When I'm entering a defect description, sometimes the window gets small and 
I can't see what I'm typing.  What's wrong?</em> <br>
We apologize. This is a defect in the JClass Table component. They have
been notified and we hope this defect will be fixed soon.

<p><li><em> Sometimes after I select a  field in a table, the mouse cursor disappears and 
I can't see where the next character will be inserted. What's
wrong?</em><br>
We apologize. This is another defect in the JClass table component. We
hope this defect will be fixed in a future release.

<p><li><em> I pulled down the Data or Definitions menu in the Leap Tool Set
window, selected a tool to display, but nothing appeared. What's
wrong?</em><br> The most likely reason: you've already invoked that tool
and then minimized it.  Once you've invoked the tool and minimized it, you
need to maximize it to see it.  The less likely reason: you have a LEAP
process running and you upgrade to a new version of LEAP without bringing
it down.  You should always quit all your LEAP processes (and uninstall the
current version of LEAP) before installing a new version.
