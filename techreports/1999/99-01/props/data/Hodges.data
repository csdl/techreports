<td type=Description>"SInce these improvements represent a real change
in individual performance.."  Whoa!  You need to 
at least preface this by saying that the SEI *claims*
that these improvements represent a real change.
One of the major points of Anne's research is to
show that changes in PSP measures may *not*
necessarily represent "real change in individual
performance".

<td type=Description>I am totally confused by this paragraph. It seems like you are
assuming that there were two data quality studies, one
done by Anne and one done as part of Project LEAP,
when in fact there was only one study and it was
referenced in both places.  I don't know what you're
referring to when you say "this time the study is based
on four groups of engineers" at all.
