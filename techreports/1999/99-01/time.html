<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "Motivation">Motivation for time recording</a></h2>

One of the most important skills you must acquire to become a world class
software professional is time management. There are dozens of self-help
books available that concern time management, from "The Seven Habits of
Highly Effective People" to "The One Minute Manager".  These books provide
a valuable, generic perspective on time management and its role in 
helping you take control of your daily activities and accomplish your 
primary personal and professional goals .

<p>

Leap aids in time management through automated support for recording and
analyzing <em>effort</em>: the amount of time you devote to important
work-related tasks.  Leap provides two tools for effort recording and
analysis, one called Io (which is Hawaiian for "Hawaiian Hawk") and one
called Naia (which is Hawaiian for "porpoise").

<p>

In addition to the generic benefits identified in the self-help books, and
in addition to the specific quantitative process improvements we will
discuss later, time management using Leap tends to provide the following
immediate benefits:
<ul>

<p><li> <em>You become more focussed on the task at hand.</em> An immediate
consequence of active time management using automated tools like Leap is
that you become more aware of what you <em>intend</em> to be doing during a
given time period.  When you start the Leap timer to record effort devoted
to a given project, you are effectively making an explicit commitment to
yourself to work on that activity, and it helps you to concentrate on that
task.

<p><li> <em>You become more aware of procrastination.</em> Once you commit to
recording the effort spent on a project, you also become more acutely aware
of the time you <em>don't</em> spend on the project!  Time tracking helps
make clear when days begin to slip away without any effort devoted to a 
specific task.

<p><li> <em>You become aware of the rareness of "direct hours".</em> The
term "direct hours" is another popular term for "effort", and refers to the
time spent directly focussed on a particular project, as opposed to time
spent on unrelated activities like eating, sleeping, talking with friends,
talking on the phone, reading email, surfing the web, etc.  Once you begin
to track effort on important projects, you will become aware of how few
direct hours you typically have in a day or a week to devote to your 
major projects.  This helps you plan better, and also can help you 
understand how to re-organize your work schedule in order to make more
direct hours available for your major projects.

</ul>
<p>

Tracking effort, even with the Leap toolset, takes a certain amount of
work.  And there will be times when you are away from the Leap toolset
and need to record the effort you devoted to a project on a piece of paper for
entering into the tool later. Because tracking your effort does take some work,
we recommend that most people track effort on one or at most two projects at
a time.

<p>


While it may be tempting at first to try to track all the time you spend on
everything, the danger is that you will find it too time-consuming and give
up entirely.  So, track your effort on just one or two of your most
important projects. If you are just recording time on one or two projects,
then the overhead of time recording will not seem very significant, and it
will also have the positive effect of focussing you more on those one or
two activities (since those are the ones you are recording time effort on.)

<p><hr><p><h2><a name = "Io">Io: A "real-time" time recording tool</a></h2>

There are two principal tools for time data entry and analysis in Leap: Io
and Naia.  The Io tool is designed for use in "real-time"---for recording
time data while you're working.  The Naia tool is designed for use 
"off-line"---when you need to enter time data from work in the past, or 
edit time data previously entered using Io or Naia.  
<p>
Here's a screen shot of the Io tool after you invoke it from the Leap
toolset data menu, annotated with some explanatory text.

<p>
<img src="screens/io-start-caption.gif" width=100%>
<p>

When you use Io to record time, you can specify the name of the 
project you are working on, the phase of development you are in, the
type of document you are working on, and a brief description of the
current activity.  Note that none of these values are <em>required</em>:
Io can be used to simply record start and stop times.  However, as you will 
see, by providing this additional information about the context in
which this time was spent, Leap can provide you with significantly
more useful kinds of information.  So, it's useful for you to provide
this information, and we'll show you how in a moment.
<p>

<p><hr><p><h3><a name = "simpleTime">Simple time interval recording</a></h3>

First, however, let's just learn how to use the effort timer.  To start
recording effort, you simply press the "Start/Stop Timer" button.  Try that
now.  You should find that the field to the right of this button has turned
to green and is now accumulating time, like this:
<p>
<img src="screens/io-timing1.gif" width=100%>
<p>
If you press the Start/Stop button again, you complete the recording of a 
single time interval, as illustrated here:

<p>
<img src="screens/io-timing2.gif" width=100%>
<p>

The above screen shows that I just recorded a time interval of 1 minute and
32 seconds. At this point, I can't simply press the Start/Stop button
again to add more effort, because Io can only represent one time interval at
a time. If I press the Start/Stop button again, Io will present me with
a dialog box asking me if I want to delete the current time interval and
start over again:


<p>
<img src="screens/io-timing3.gif">
<p>
 
If you try this and get this dialog box, press "Cancel" to return to
Io with a time interval of a minute or so displayed. Once a completed time
interval is displayed in Io, you have two choices for what you can do with
it: "Record" it or "Clear" it. Both of these choices are provided by
buttons on the right hand side of the tool.

<p>

If you press the "Clear" button, then you will reset the time interval to
the right of the Start/Stop button to 0:00, and you can now begin recording
a new time interval by pressing the Start/Stop button.  In general, you
will "clear" time intervals whenever you make a mistake in Io and want to
delete the currently displayed time interval and start over.

<p>

If you press the "Record" button, on the other hand, then you 
make the displayed time interval "official" within Leap. (Don't worry,
even if you press "Record" on a bogus time interval, there are ways to fix
it using Naia.)  When you press "Record", Io will record the currently
displayed time interval, then reset the displayed interval to 0:00. Io is
now ready for you to press Start/Stop to begin another effort entry.  Try
pressing the "Record" button now to record your currently displayed time
entry.

<p>

Naturally, you are now wondering what you just did!  What does it means to
"record" and thus make an effort entry in Leap "official"?  In general terms,
you can think of Io as providing a "buffer", or temporary storage area, for
building a single effort entry record in real-time.  When you press "Record",
Io sends this temporary effort entry off to another part of Leap for more permanent
storage and analysis.  The tool that provides you with a view on this more
permanent representation of time entries is called "Naia".
<p>

I will cover Naia in more detail in a moment, but it may help you start to
understand what's going on if you now go back to the Leap Toolset window
and invoke Naia.  Here's what it would look like:

<p>
<img src="screens/naia1.gif" width=100%>
<p>

In other words, by pressing "record" in Io, you've sent that time interval
data to Naia, where it is now displayed. (One way to see this visually is
to open both Io and Naia at the same time, then create an effort entry in Io,
then press Record.  The current effort entry in Io will disappear and
reappear instantly in Naia.)

It is also interesting to note that the same information about a time
interval is displayed somewhat differently in Io and Naia.  In Naia, the
actual start and stop dates and times are explicitly represented. In the
above screenshot, you can now see that I started the Io timer for this
example on January 21, 1999 at 11:12am, and stopped timing at 11:13am, for
an elapsed time of 1 minute, as shown in the "delta" column.  Io, on the
other hand, does not display dates or the start/stop times. Instead,
Io represents the interval between the start and stop time in minutes
and seconds. Naia does not display seconds and simply rounds the interval
down to the nearest minute. 

<p>

So, to review: you can build a time interval entry in "real-time" using Io.
Once you've completed building this time interval, you press "Record" to 
send it off to Naia.  As I will show you later, you use Naia to
edit time intervals, so you can fix errors you made using Io with Naia.
Also, you can enter time intervals into Naia directly, without using Io at
all. This is useful, for example, when you work on a project away from
your computer and record your time on a scrap of paper. When you later
want to enter this time, you will use Naia to do it. 

<p><hr><p><h3><a name = "interrupts">Recording interruptions</a></h3>

So far, recording a time interval looks pretty much like an all or nothing
affair: you press Start/Stop once to start the timer, you press Start/Stop
again to stop the timer, and then you either clear it or record it. 
If our lives were uncomplicated affairs, without ringing phones, 
vibrating pagers, Instant Message alerts, and so forth, this might be all
that you would need.  However, in the real world, interruptions are a way
of life.  

<p>

Io supports the ability to temporarily suspend the timer with the
Pause/Resume Interrupt button. Say you are working on a project, and Io is
recording time for you. Then the phone rings.  By pressing the Interrupt
button, you suspend the green-colored effort timer, and begin accumulating
"Interrupt" time, which is indicated with a yellow field, as illustrated
next:

<p>
<img src="screens/io-timing4.gif" width=100%>
<p>

Here I began recording a time interval, then pressed the Interrupt button
after only 10 seconds of effort. (The phone rang.)  Now, my accumulated
effort is suspended at 10 seconds, and the interrupt timer is tracking the
amount of time wasted by this interruption.  The screen above shows that 4
seconds have so far elapsed in this interruption.
<p>

When the interruption ends and you are ready to resume work on a task, then
you simply press the Interrupt button again, and the timer associated with
effort will once again start to accumulate time, while the interrupt timer
will become suspended: 

<p>
<img src="screens/io-timing5.gif" width=100%>
<p>

This screen shows that my first interrupt
lasted 23 seconds before I returned to the task, and now I have accumulated
20 seconds of effort.

<p>

Unlike the Start/Stop button, which can only be pressed once to begin
a given time interval and once to end a given time interval, you can
record as many interruptions as you want using the Interrupt button. 
As the last screen shows, it is not uncommon to have more interrupt
time than effort time in a given time interval.  This particular
situation of having more interrupts than effort in a given time 
interval is a very simple indication that your productivity is 
probably being adversely affected by the level of interruption in 
your work environment.

<p>

The Interrupt button works well when you remember to press it at the 
beginning of an interruption and remember to press it again at the 
end of an interruption.  Of course, in many situations, you forget
to do this and notice sometime later that you are accumulated effort
time during what should really have been an interruption.  Io provides
a simple way to add in those interrupt times "after the fact" with
the "Increment Interrupt" button.  Pressing this button brings up
a dialog box that allows you to enter an integer representing the
number of minutes to add to the interrupt time (and subtract from
the effort time):

<p>
<img src="screens/incinterrupt.gif">
<p>

This screen shows this dialog box just after I have typed in "5",
indicating that I would like to add five minutes to my total 
interrupt time so far, and subtract five minute from my total
effort time so far.

<p><hr><p><h3><a name = "context">Providing contextual information:  project, document type, phase</a></h3>

By now, you should be comfortable with the idea that Io is used to 
record the effort you devote to a specific task in terms of a single
time interval at a time.  This time interval can include one or more
interruptions, which can be recorded by either pressing the 
Pause/Resume Interrupt button or the Increment Interrupt Time button.
A given time interval in Io is explicitly entered into Leap using the
Record button, and that data can then be viewed and possibly modified
using the Naia tool.

<p>

Before getting into the specification of contextual information, it is
useful to note that it is possible to learn a few interesting things about
your working habits by simple analysis of effort entries such as those I
showed you above. For example, by simply recording the effort you devote to
any major work activity, you can use Leap to learn how many direct hours of
effort you typically have per day or per week.  If you decided that your
current allocation of direct hours is too low, you could make changes to
your working habits and use Leap to see if those changes are, indeed,
resulting in more direct hours being recorded per week.  Alternatively, you
might set a goal of devoting two direct hours of effort per day to major
tasks, and use Leap to monitor your progress toward the achievement of this
goal. 

<p>

However, several additional kinds of analyses become available to you when
you supply contextual information with your effort data.  Leap provides
direct support for four kinds of contextual information in each effort
entry record: the <em>Project</em> associated with this effort , the
<em>Phase</em> of development in which this effort occurred, the
<em>Document Type</em> associated with this effort (if any), and an
unstructured textual <em>Description</em> that can contain a comment about
the effort in that particular interval.  You do not need to record all of
this contextual information for every single effort entry. Furthermore, you
do not even need to record all of this information at the moment that the
effort entry is made--you can always go back and add it later using Naia.
Finally, you can always use Naia to revise and update contextual
information later. Let's now look at why Leap gives you the opportunity to
supply each of the four pieces of contextual information.


<p>

First, the Project field is perhaps the single most important piece of contextual
information that you can associate with an effort entry.  Project
definition is discussed in detail in another chapter, but for now, each
Leap project typically represents a relatively short duration (1-3 week)
work activity for which most effort is focussed primarily on one type of
work product.  One very typical Leap project is the review of a design
document by a small group, which usually takes about a week or two to
complete.  Another typical Leap project is the enhancement of a system to
add a new piece of functionality through addition/modification of several
hundred lines of code.  Another typical Leap project is the writing of the
first draft of a book chapter.  

<p>

By specifying the project that is the object of the effort in each entry,
you can determine not only how many direct hours are available to you per
day or per week, but how that effort is allocated among your major
tasks. In addition, once you associate effort data with a project, you can then
gather size data on that project and use these two kinds of data to obtain
a measure of productivity---the amount of time it requires you to produce a
given unit of a work product.  As a simple example of this productivity
calculation, I recently wrote a small grant proposal which was 3,150 words
long and required 361 minutes of effort. My productivity on this grant
proposal was thus 523 words/hour.  On the other hand, I recently expanded a
conference paper into a journal article, in which I added/modified about
6,440 words over a little more than 1000 minutes of effort for a rate of
about 350 words/hour. Over time, as I gather more productivity data of this
type, I can find out what my productivity range is and use that to help me
estimate upper and lower bounds on how long it might take me to write a new
proposal, given some estimate of its final size.  In addition, I might
relate productivity values with later defects discovered in the document
(or with the success or failure of the proposal!)  Such correlations could
help me by revealing to me that a productivity rate of over 500 words/hour
indicates a "rush job" which will tend to have lots of defects and will be
less likely to be successful.

<p>

Second, you to specify the document type to be associated with
an effort entry.  Knowledge of the
specific document type worked on during a given time interval is quite
useful for projects where documents of different types are produced or
modified.  For example, in a software development situation, a given system
increment might require writing and/or modifying some low-level device
driver code in C and other high level user interface code in Java. By
recording which document type ("C Source" or "Java Source") you focus on
during each effort interval, Leap can help you find out, for example, that
your average productivity when hacking low-level C device driver code is
about 5 lines of code per hour, while your average productivity hacking
Java user interface code is about 15 lines of code per hour.  In this
situation, if you didn't keep track of the document type, you might 
have ended up with an average productivity for "coding" of 10 lines
of code per hour, which is off by 100% for both your Java coding and
your C coding.


<p>

Third, you can specify the phase of the activity addressed during the
effort entry. For certain projects, it can be helpful to define a "Phase
Set": a set of phases that you typically engage in during the
activity. 
For example, when I write a paper for publication in a conference, my
effort typically involves three phases: the creation of an initial
draft, then a review stage, then a final draft.  For small programming
projects, my effort involves design, implementation, review, testing, and
release phases.  By recording the phase associated with each effort 
interval, Leap can provide me with a breakdown of how my effort was
divided up among phases for a particular project, and how that 
breakdown of effort compares to my average breakdown of effort for
all projects using that particular phase set. Such information can
be very useful: for example, it might reveal that projects
with high amounts of testing effort also contained low amounts of
design effort or review effort. 

<p>

Fourth and finally, Io you can add an unstructured "comment" to each effort
entry using the description field.  Comment fields are saved with each
effort entry, but are not otherwise manipulated by Leap, and no analyses
upon comments are provided.  You may find them useful if you want to
remember some peculiarity of an effort interval for later reflection. For
example, you might find that you are almost constantly interrupted during a
given effort interval, and decide to write a comment in the description
field noting that fact. (While Leap records the cumulative amount of
interruption time, it does not record the total number of interruptions.
During a three hour interval, one 60 minute interruption is probably much
less intrusive than 60 one minute interruptions, but Leap does not
distinguish between the two.)

<p>


In Io, you can specify the Project, Phase, and Doc Type in one of two ways:
either by typing the value in by hand, or by selecting a predefined value
from the pull down menus associated with these three fields.  I do not
recommend the manual typing approach, because it is time consuming to type
in these values, and it might lead to you indicating the same field value
in slightly different ways on different occasions. For example, you might
be working on a requirements specification for an accounting application,
and one day type in the project as "Reqs Spec" and another day as "Account
Reqs". Of course, Leap cannot recognize these two time intervals as
belonging to the same project.  
<p>

To avoid typing in project, phase, and document type data by hand, you must
define values for these fields using some of the other Leap tools: Ilio for
projects, Ulua for phases, and Puaa for document types.  It is not hard to
define your own projects, phases, and document types, and other chapters in
this user guide will cover this definition process in detail.  For the
moment, the file called "sample.defs" in the leap/demo directory provides
some sample definitions for projects, phases, and document types.  After
I load this file into Leap, Io's pull-down menus allow me to use
its menus to begin recording, for example, the effort associated with planning the
review of the design document for "Bar V 1.0" in the following way:

<p>
<img src="screens/io-timing6.gif" width=100%>
<p>

This concludes the introduction to effort recording using Io.  The next
section describes Naia, a tool which, in addition to collecting time data,
also provides you with access to some of the analyses involving
effort provided by Leap.


<p><hr><p><h2><A NAME = "Naia">Naia: Effort entry editing and analysis</a></h2>

The Naia tool, like Io, is used to record effort information, but Naia is
oriented more toward "off-line" use.  Whereas Io allows you to manipulate
only a single, "current" effort entry, Naia displays all the effort entries
you have loaded into the Leap tool, and allows you to edit, delete, or add
new entries as you wish. Here is a sample illustration of Naia:

<p>
<img src="screens/naia2.gif" width=100%>
<p>


By default, Naia displays eight fields for each effort entry: the Project,
Phase, DocType, Start timestamp, Stop timestamp, cumulative interrupt time 
in minutes, cumulative direct effort time (i.e. delta time) in minutes, 
and an unstructured text description field. 

<p>

Naia is one of the "table-based" Leap tools, and thus there is significant
amount of "generic" functionality available within Naia that is shared by
all table-based Leap tools.  For details on pop-up menus, sorting,
filtering, hiding and showing columns and rows, resizing columns and rows,
and so forth, please consult the chapter entitled <A
HREF="tables.html">"Generic Table Functionality"</A>.  
<p>

<p><hr><p><h3><a name = "naiaEdit">Editing effort data</a></h3>

Naia provides pop-up menus to access the predefined values for the
Project, Phase, and DocType fields. In addition to these generic pop-up
menus, Naia provides special pop-up menus for the Start timestamp and 
Stop timestamp fields. These pop-up menus allow you access to a 
calendar-based widget for editing the start and stop times and dates. 
An illustration of this widget follows:

<p>
<img src="screens/calendar.gif">
<p>

This widget is a little unintuitive to use, because you must always click
on a date to "commit" the edit of a date and time, even if you are only
editing the time value.  So, for example, assume the calendar above
represents a start time. It is currently set to December 14, 1998 at 11:10
am, and assume that you want to change this start time to 11:30am on the
same day.  After using the spin boxes to change the time value, you must
now click on the darkened "14" box to commit this change to the time value.
If you don't click on a date as your final action to commit an edit of a
time or date, the widget will revert back to it's original value (i.e
11:10am, in this case) when the calendar widget closes.

<p>

You don't have to use this calendar widget all the time.  You can also edit
a Start timestamp or Stop timestamp field by hand by simply clicking in the
field and editing the text string.  However, Naia will not let you tab out
of the field until the timestamp string can be parsed correctly.  Note that
the pop-up menu also provides a "Clear date" option, which allows you to
blank out a Start or Stop field if you desire.  Finally, simply clicking in
a Start or Stop field automatically fills it in with the current time and
date.

<p>

You cannot enter a delta time--the total effort associated with an
entry--by hand in Naia.  Delta times are derived values: they are
determined automatically by computing the interval in minutes between the
Start and Stop times, and subtracting out any Interrupt time.  Delta times
(like the Project field in Iole) are shown in italics to indicate that the
value is computed by the tool and cannot be entered by hand.

<p>
There is a kind of "one-way" relationship between Naia and Io.  When you 
press "Record" in Io, you send the current effort entry displayed in 
Io to Naia.  However, there is no "reverse" direction: there is no way
to send an effort entry from Naia back to Io.  Once an entry exists in 
Naia, you must manage it using Naia from then on. 

<p><hr><p><h3><a name = "naiaAnalysis">Analyzing effort data</a></h3>

As with almost all of the table-based tools in Leap, Naia offers you 
several analyses on the set of displayed entries in the tool. Currently, 
these analyses include the Direct Hour Trend, the Direct Hours per Project
Trend, the Direct Hours per Phase Trend, and the Direct Hours per DocType
Trend. 

<p>

The Direct Hour Trend provides a bar chart of the total number of direct
hours of effort you devoted to all of your projects over time, as
calculated from the entries currently displayed in Naia.  Time can be
measured in days, weeks, or months.  Here is an example of one such bar
chart:


<p>
<img src="screens/naiaAnalysis1.gif" width=100%>
<p>

You use this bar chart to obtain a sense of your aggregate direct hour effort
on all your projects over time.  The above screen shot shows my direct hour
effort on a daily basis over 17 days.  Apart from two days where direct 
hours climbed above five hours, I devoted effort to my major research projects 
at a rate of about one to two hours per day. Furthermore,
I devoted no effort to my major research projects on almost a third of
those days.
<p>

The Direct Hours per Project Trend provides a bar chart of the number of
direct hours you devote on a project-by-project basis over time, as 
calculated from the entries currently displayed in Naia. Once again, 
time can be measured in days, weeks, or months. Here is an example of
this second analysis for the same time period:

<p>
<img src="screens/naiaAnalysis2.gif" width=100%>
<p>
This chart is a bit more informative, since it shows which project obtained
direct hours on each day.  Here you can see that my "big day" during this
period was devoted to the "SunAEG" project, and that on January 10, I spent
time on two projects.

<p>

Note that these charts allow you to shift-drag to move the 
visible portion of the chart around.   The Direct Hours per Phase Trend
and Direct Hours per DocType trend are similar to the above chart and
will not be shown here. 

<p>
The analyses in Naia are all focussed exclusively on time.  Leap provides 
many more analyses that use time data in combination with other data such 
as size or defects, but these analyses are obtained through the project
"condensation" mechanism.   See the chapter on Project definition
and interpretation for more details. 


<h2><a name ="reflections">Reflecting upon time data</a></h2>

Although it doesn't take a lot of effort to record time data, it does take
some effort, and unless you learn something helpful about yourself from
the activity, it won't make sense for you to do it. Here are some helpful
questions for reflection that you can use at the end of each project to 
help you understand more about the way you work and how you can work
more efficiently and effectively in the future. Note that the Naia
analysis menu can provide charts helpful in answering many of these
questions. 

<ul>
<p><li> How much effort was required for me to complete this project?  Did this
project take more effort or less effort than I expected? If so, why?

<p><li> How many days elapsed from the first day I recorded time on this
project to the last?  Was this elapsed calendar time more or less than
I expected?  Why?

<p><li> Looking just at the days between the start and end of this project,
did I work on this project every day?  Most days?  Less than half the days?
Was the work "bursty" or did I work fairly evenly across the project time
frame? 

<p><li> During what times of day did I record effort on this project? 
What insights does this data give me into when I am most productive?
If I needed to, what changes could I make to my environment to increase
the times in which I am productive?

<p><li> What does the interrupt data tell me about my ability to obtain
uninterrupted time?  Are there times of day when I appear to be 
interrupted less?  Are there times when my interrupt time exceeds my 
delta time?  Since uninterrupted time is important to achieving higher
productivity and quality, what changes can I make to decrease interrupt
time?

</ul>
