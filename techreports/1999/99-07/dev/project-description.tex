\section{Project Description}
%No more than 1000 words

\subsection{Introduction}
% 82 words

The people of Hawaii are focusing new effort and emphasis on support for
small business.  The initial development of a small business depends upon
many factors, but one of the most important is a high quality business
plan: a roadmap that describes what the business is, why it can be
successful, and how it will be organized and operate over time.  The best
business plans are living documents that evolve and change to reflect the
growth and maturation of the organization.

\subsection{The Problem With Current Business Plan Development}
%What problem are you solving?
% 166 words

Many entrepreneurs do not develop business plans before they start their
business or the business plan they develop is not a good one.  There are
many barriers to developing a good business plan; there is little or no
feedback on the business plan, there are few, if any, sources of checklists
for developing good business plans, and there are very few repositories
where entrepreneurs can learn from examples of a variety of business plans.

Entrepreneurs rarely get their business plans reviewed before they start to
shop it around for venture capital.  This is too late in the development
cycle.  First impressions are very difficult to overcome.  An entrepreneur
with a poor business plan has a low chance of getting their business
funded.

There are very few places for entrepreneurs to find localized advice on
developing business plans.  The many books and web sites on business plan
writing are intended for a global or national audience.  The solutions are
not tailored to Hawaii's unique business environment.


\subsection{Applying Software Engineering Principles to Business Plan Development}
%What is the solution to the problem?
% 265 words

I propose that many of these problems in the development of high quality
business plans can be solved by applying principles from software
engineering.  The three software engineering principles I propose to apply
are distributed review, defect collection and management, and patterns.  By
conducting reviews of early drafts of a business plan we can ensure that
the final version shown to the venture capitalists is of high quality and
provides a positive first impression.  If we collect the defects found in
the early drafts of the business plan we can develop checklists of common
problems encountered in business plan development.  Entrepreneurs can use
these checklists to avoid common problems.  By analyzing the defects
collected and the actual business plans we can develop patterns for
successful business plans.


Project LEAP and the Leap Toolkit support distributed review, defect
collection and management and patterns.  You can find more information
about project LEAP and the Leap Toolkit at the following web site.
\url{<http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Research/LEAP/LEAP.html>} The Leap Toolkit
is a general purpose mechanism for technical skill acquisition and
improvement. Currently, it is in use to support software development and
technical writing. With this grant, I will adapt the Leap Toolkit to
support the development and improvement of business plans in the State of
Hawaii. Entrepreneurs will use Leap to obtain useful reviews of their
business plans, to access and contribute helpful checklists that detect
common problems in local business plans, and to learn from and generate
new patterns that represent common features of and approaches to successful
Hawaii business plans.

\subsubsection{Usage Scenario}
%How will it actually work?
% 184 words 

Entrepreneur Cam wants to start a new business in Hawaii.  He needs to
write his business plan so he checks the Leap Business Plan Web Site to get
some good patterns for successful business plans.  Cam finds three patterns
that he wants to use.  Before he starts writing his plan he down-loads a
couple of checklists describing the most common errors made by new
entrepreneurs (see figure \ref{fig:checklist}).  By studying these
checklists Cam successfully avoids these pit-falls and saves many
frustrating hours in development.  After writing his draft plan Cam submits
the plan to the Leap Web site for review.  Volunteer reviewers review Cam's
plan and note several defects with the plan.  These defects are recorded in
Leap so Cam can easily track them and the defects are added to the Leap
Business Plan Web Site defect repository for later analysis.  Cam fixes the
few defects with his plan, gets his venture capital and starts a very
successful small business.  After setting up his successful business, Cam
contributes new checklists and patterns to the Leap Business Plan Web Site.

\subsection{Competing Technologies}
%Why is your solution unique?
% 175 words

Searching the web on Yahoo! I found many sites devoted to small business
development and business plan development.  Here is a sample:
\begin{itemize}

\item {Yahoo! Small Business
    \url{http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com}  provides links to resources for
    small businesses.  There are some links to books and suggestions for
    writing business plans, but no checklists or review services.}

\item {American Express Small Business Services
    \url{http://www6.americanexpress.com/smallbusiness/resources/starting/biz_plan} 
    gives outlines for business plans and good reasons for having a plan.
    There are some very general patterns for good business plans. However,
    this site does not have any specific information on local Hawaii conditions.}
  
\item {BizPlanIt.Com \url{http://www.bisplanit.com} looks like a company
    that write your business plan after talking to you.  There are no public
    checklists or patterns.  This might be a good model for a future
    commercialization of the Leap Business Plan Web Site.}
  
\end{itemize}

None of these sites focus on any local issues or provide facilities for
reviewing existing drafts of plans.

\subsection{Risks Involved}
% 123 words

%Risks in development
%Risk abatement plan

There are several risks to this project. First, can we transfer the software
engineering principles to business plan development?  Second, there are privacy
issues involved with business plans that must be addressed in the system.

This grant will provide an opportunity to address the first risk, by
providing the ability to develop a small prototype version and evaluate its
impact.

The second issue of privacy also exists in software development and we can
apply technology we are developing there to this domain.  One solution is
to provide a tool to make the Leap data anonymous.  The checklists and
patterns will not refer to any developer.  We will develop mechanisms for
submitting the business plans for review that will ensure the developer's
privacy.


%\subsection{Technical Infrastructure}

I plan on delivering the following: an Open Source distribution of Leap
Toolkit, a Web based Leap data repository, a tool to make Leap data
