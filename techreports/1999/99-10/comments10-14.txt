\section{Thesis objectives and contribution}

The objective of this thesis research is to develop, deploy, and evaluate
a high quality tool to support software engineers in the collection
of useful size measurement data.  The claim of this thesis is as 
follows:

\begin{quotation}
{\em LOCC is a generic, effective tool for collection and
evaluation of size measures to support software engineering
tasks such as project planning, estimation, and process
improvement.
\end{quotation}

In this research, LOCC was developed over two years. [provide
a paragraph talking about the long and twisted road of LOCC
development, along with some current stats on its size. Include
a screen dump here with a brief description.]

The initial version of LOCC was deployed [when? and to whom?]
Since then, approximately XX additional releases have been
made.  [provide more details about the deployment history
and how it is available on the web]

LOCC has been evaluated in three ways: through a functional comparison of
its capabilities with other size measurement tools; through its use in
measuring the size of XX Java programs, and through an online survey of
current LOCC users. [briefly summarize the results of these evaluations
here.]

This results indicate that the claim of this thesis has been largely met. 
The contributions of this thesis include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A generic architecture that facilitates implementation of different 
size measures for different work products, and even multiple size measures
for the same work product.
\item A system that supports experimentation into different size measures, 
enabling users to empirically determine which size measure works best for
them;
\item Support for structural differencing of systems;
\item An evaluation of one set of design decisions for structural
differencing of Java source code;
\item [others?]
\end{itemize}
