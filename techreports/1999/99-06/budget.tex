\section{Project Budget}
%No more than 1 page

The project budget consists of: A computer to serve as the web server for
the Leap Business Plan Developer's Web site, printing, graphics and postage
costs for developing and distributing training manuals and advertising, and
travel expenses for contacting business experts.

There may be small variations in the price of the equipment when the order
is actually placed due to bundling offers from manufactures, etc. Microsoft
Office 98 can be obtained from the UH Bookstore.
